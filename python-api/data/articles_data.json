SSA employees and their work will continue under the [temporary restraining order].\"\n\nA sign for the U.S. Social Security Administration is seen outside its headquarters in Woodlawn, Md., on Thursday, March 20, 2025. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nIn an order Thursday, U.S. District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander blocked the agency from granting personnel affiliated with DOGE access to agency systems containing personally identifiable information.\n\nIn a series of interviews on Thursday and Friday, Dudek appeared to suggest that the judge's ruling blocking DOGE from accessing SSA data would force him to pause Social Security payments and block all employees from the agency's systems.\n\n“My anti-fraud team would be DOGE affiliates. My IT staff would be DOGE affiliates,” he said to Bloomberg News on Thursday. “As it stands, I will follow it exactly and terminate access by all SSA employees to our IT systems.”\n\nHe continued, “Really, I want to turn it off and let the courts figure out how they want to run a federal agency.\"\n\nAnd in a separate Washington Post interview, he doubled down, suggesting \"everything in the agency\" deals with personally identifiable information, known as PII.\n\n“Everything in this agency is PII,” Dudek said. “Unless I get clarification, I’ll just start to shut it down. I don’t have much of a choice here.”\n\nThe judge pushed back Friday in a letter to counsel, writing that \"any suggestion that the Order may require the delay or suspension of benefit payments is incorrect.\"\n\nIn the letter, she wrote she was aware of the news reports with Dudek's comments laying out his belief that virtually all employees of SSA would fall within the scope of her order and thus have their access to the agency's IT systems terminated.\n\n\"Such assertions about the scope of the Order are inaccurate,\" the judge wrote. \"Employees of SSA who are not involved with the DOGE Team or in the work of the DOGE Team are not subject to the Order. … Moreover, any suggestion that the Order may require the delay or suspension of benefit payments is incorrect.\"\n\nAARP was one of several organizations that had blasted Dudek's comments threatening to close the agency.\n\n“Social Security has never missed a payment and AARP and our tens of millions of members are not going to stand by and let that happen now,\" Senior Vice President of Campaigns John Hishta said in a statement.",

And that's coming out of the Department of Education immediately,\" Trump said, adding that he believes it will be \"serviced much better\" than it has been.\n\nStudent loans are currently overseen by the Federal Student Aid Office within the Department of Education, and it handles not tens of thousands of dollars in loans but $1.6 trillion in loans for 43 million people.\n\nHowever, the SBA, which already handles billions of dollars in loans each year, has faced cuts since Trump took office, saying it would reduce its staff by 43% amid agencywide reorganization.\n\nThe SBA said it would \"eliminate approximately 2,700 active positions out of a total active workforce of nearly 6,500 through voluntary resignations, the expiration of COVID-era and other term appointments, and a limited number of reductions in force.\"\n\nThe Federal Student Aid Office employs over 1,000 employees, but it is unclear whether these employees would move under the SBA or how the agency would handle an influx in loans to manage.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds an executive order after signing it alongside Secretary of Education Linda McMahon (R) in the East Room of the White house in Washington, Mar. 20, 2025.

Kennedy Jr.'s HHS will handle \"special needs and all of the nutrition programs and everything else,\" conceding that it's \"rather complex.\"\n\n\"Those two elements will be taken out of the Department of Education, and then all we have to do is get the students to get guidance from the people that love them and cherish them,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president maintained that the core functions would remain intact.\n\n\"Pell Grants, Title 1, funding resources for children with disabilities and special needs will be preserved, fully preserved,\" Trump said Thursday before signing the bill. \"They're going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them.\"\n\nA view shows a placard during a Defend Our Schools rally to protest President Donald Trump's executive order to shut down the U.S.Department of Education outside its building in Washington, Mar. 21, 2025. Kent Nishimura/Reuters\n\nThe president did not offer any details about how exactly those portfolios would be transferred to other agencies, saying only that it would happen \"immediately.\"\n\nStudent Borrower Protection Center Executive Director Mike Pierce condemned the president's announcement, which education advocates have said has created chaos and confusion across the education landscape.\n\n\"Moving the student loan program to the SBA is illegal, unserious, and a clear attempt to distract the public from the fact that Trump has broken the student loan system and is actively cheating millions of borrowers out of their rights,\" Pierce said in a statement to ABC News.\n\nAt least one component of the plan -- moving the student loan system to another department -- is likely to face significant legal pushback.\n\nThe central legal issue is likely to focus on the Higher Education Act of 1965, which stipulates that the Federal Student Aid Office should be under the purview of the secretary of education.\n\n\"Congress has charged the secretary of education with administering the federal student aid program by issuing student loans and grants to support students' attainment of higher education,\" said Andrew Crook, press secretary for the American Federation of Teachers. \"The department's office of Federal Student Aid is statutorily mandated to do so and has the unique expertise to manage the complex student aid program.\"\n\nAFT President Randi Weingarten was more blunt: \"See you in court,\" she said in a statement after Trump signed the executive order on Thursday.\n\nProtestors participate in a \"study-in\" in front of the U.S. Department of Education, Mar. 21, 2025 in Washington Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nEven conservative policy experts such as Rick Hess, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he expects to see legal challenges because of the Higher Education Act.\n\nHess supports dismantling the department and has said the Federal Student Aid Office would be a better fit for a different agency with more of a financial background.\n\nThis comes as the Department of Education slashed nearly half its workforce recently, gutting large chunks of the Federal Student Aid Office, which handles the student loan portfolio.\n\nAt the same time, Education Secretary Linda McMahon pledged either to dismantle the agency altogether, in coordination with Congress, or reallocate its key functions to other agencies.\n\nJames Kvaal, who worked in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, told ABC News that his higher education portfolio under President Barack Obama included moving some loan functions to the Treasury Department.\n\n\"Treasury had its own authority to collect on debts, and they wanted to see if they could do a better job with student loans than the Department of Education was doing,\" Kvaal told ABC News on Friday.\n\n\"And the answer was, no, they ended up having higher costs and collecting fewer dollars for Treasury. So, you know, the pilot was abandoned,\" he added.\n\nSecretary of Education Linda McMahon attends the signing of an executive order to shut down the Department of Education by U.S. President Donald Trump, during an event in the East Room at the White House in Washington, Mar. 20, 2025.

All of which is preventable.\"",

Here's what to know\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media after attending a board meeting at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media after attending a board meeting at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media after attending a board meeting at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media after attending a board meeting at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025.\n\nIn President Donald Trump's escalating battle with the judiciary, he and his Republican allies have zeroed in on a similar message.\n\nNo single judge, they argue, should be able to use an injunction to block the powers of the country's elected chief executive.\n\n\"That's a presidential job. That's not for a local judge to be making that determination,\" Trump said on Fox News earlier this week as he railed against a judge who issued a limited order to stop deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members to other countries after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, peppered with questions after the administration did not turn the planes around, on Wednesday preemptively offered her own rebuke of judges who've recently ordered injunctions taking effect nationwide.\n\n\"The judges in this country are acting erroneously,\" she said. \"We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slow walk this administration's agenda, and it's unacceptable.\"\n\nThe White House argues that's especially the case when it comes to immigration matters, foreign affairs, national security and the president exercising his constitutional powers as commander in chief.\n\nJudges have, so far, temporarily blocked Trump's efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military, freeze federal funding and bring an end to birthright citizenship.\n\nSupporters of nationwide injunctions say they serve as an essential check to potentially unlawful conduct and prevent widespread harm. Critics say they give too much authority to individual judges and incentivize plaintiffs to try to evade random assignment and file in jurisdictions with judges who may be sympathetic to their point of view.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media after attending a board meeting at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn general, legal experts told ABC News an injunction is meant to preserve the status quo while judges consider the merits of the case. (Judges also issue temporary restraining orders -- with similar impact -- as short-term emergency measures to prevent irreparable harm until a hearing can be held.)\n\n\"Often the nationwide injunction, or universal injunction, is put in place right at the start of a litigation,\" said Amanda Frost, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.\n\n\"All of these can be appealed, and they are,\" Frost said. \"It's appealed to a three-judge court and then the Supreme Court after that. So, when people say one district court is controlling the law for the nation, well maybe for a few weeks. The system allows for appeals, and the Trump administration has appealed.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts said the same in a rare statement after Trump attacked the federal judge in the deportation flight case as a \"Radical Left Lunatic\" and called for him to be impeached.\n\nIn fact, Trump was handed a win when an appeals court last week lifted an injunction on his executive orders seeking to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the federal government.\n\nNationwide injunctions are also not new, though scholars agree they've been used far more in recent decades.\n\n\"We saw them with Obama, we saw them with the first Trump administration, and saw them with Biden,\" Frost said. \"And now we're seeing them even more with President Trump but they go in lockstep with the sweeping executive orders that seek to change and upend vast swaths of our legal structure.\"\n\nAccording to a study by the Harvard Law Review, President Barack Obama faced 12 injunctions, the Trump administration faced 64 and President Joe Biden 14 injunctions.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is shown Mar. 17, 2025, in Washington. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have either urged the judiciary to rein in injunctions or celebrated their outcomes, depending on whether they align with their political goals.\n\nIn 2023, when a federal judge in Missouri issued an injunction limiting contact between the Biden administration and social media sites, then-candidate Trump called it a \"historic ruling\" and the judge \"brilliant.\" The U.S. Supreme Court eventually sided with the Biden administration on the issue.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to curb injunctions after three different federal judges temporarily blocked the president's birthright citizenship order, saying it likely violated the 14th Amendment.\n\n\"At a minimum, the Court should stay the injunctions to the extent they prohibit agencies from developing and issuing public guidance regarding the implementation of the Order. Only this Court's intervention can prevent universal injunctions from becoming universally acceptable,\" Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in an application to the high court last week.\n\nNeama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said he understands the \"frustration\" that can stem from nationwide injunctions but ultimately \"judges are there to make sure that the government doesn't violate the Constitution.\"\n\n\"Trump is really taking a sledgehammer to everything government related,\" he said. \"These norms have been around for decades, so you have to allow some time for the courts, particularly the Supreme Court, to weigh in and say whether this is appropriate or not.\"\n\nThe White House has said Trump will comply with the courts, but his intensifying rebukes of judges and rulings have raised the question: What happens if he doesn't?\n\n\"That would completely undermine the integrity of our system,\" Rahmani said.",

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\nWASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.\n\nHours before President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.\n\nAn earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.\n\nThe result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams — some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.\n\nMore than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party’s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.\n\n“We’ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They’re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,” Booker said. “We’re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we’re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we’ve only just begun.\"\n\nBooker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year — and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.\n\nNot all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.\n\n\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.\n\nThere's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.\n\nThe Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a “Choose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.\n\nThe White House posted a video in response that read “America chose its fighters last November,” and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating “We chose our fighters a long time ago.”\n\nBut Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.\n\n“I do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral “Fighter” video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are “elitist” or “robotic.”\n\n“I didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,” Crockett added about the viral “Choose Your Fighter” video.\n\nDemocrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.\n\nSome of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.\n\n“We want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don’t have Democrats on there,” said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. “The ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that’s not typical for the Democratic base.”\n\nSome House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don’t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.\n\n“I think there’s a fine line before we’re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.\n\n“When it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing ‘get ready with me’ videos. It would look super cringe. But I’m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,” said Jacobs.\n\nSome Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it’s communicated on.\n\n“If you know how to talk to people, it doesn’t matter what medium is going to exist,” said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. “You could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don’t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn’t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it’s just not going to translate.”",

        "content": "Wyoming Republican Rep. Harriet Hageman tangled with a fiery town hall audience in her home state on Thursday night as she went back and forth with constituents over Elon Musk's DOGE and cuts to federal spending.\n\nAt one point, Hageman sparred with a woman who said she was a retired military officer and Republican, who grilled the congresswoman over the evidence of alleged fraud that Musk and Republicans contend they have uncovered.\n\n\"Just to give you a little reference, I'm a retired military officer,\" an unidentified woman said at one point in the town hall. \"At 18, I rose my hand to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. ... \"And my question, having looked at Musk's DOGE, you are a lawyer. Where is this fraud? Who? What company? What organization? What personnel are we going after right now?\"\n\nDOGE's actions have come under fire, not only for recommending thousands of federal workers be fired, including many veterans but allegations, backed by President Donald Trump and the White House pertaining to what they say is massive fraud in government spending. The claims of fraud, which Trump outlined in his recent address to Congress, are not yet verifiable.\n\nHageman, fired back at the constituent, saying, \"Oh my gosh, I'll just start reading some of it. I'll just start reading it right now, if you like me to. I'll just focus on USAID spending right here.\"\n\n\"I didn't say spending, I said actual fraud,\" the woman shouted back at Hageman.\n\n\"This is what it is,\" Hageman retorted. \"This is the spending associated with the fraud. This is the fraud. Spending is the fraud.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" the woman shouted back. \"Go after specific companies or specific personnel that are committing fraud.\"\n\nRep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., holds a town hall meeting on Friday, March 14, 2025, in Evanston, Wyo. Spenser Heaps/AP, FILE\n\n\"This is fraud. This is fraudulent spending,\" said Hageman.\n\n\"No, it may be abusive spending, but it's not fraud,\" the woman replied.\n\n\"What I said was waste, fraud and abuse. Waste, fraud and abuse,\" Hageman said back, before trying to give figures on USAID spending.\n\nThe same constituent then pressed Hageman over firings and whether or not they were actually making government more efficient: \"Just because you're firing somebody doesn't mean that's efficient because the job is still there. It still needs to be done,\" she said.\n\n\"We will eliminate some of those jobs as well,\" Hageman said. \"Those jobs will be being eliminated. They don't need to be done.\"\n\nAt another point during the town hall, another woman pressed Hageman over what qualifies Musk to be making cuts to federal spending.\n\n\"You just described the cuts to the government right now as some kind of careful audit, but the cuts that DOGE has been making have been willy-nilly by someone who has never served in the government, has never run a nonprofit, who has 19-year-olds infiltrating computers and agencies and making decisions. So who is Musk accountable to? What qualifies him to be making these cuts? It's not an audit,\" she asked.\n\nDOGE claims to have saved $115 billion but that full amount is unverifiable because there are only receipts for a portion of the claimed savings.\n\n\"As I said a moment ago, this is, it is an audit.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\"From an intelligence and law enforcement perspective, the potential for foreign intelligence forces to recruit government workers is hot,\" said John Cohen, an ABC News contributor and former acting undersecretary for intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAt the same time, state and local governments could step up to fill in their offices with that talent as President Donald Trump seeks to shift many roles and responsibilities out of the federal government.\n\n\"It would be an easy transition for them and, in the end, benefit the public, which needs their experience now,\" Victor Narro, a professor of labor studies at the Labor Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, told ABC News.\n\nWorkers ripe for the picking by private sector\n\nNarro, who has worked in Los Angeles city public boards and commissions and on a U.S. Agency for International Development project, said one of the biggest things being overlooked in DOGE's mass firings is the fact that many of these employees had strong training from top colleges and chose to have a career in public office instead of the private sector.\n\n\"A lot of public sector employees give up jobs in the private sector because they care about being a public worker,\" he said. \"They all know they could have made a lot more money and had more benefits.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Elon Musk speaks in the Oval Office at the White House, Feb. 11, 2025, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nWhat federal workers may lack in salary, they can make up in connections with policymakers and organizations, as well as access to government data and knowledge. It is common for federal workers who leave the public sector to take that knowledge to private sector jobs, such as consulting firms that specialize in the environment, national security and healthcare, Cohen said.\n\nThe unprecedented mass firing of federal workers may lead to the creation of new private sector organizations made up of those workers, Cohen said.\n\n\"It would be hard to think that those employees wouldn't be in demand,\" he said.\n\nIn fact, billionaire Mark Cuban pitched an idea in a post on March 1 that those fired workers band together and start their own consulting company.\n\n\"It's just a matter of time before DOGE needs you to fix the mess they inevitably created. They will have to hire your company as a contractor to fix it. But on your terms. I'm happy to invest and/or help,\" the Shark Tank host wrote.\n\nThere have been no public updates about Cuban's proposal since the post as of March 18.\n\nForeign national threat increased\n\nCohen said Cuban's proposal has some merit, but he warned that not everyone offering a helping hand will have altruistic intentions.\n\nIn fact, he warned offers could very well be ruses designed by foreign adversaries.\n\nCohen said counterintelligence operations throughout history have targeted disgruntled federal employees who are left in despair and with no way to pay off their expenses and debts.\n\nEach fired worker, from those at the Social Security Administration, who have knowledge about the U.S. benefits system, to nuclear engineers, could be a perfect asset to intelligence agencies in Russia, China and other nations, Cohen said.\n\nAdditionally, general knowledge about the inner workings of federal offices, personalities of top officials and other information could be appealing to adversaries, he said.\n\n\"It's not just classified information that is valuable,\" he said.\n\nFederal workers terminated by the Department of Government Efficiency organize prior to visiting Senators offices to tell their stories in the Senate Hart Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, Feb. 25, 2025. Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nCohen said Trump and Musk's belittling of the federal workers as lazy, inefficient and not useful for the government will help make it easier for foreign recruiters to make their case.\n\n\"It's a standard recruitment tool. You find that sense of grievance, you fan the flames and you get them to cooperate because they are angry at what was done to them,\" he said.\n\nThose same operations have also found success through more shady tactics, Cohen said.\n\nHe noted that there have been cases where federal employees have unknowingly worked for foreign governments posing as private U.S. companies or have been closely working with legitimate companies already operating in the U.S., clouding evidence of foreign intervention.\n\n\"It could be something as simple as offering someone to write a research paper and pay a lot for it or give a speech at a conference,\" Cohen said. \"From there, it could lead to something long term.\"\n\nGlobal health workers with USAID weep as they attend a protest in support of their fired colleagues who gathered their things inside, Feb. 28, 2025, at the USAID headquarters in Washington. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey told reporters at news conferences this week that this is playing out in her state, saying on Wednesday, \"What has happened is you have other governments, from China, from the Middle East, from around the world, coming into this country, coming into campuses in Massachusetts and basically saying, 'Hey the federal government is going to take away your funding and take away your research come to our country. We'll give you a lab. We'll set you up. We'll give you a staff. And you can pioneer the new technologies on our shores.'\"\n\n\"That's not putting America first,\" she added.\n\nTypically, the federal government prompts workers to do their due diligence and refrain from working with anyone appearing to have foreign government ties, but Cohen said it is going to be difficult to self-police this on such a massive scale.\n\n\"The government has to rely on someone's patriotism and their sense of ethics to willingly not support a foreign intelligence service. But very often, a person may not know they are being recruited,\" he said.\n\nState, local governments to the rescue?\n\nThe recruitment efforts, however, aren't limited to foreign entities and private companies. State and local governments are now seeking to fill their offices with the displaced talent.\n\nEarlier this month, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced the \"You're Hired\" campaign, which encourages fired federal workers to go to New York and apply for jobs in various state agencies. The state placed ads in Union Station that redirected them to a website with state job offerings.\n\n\"We're looking for qualified, experienced candidates across a wide variety of fields. I need technologists, I need engineers, I need attorneys, healthcare workers, educators, public policy experts and so many more,\" Hochul told reporters at a news conference on March 3.\n\nAn ad in Union Station in Washington D.C. has been trying to recruit fired federal workers Office of New York Governor, Kathy Hochul\n\n\"I'm in competition for the top attorneys, the top engineers [and] people to work at the Department of Financial Services,\" she added. \"In a place like New York City, there's a lot of higher-paying jobs. So these are special people who walk away from those jobs and those opportunities and come here, and I want to let them know that we will take care of them.\"\n\nAs of March 18, over 200 people have signed up for webinars hosted by the New York State Department of Labor, according to the governor's office.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, have started similar campaigns.\n\nNarro said it is not surprising that local governments would take the opportunity to fill their offices, given that many are now bracing for extra responsibilities following the DOGE cuts.\n\nAt the same time, there is no guarantee that those local governments can take in all of those workers, he said.\n\n\"A lot of it depends on the state. You have a better chance of getting a public job in New York versus Iowa because of the number of offices, departments and ultimately the budget,\" Narro said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk speak to the media on the South Lawn of the White House, Mar. 11, 2025, in Washington. Samuel Corum/Pool/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nCohen and Narro added that Trump's pledge to give more power to the states, particularly education, but no details on how they would get the funding to do so has also left many states in limbo when it comes to recruitment.\n\n\"It's great that the states are coming up with these programs, but if they can't commit, you're going to have more frustrated federal workers,\" Cohen said.\n\nCan the damage be undone?\n\nNarro noted that the situation with fired federal workers is still fluid as court cases play out and some of the firings have been stopped or reversed.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty alone could be devastating to the future of the federal workforce.\n\nDemonstrators rally in support of federal workers outside of the Department of Health and Human Services, Feb. 14, 2025, in Washington. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\n\"People's families depend on stability, and if they can not keep up with the changing decisions, they may just quit altogether,\" Narro said. \"I suspect this is what Trump and Musk are seeking to do in their strategy.\"\n\nNarro said that even if Trump's and Musk's policies are reversed by a future administration, there could be long-term damage.\n\n\"In the end of the day, the public loses out the most,\" he said. \"It's going to be harder for anyone to consider giving up a private job and dedicating their talents to serving the public if this is how they will be treated.\"",

(Joe Burbank /Orlando Sentinel via AP, File)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. -- A woman drowned her dog in a Florida airport bathroom and then boarded her international flight after she was prevented from bringing the white miniature schnauzer with her because of a paperwork issue, authorities said.\n\nThe woman was arrested in Lake County on Wednesday on a charge of aggravated animal abuse, a third-degree felony. She was released on $5,000 bail.\n\n“This act was intentional and resulted in a cruel and unnecessary death of the animal,” said an arrest affidavit from the Orlando Police Department.\n\nOnline court records showed no attorney listed for the woman from Kenner, Louisiana.\n\nThe investigation into the death of the 9-year-old schnauzer named Tywinn started in December when a janitor found the dog in a trash bag in a bathroom stall at Orlando International Airport.\n\nThe janitor earlier had seen the woman in the stall cleaning up water and dog food from the stall's floor. The janitor was pulled away for a cleanup emergency and returned to the bathroom 20 minutes later where she found Tywinn in the trash container, along with a companion vest, collar, rabies tag, a dog travel bag and a bone-shaped dog tag with the woman's name and phone number, investigators said.\n\nAirport surveillance cameras captured the woman speaking for 15 minutes to a Latam Airlines agent with the dog in tow, walking into a bathroom near the ticketing area with the dog and exiting the bathroom without Tywinn less than 20 minutes later. The woman then went outside the terminal building, reentered a short time later, passed through security and boarded the Colombia-bound plane, the report said.\n\nAuthorities said the woman had been told she could not bring her dog aboard because she did not have the proper paperwork. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, dogs traveling from the U.S. to Colombia must be accompanied by a veterinarian-issued health certificate and a rabies vaccination certificate.\n\nThe dog was identified by its implanted microchip and a necropsy determined that Tywinn had been drowned. U.S. Customs and Border Protection also confirmed to detectives that the woman had boarded a flight to Bogota, Colombia, and then flew to Ecuador.",

Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters\n\nAdministration lawyers took a similar position when judges ordered funding cuts from USAID and other agencies restored or for spending to be unfrozen, according to court documents.\n\n'Dangerously close'\n\nRichard Pildes, the Sudler family professor of constitutional law at NYU Law School, who has been involved in many federal court cases, told ABC News that such defiance of the courts undermines the judicial branch and could have serious consequences.\n\n\"I would say, we are dangerously close to a constitutional crisis. Maybe we're dancing kind of on the edge of a constitutional crisis,\" he told ABC News.\n\nJames Sample, a constitutional law expert at Hofstra University, who has been involved in federal cases, agreed that the country is on the \"precipice\" of such a crisis, noting that the courts are limited in being able to enforce their rulings.\n\nHowever, he noted, courts are designed to be deliberative with cases.\n\n\"The courts are essentially saying, we need to slow down,\" Sample told ABC News. \"The executive [branch] may ultimately get what it wants. … But if the executive gets what it wants without a process, then not only the individuals lose, but all of us lose justice.\"\n\nWhat constitutes a constitutional crisis?\n\nSample said constitutional scholars have differed on what exactly defines a constitutional crisis.\n\n\"The one thing we can say for certain is that it's not an on-off switch,\" Sample said of constitutional crisis. \"It's not a binary. It's a position on a spectrum.\"\n\nRetired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer echoed that sentiment in an interview with CNN this week.\n\n\"No one really knows. People have different views on that,\" he said.\n\nSample said the Trump administration's actions are sliding closer to the concerning part of the spectrum -- a development, he said, that could never have been foreseen by the nation's founders.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is shown Mar. 17, 2025 in Washington. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\n\"What we are experiencing is not a blitzkrieg against [political] adversaries, but rather a blitzkrieg on the part of the executive against the rule of law itself. That is a defining characteristic of a crisis for the rule of law,\" Sample said.\n\nPast crises were isolated\n\nAside from the Confederate states' succession leading to the Civil War, the experts ABC News spoke with said that past examples of constitutional crises ended up blowing over, such as when President Franklin D. Roosevelt threatened to go forward with a military tribunal against a Nazi sympathizer from Long Island during World War II.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ultimately gave the president the power to go forward, according to Pildes.\n\nIn some cases, the executive branch has stepped in to enforce court orders, such as when then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the National Guard to make sure states followed the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education landmark decision ending segregation in public schools.\n\nArkansas National Guard troops escort nine students from Little Rock's Central High School at the end of the day's session, Oct. 3, 1957. Bettmann Archive\n\n\"All of those [past examples] are sort of an individual, discrete issue, not a kind of more pervasive or systemic disregard of the courts and rulings of law by the executive branch,\" Pildes said.\n\nThe Trump administration's actions put courts in uncharted waters\n\nThe Trump administration's actions, in contrast, the experts said, are unprecedented because of the speed both at which the administration is enacting Trump's policies and opponents are challenging the administration's moves in court.\n\n\"The executive has some capacity to change facts on the ground before the courts can act and it can be hard to undo some of those actions, even if the courts end up concluding that they were unlawful,\" Pildes said.\n\nSample, of Hofstra, compared it to a computer being so overloaded it can't process the information.\n\n\"The volume of what is happening, and the speed at which it is being undertaken, is crashing the constitutional hard drive,\" he said.\n\nThe situation has been played out over the last couple of weeks as Trump has claimed that he would abide by court orders that issued temporary restraining orders over his policies, such as deportations, mass firings of federal workers and discharging transgender service members; however, court documents have indicated that those orders were not followed in many cases.\n\nTrump and his allies, including billionaire Elon Musk, have also gone after Judge James Boasberg on social media after he issued from the bench a temporary restraining order against the administration in a case challenging the president's executive orders to deport Venezuelan migrants.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, Feb. 26, 2025. Al Drago/Pool/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n\"We have not historically seen the idea of attacking judges [or] attacking courts for rulings with which we disagree and attacking the system itself,\" Sample said. \"That's a problem.\"\n\nTools that courts can use to push back\n\nDespite the unprecedented pushback on the courts, the experts said that the judiciary does have tools to prevent a crisis.\n\nPildes noted that while courts face a challenge when it comes to enforcing their rulings against the executive branch directly, they can still take some actions to get an administration to comply.\n\nJudges have threatened to use contempt findings and fines, and Pildes said those warnings can be serious.\n\n\"If there are lawyers involved in advising to defy a court order, or participating in defiance of a court order, there can be sanctions against those lawyers.

But if it's not, the courts can start imposing fines.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is seen in Washington, Mar. 5, 2025.

The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" he said.\n\nTrump dismissed Roberts' statement in an interview with Fox News, claiming Roberts did not directly mention him by name. Trump and his allies have continued to verbally attack federal judges who have issued temporary restraining orders and injunctions on implementation of his policies and executive orders.\n\nThe public's role is crucial in averting crises\n\nSample and Pildes said that given their actions so far during the last couple of weeks, it is unlikely that the Republican-controlled Congress will step up to curb Trump's rhetoric and action and force him to comply with the courts..However, public opinion will play a big part in preventing the country from entering a crisis, they argued.\n\n\"The tool, the arrow in the quiver of the courts is the legitimacy and the public's faith in the legitimacy of the process playing itself out of those rulings. One of the things that is a hallmark of a civilized society is that if the citizens believe that a process was fair,\" Sample said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick delivers remarks at a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Feb. 26, 2025 in Washington. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nPildes noted that as the Watergate scandal unfolded and then-President Richard Nixon was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to release audio tapes that implicated him on impeachable offenses, public opinion had already turned on him and his allies in Congress to the point that he resigned.\n\nPildes added that public opinion can be expressed through economics, which federal leaders watch attentively. Business and stock markets are typically weakened if governments and the rule of law are disrupted and that could force the executive to rethink their resistance to the courts, he said.\n\n\"If we get to [a constitutional crisis], you can imagine easily a lot of turmoil that would actually show up in the market show up in the economy. People will stop wanting to invest here,\" he said.\n\nSample said the country's current polarization will make it harder for a public consensus, but he believed that generally, Americans would be speaking out against anything that leads to a crisis.\n\nDemonstrators rally on the National Mall during the NowDC protest, in Washington, Mar. 14, 2025.

Increased funding is critical to expanding threat investigations, modernizing protective measures, and ensuring rapid response capabilities,\" Davis said. \"We must provide the men and women of the U.S. Marshals Service with the tools necessary to meet this evolving threat landscape.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts warned in his year-end report of threats to federal judges.\n\nRoberts noted more than 1,000 \"serious threats\" against federal judges investigated by the U.S. Marshals Service in the last five years, resulting in more than 50 individuals being criminally charged.\n\nHe warned of a rising tide of \"doxing\" federal judges and grassroots campaigns to bombard their offices with threatening messages. He also cited foreign misinformation efforts on social media to distort the meaning of judicial rulings.\n\n\"Public officials certainly have a right to criticize the work of the judiciary, but they should be mindful that intemperance in their statements when it comes to judges may prompt dangerous reactions by others,\" Roberts wrote.",

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)\n\nThe suburban reservoirs that supply 10% of New York City's vaunted drinking water are getting saltier due to decades of road salt being spread near the system — and they will eventually have to be abandoned if nothing is done to reverse the trend, city officials warn.\n\nThe plug wouldn't have to be pulled until early next century, according to a new study. But the soaring saltiness could eventually affect the famous taste of the Big Apple’s water, which is sometimes called the champagne of tap water, and poses a challenge to managers of a system that serves more than 9 million people.\n\n“The conclusion of this study is that if we don’t change our ways, in 2100 the Croton Water System becomes a nice recreational facility, but it ceases to be a water supply,” Rohit Aggarwala, the city’s environmental protection commissioner, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “And that will directly impact everybody who drinks New York City water.”\n\nThe Croton system dates back to 1842 — when the first Croton Aqueduct began delivering water to a reservoir in what is now Manhattan’s Central Park — and is now comprised of 12 reservoirs and three controlled lakes north of the city.\n\nThe report found the concentration of chlorides — an indicator of salinization — tripled from 1987 to 2019 in the system's main reservoir, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the city line. Concentrations are on track to exceed the state’s maximum contaminant level for chloride by 2108.\n\nThe report found salinity increases across the sprawling system of city reservoirs in upstate New York. However, the problem is far less of an issue in the Delaware and Catskill watersheds west of the Hudson River, which supply about 90% of the city’s water. That’s likely because there’s far less development in those watersheds.\n\nRoad salt is considered a main driver of the increase, along with sewage treatment plant discharges and water softeners. Millions of tons of rock salt is spread on U.S. roads each winter as a cheap and effective way to reduce accidents.\n\n“It's really a problem across the country in areas with a lot of snow,” said Shannon Roback, science director for the environmental group Riverkeeper. “We’ve seen rising levels of salt in water in the Northeast, in the Midwest and in most places that use road salt.”\n\nRoback noted that high salt levels in drinking water pose a host of environmental concerns and can be harmful to people on low-sodium diets.\n\nAggarwala said the city has a few options.\n\nSalt can be removed from water supplies through reverse osmosis systems, though the technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. The city also could mix Croton water with less salty water from its other two watersheds. But the commissioner said that would not be a solution for the more than a dozen municipalities north of New York City that draw water from the Croton system.\n\nCity officials believe reducing the use of road salt locally is the most sensible option. That could involve persuading state and local road crews to use alternatives to salt, or sensors on plows to gauge road surface temperatures, or shutting off the applicators when plows make U-turns or K turns.\n\nState Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents the area, called the new report alarming, but not surprising given a number of community wells taken offline due to high chloride levels. The Democrat is sponsoring bills that would address the road salt issue, including one that would study the issue in the Croton watershed.\n\n“State agencies, local governments, everyone needs to come together on this,” he said, “because this is a real challenge.”",

So far today there have been no road closures to and from the Florida Keys, but we continue to advise residents and commuters to stay informed and alert in case conditions change,\" Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said.\n\nABC News\n\nWhile many areas face an elevated threat for fires Saturday, parts of New Mexico and West Texas face a critical threat. Sustained winds between 15-25 mph (and higher gusts), warm temperatures and low relative humidity will contribute to the heightened threat.\n\nIn the Southeast, the greatest risk is across portions of the Carolinas and extending into northern Georgia where the Red Flag Warnings have been issued until 8 p.m. ET this evening. Winds will be gusty, but not very strong in the region. It’s the combination of very dry conditions and gusty winds elevating the fire danger in these areas.\n\nThe more critical fire danger will be focused across parts of the Plains later this afternoon into the evening hours where the winds will be stronger, and the air will be even drier. Red Flag Warnings are stretching from the Texas Panhandle up to South Dakota. The Denver metro area is under a Red Flag Warning. In these areas, wind gusts of 40-50 mph are possible in the coming hours.\n\nIt remains warm and dry in South Florida; however, light winds Saturday will give way to very calm winds in the evening so firefighters should be able to keep gaining ground.\n\nThe overall fire danger improves on Sunday, mostly due to calmer winds, but many areas will remain dry through the weekend. The fire threat will still be elevated Sunday for parts of the southern Plains, from the Texas Panhandle to western Nebraska.\n\nABC News\n\nHeavy snow and a wintry mix are expected across parts of the Upper Midwest and northern Great Lakes, where winter weather alerts are in effect for parts of northeastern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Snowfall totals ranging between 3 to 7 inches are possible, along with a light glaze of ice accumulations. However, areas farther north could expect heavier and steadier snow, leading to higher totals.\n\nHeavy rain and thunderstorms associated with the same storm system are likely farther south, where parts of the Mid-Mississippi River Valley could even encounter a few severe storms. mainly rain and thunderstorms.\n\nA good portion of Missouri and eastern Kansas, along with the northeastern corner of Oklahoma and northwestern corner of Arkansas, are under a marginal risk (level 1 of 5) for severe storms this evening and overnight. Damaging winds and the potential for large hail remains the biggest concern, but a tornado or two can’t entirely be ruled out either.\n\nThis image provided by the New Mexico State Forestry Division shows firefighters battling a wildfire in southern New Mexico, March 18, 2025. Caleb Finch/New Mexico State Forestry Division via AP\n\nAs this storm system heads farther east on Sunday, the threat for severe weather will increase across the Lower Mississippi River Valley and Deep South. Heavy rain from storms could also lead to flash flooding, especially in prone areas.\n\nOver 4 million are under a slight risk (level 2 of 5) for severe storms Sunday afternoon and evening from Texas up through Tennessee. Again, the threat for damaging winds and hail remains the biggest concern, but a few tornadoes are also possible.",

At least 40 people have been hospitalized so far, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).\n\nJust two cases have occurred in people fully vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nChildren and teenagers between ages 5 and 17 make up the majority of cases, at 130, followed by children ages 4 and under accounting for 102 cases.\n\nA sign is seen outside a clinic with the South Plains Public Health District, on Feb. 23, 2025, in Brownfield, Texas. Julio Cortez/AP, FILE\n\nThere have been two U.S. deaths linked to measles this year, with one confirmed and one under investigation.\n\nThe confirmed death was an unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas. The child did not have any known underlying conditions, according to DSHS.\n\nThe death was the first U.S. measles death recorded in a decade, according to data from the CDC.\n\nA possible second measles death was recorded after an unvaccinated New Mexico resident tested positive for the virus following their death. The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) said the official cause of death is still under investigation.\n\nNew Mexico has reported a total of 38 measles cases so far this year, according to the NMDOH. Many of the cases have been confirmed in Lea County, which borders western Texas.\n\nHealth officials suspect there may be a connection between the Texas and New Mexico cases but a link has not been confirmed.\n\nThe CDC has confirmed 378 measles cases this year in at least 17 states: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont and Washington. This is likely an undercount due to delays in states reporting cases to the federal health agency.\n\nThe majority of nationally confirmed cases, some 95%, are in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown, the CDC said. Of those cases, 3% are among those who received just one dose of the MMR inoculation and 2% are among those who received the required two doses, according to the CDC.\n\nA vial of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is on display at the Lubbock Health Department, on Feb. 26, 2025, in Lubbock, Texas. Mary Conlon/AP\n\nThe CDC recommends that people receive two doses of the MMR vaccine, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second dose between 4 and 6 years of age.\n\nOne dose is 93% effective and two doses are 97% effective in preventing measles, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster, per the health agency.\n\nIn the face of the growing measles outbreak, the CDC issued an alert on March 7, saying that parents in the outbreak area should consider getting their children their first MMR vaccine between ages 6 and 11 months, followed by the previously recommended scheduled doses at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old, for a total of three vaccinations. Texas health officials have also recommended early vaccination for infants living in outbreak areas.\n\nABC News' Youri Benadjaoud and Sony Salzman contributed to this report.",

Michael Tran/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBorn Jan. 10, 1949, Foreman was the fifth of seven children and grew up \"in the toughest neighborhood in Houston,\" he wrote in his book \"George Foreman's Guide To Life: How to Get Up Off the Canvas When Life Knocks You Down,\" which was published in 2003. \"I didn't have a lot to look forward to in life. At least I didn't think I did. I was hungry all the time; I dropped out of school in the eighth grade; I relied on my size and my fists to make my way.\"\n\nAt the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, Foreman, then 19, had already developed what ESPN would go on to call his \"wrecking ball fists,\" and defeated Soviet opponent Jonas Cepulis. The referee had to stop the fight before the end of the second round.\n\nForeman won his first heavyweight title at just 24 with a stunning knockout of the then-undefeated world champion Joe Frazier in 1973.\n\nBilled as The Rumble in the Jungle, Foreman’s most famous fight ended in his first professional loss to Muhammad Ali in October 1974. He surrendered the heavyweight title in the knockout loss.\n\nBut he would regain the belt after a 10-year retirement in a fight in 1994 against Michael Moorer at 45 years old.\n\nGeorge Foreman demonstrates his grill range in aid of The British Heart Foundation at Trafalgar Square in London, Oct. 20, 2006.

Everyone in life goes through a hard time sometime, but you can't let that define who you are,\" he wrote in his 2003 book. \"What defines you is how you come back from those troubles and what you find in life to smile about.\"",

(Photo by Matt Burkhartt/Getty Images)\n\nA Cornell University graduate student filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's executive orders aimed at going after universities and \"foreign national\" protesters, then he was asked to surrender to ICE.\n\nMomodou Taal, a Ph.D. student in Africana Studies at Cornell University, filed the suit on Saturday hoping to prevent the administration from targeting him and others who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests. An attorney for Taal said he had been targeted by some of the same groups that had advocated for Mahmoud Khalil's arrest and that his client feared he could be next.\n\nTaal is a citizen of the U.K. and Gambia and is in the United States on a student visa.\n\nAccording to court records, Taal was temporarily suspended from Cornell in April and September of 2024 for his participation in student protests. Instead of imposing sanctions that could have affected his immigration status, the university chose to allow Taal to continue studying remotely until Spring 2025 when his full access to the campus would be restored, his lawyers said.\n\nIn an X post on Wednesday, Taal said law enforcement agents \"from an unidentified agency\" had been seen parked outside his home in Ithaca, New York.\n\n\"Trump is attempting to detain me to prevent me from having my day in court,\" he wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, attorney Eric Lee filed an affidavit, stating, \"It appears the government is attempting to detain Mr. Taal imminently.\" Witnesses had seen an undercover law enforcement official parked outside Taal's home, his attorney said. The man allegedly showed the witnesses a badge \"indicating he is a member of law enforcement.\"\n\nTaal's attorneys petitioned for a temporary restraining order seeking to prevent his arrest.\n\nHowever, on Friday, his attorneys said they received an e-mail from a Justice Department lawyer asking Taal to turn himself in to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"ICE invites Mr. Taal and his counsel to appear in-person at the HSI Office in Syracuse at a mutually agreeable time for personal service of the NTA and for Mr. Taal to surrender to ICE custody. Accordingly, if you are interested in proposing such a date and time, we will promptly forward it to ICE for consideration,\" the email read.\n\nOn Friday, Lee posted on X and condemned the Trump administration's move.\n\n\"The Trump administration responded to Momodou Taal's lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the executive orders by sending agents to stake out his house, he said. When we asked the Court to enjoin the administration from detaining Mr. Taal as the case progresses, the administration responded by ordering him to surrender to ICE. This does not happen in a democracy.\"\n\nA hearing has been set for Tuesday.\n\nABC News has reached out to ICE for comment.",

They attribute the gains, in part, to the fact that “Americans are ready to stand up and fight back against the Trump administration’s overwhelmingly unpopular agenda.” In February 2016, following the first full month of Trump’s previous term, the party recorded pulling in less than $5 million in grassroots fundraising.\n\nThe haul also comes amid Ken Martin’s first month as party chair. The DNC cites the Minnesota Democrat’s leadership as another reason they saw a boost in grassroots support. Top-performing fundraising emails, texts and peer-to-peer messages were signed by Martin in the month since his election on Feb. 1, the memo says.\n\nBut the fundraising increase comes as the Democratic Party grapples with low approval ratings and intraparty fighting around their overall direction and response to the Trump administration’s policies.\n\nA few recent polls indicate that the general public does not see any one person as leading the Democratic Party. One, from CNN/SSRS published on Sunday, found no consensus among American adults over which Democratic leader “best reflects the core values of the Democratic Party,” while also showing that the Democratic Party’s favorability rating among Americans stands at a record low.\n\nJust last week, a contentious battle brewed on Capitol Hill over whether to pass a GOP-approved government funding bill, hurled the party into discussions over their strategy and about potential changes in their leadership ranks.\n\nThe DNC, however, has recently made plays to carve out its own lane among the larger party as a leading voice in response to Trump and Republicans.\n\nIn the wake of the National Republican Congressional Committee’s recent calls for GOP House members to pull back on hosting in-person town hall events while constituents have become heated about DOGE’s cuts to the federal workforce, the DNC started pairing with other organizations and state parties across the country to host “People’s Town Halls” in competitive districts with vulnerable GOP House incumbents.\n\nAnother bright spot for Democrats in February, according to DNC fundraising data set to be publicly filed with the Federal Elections Commission later Thursday, is that this month marked the DNC’s best fundraising month via digital ads in an off-year, with more than $1 million raised.\n\n“We expect significant return on investment by the 2026 midterms,” the DNC said in the memo.\n\nThe DNC is prioritizing “balancing high-performing fundraising formats” with “new content that educates donors and invites them to volunteer or give the DNC feedback to better understand their priorities in our fight against Donald Trump,” according to the memo.",

        "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
        "content": "Abortion has been top of mind for many voters casting early ballots in the race for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court\n\nMILWAUKEE -- As the candidates for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat squared off in a recent debate before early voting, one issue came up first and dominated at the start.\n\n“Let’s talk about abortion rights,” the moderator said.\n\nThe winner of the April 1 election could hold the power to determine the fate of any future litigation over abortion because the outcome of the race for a vacancy on the state's highest court will decide whether liberals or conservatives hold a majority.\n\nAbortion has become a central plank of the platform for the Democratic-backed candidate, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, in part because of its effect on voter turnout, although to a lesser extent than during a heated 2023 state Supreme Court race that flipped the court to a liberal majority. Brad Schimel, a former state attorney general, is the Republican-supported candidate.\n\n“Abortion of course remains a top issue,” said Charles Franklin, a Marquette University political scientist. “But we haven’t seen either candidate be as outspoken on hot-button issues as we saw in 2023.”\n\nDemocrats are hoping voters will be motivated by the potential revival of an abortion ban from 1849, which criminalizes “the willful killing of an unborn quick child.” The Wisconsin Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to reactivate the 175-year-old ban.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the court to rule on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state.\n\nThe 19th century law was enacted just a year after Wisconsin became a state, when lead mining and the lumber industry formed the bedrock of the state’s economy as white settlers rushed into areas left vacant by forced removals of Native American tribes.\n\nIt also was a time when combinations of herbs stimulating uterine contractions were the most common abortion method, said Kimberly Reilly, a history and gender studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.\n\n“During this time, there were no women in statehouses,” Reilly said. “When a woman got married, she lost her legal identity. Her husband became her legal representative. She couldn’t own property in her name. She couldn’t make a contract.”\n\nThis is the latest instance of long-dormant restrictions influencing current abortion policies after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, which had granted a federal right to abortion.\n\nThe revival of an 1864 Arizona abortion law, enacted when Arizona was a territory, sparked a national outcry last year. Century-old abortion restrictions passed by all-male legislatures during periods when women could not vote — and scientific knowledge of pregnancy and abortion were limited — have also influenced post-Roe abortion policies in Alabama, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia.\n\nThose laws tend to be more severe. They often do not include exceptions for rape and incest, call for the imprisonment of providers and ban the procedure in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Some have since been repealed, while others are being challenged in court.\n\nDuring the state Supreme Court debate March 12, Crawford declined to weigh in directly on the 1849 abortion case but promoted her experience representing Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and “making sure that women could make their own choices about their bodies and their health care.” In an ad released Wednesday, she accused Schimel of not trusting “women to make their own healthcare decisions.”\n\nSchimel calls himself “pro-life” and has previously supported leaving Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion ban on the books. He dodged questions about abortion during the debate, saying he believes the issue should be left up to voters, although Wisconsin does not have a citizen-led ballot initiative process, which voters in several other states have used to protect abortion rights.\n\nAnthony Chergosky, a University of Wisconsin-La Crosse political scientist, said Schimel has been “borrowing from the Republican playbook of avoiding the issue of abortion” by leaving the question to voters in individual states.\n\nThe message has still gotten across to many Democratic voters, who cited abortion as a top issue while waiting in line for early voting this past week.\n\nJane Delzer, a 75-year-old liberal voter in Waukesha, said “a woman’s right to choose is my biggest motivator. I’m deeply worried about what Schimel may do on abortion.”\n\nJune Behrens, a 79-year-old retired teacher, spoke about a loved one’s abortion experience: “Everyone makes their own choice and has their own journey in life, and they deserve that right.”\n\nRepublican voters primarily cited immigration and the economy as their top issues, essentially the same ones that helped propel Republican Donald Trump's win over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris last November in the presidential election. But others said they also wanted conservative social views reflected on the court.\n\nLewis Titus, a 72-year-old volunteer for the city of Eau Claire, said restricting abortion was his top issue in the Supreme Court race: \"I believe that Brad Schimel is the one to carry that on.”\n\nWhile it's one of the key issues this year, abortion played a much larger role two years ago, when a race for Wisconsin’s highest court demonstrated how expensive and nationalized state Supreme Court races have become.\n\nThis year’s campaigns have focused primarily on “criminal sentencing and attempting to paint one another as soft on crime,” said Howard Schweber, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor emeritus.\n\nCrawford also has tried to make the race a referendum on Trump after his first months in office and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is running Trump’s massive federal cost-cutting initiative and has funded two groups that have together spent more than $10 million to promote Schimel.\n\n“Two years ago, abortion was a hugely mobilizing issue, and we saw that clearly in the lead-up to the election,” Schweber said. “We’re seeing some of this but not to the same extent, which really makes no sense. The issues and stakes are exactly the same.”\n\nThe decision to elevate other issues might be the result of anxiety among Democrats that abortion may not resonate as deeply as they once believed after significant election losses in November, despite Harris using abortion as a pillar of her campaign, several Wisconsin politics experts said.\n\nCharles Franklin, a Marquette University political scientist, said he believes abortion will motivate Democrats, but the issue may not rank high in the priorities of independent voters, who he says will be central to the race's outcome.\n\n“In the early days after Roe v. Wade was overturned, it was still a very hot issue for voters,” he said. “But as states have codified their abortion laws, the issue doesn’t seem to motivate voters to the same extent. In the fall, many Democrats believed abortion was still this magic silver bullet and would win them the presidential and Senate races. But the outcomes didn’t seem to support that.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Mark Vancleave in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!\"\n\nHe also suggested those found guilty of participating in Tesla-related crimes could be sent to prison in El Salvador, referring to the administration's controversial move to deport alleged gang members to the country after Trump signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act even though a court order temporarily blocked the authority.\n\nA member of the Seattle Fire Department inspects a burned Tesla Cybertruck at a Tesla lot in Seattle, Mar. 10, 2025.

You didn't have anything like that on Jan. 6, which is sort of amazing,\" Trump said.\n\nThree people have been charged for their alleged involvement in recent attacks against Tesla properties in Salem, Oregon; Loveland, Colorado; and North Charleston, South Carolina. Adam Lansky of Salem was charged with illegally possessing an unregistered destructive device on March 5, Lucy Grace Nelson of Lyons, Colorado, was charged with one count of malicious destruction of property on Feb. 27 and Daniel Clarke-Pounder of North Charleston was charged with arson on March 15, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nBoth Lansky and Clarke-Pounder have not entered any pleas, but Nelson pleaded not guilty on March 11, according to court records.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi also spoke out against the Tesla vandalisms, saying on Thursday the three suspects will face the \"full force of the law\" for allegedly using Molotov cocktails to set fire to the electric vehicles and charging stations.\n\n\"The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,\" Bondi said in a statement. \"Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\"\n\nMore Tesla incidents continue to pop up across the country, with the latest occurring in Fargo, North Dakota, early Friday morning, where fire crews found \"a small fire in wood chips at the base of the electric vehicle chargers in the parking lot,\" according to the Fargo Fire Department.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, accompanied by White House Senior Advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, speaks next to a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House, Mar. 11, 2025 in Washington. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nOfficials said the fire is considered \"suspicious\" and the cause of the fire is under investigation. It is unclear whether the fire damaged the chargers, authorities said.\n\nThe New York City Police Department is also asking for the public's help in identifying two men who spray-painted a swastika on a Cyber Truck on Thursday. The incident is being investigated by the NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force.\n\nIn addition to the company dealing with the recent attacks, Tesla's stocks have tumbled nearly 48% this year and in recent weeks, four top officers at the company have sold off $100 million in stock, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMusk, the owner of X, reposted reactions to Trump's comments on Friday, including one that said \"ESPECIALLY the funders\" should be held responsible for these attacks.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.",

        "content": "Alleged members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua who were deported by the U.S. government, are detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador in a photo obtained Mar. 16, 2025.\n\nAlleged members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua who were deported by the U.S. government, are detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador in a photo obtained Mar. 16, 2025.\n\nAlleged members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua who were deported by the U.S. government, are detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador in a photo obtained Mar. 16, 2025.\n\nAlleged members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua who were deported by the U.S. government, are detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador in a photo obtained Mar. 16, 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport more than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members is an \"incredibly troublesome and problematic\" application of the centuries-old wartime law, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said during a court hearing Friday, in his strongest rebuke to date of the Trump administration's deportation actions.\n\nTrump last Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act -- a wartime authority used to deport noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- by arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a \"hybrid criminal state\" that is invading the U.S.\n\n\"I agree the policy ramifications of this are incredibly troublesome and problematic and concerning, and I agree it's an unprecedented and expanded use of an act that has been used ... in the War of 1812, World War I and World War II, when there was no question there was a declaration of war and who the enemy was,\" Boasberg said at Friday's hearing.\n\nThe judge noted that the Trump administration's arguments about the extent of the president's powers are \"awfully frightening\" and a \"long way from\" the intent of the law.\n\nHe also vowed to hold the Trump administration accountable, if necessary, if they violated his court order last weekend blocking the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport the Venezuelan migrants.\n\n\"The government's not being terribly cooperative at this point, but I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my order and who ordered this and what's the consequence,\" he said.\n\nWhen Boasberg asked if the DOJ could vow that the Trump administration would hold individual hearings before they deport anyone under the AEA to confirm they are members of Tren de Aragua, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign declined to make that commitment.\n\nAlleged members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua who were deported by the U.S. government, are detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador in a photo obtained Mar. 16, 2025. Secretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia via AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"No, Your Honor, I don't have authorization to do that,\" he said.\n\nBoasberg concluded the hearing without issuing any ruling from the bench.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, the judge probed the timing and motive behind the Trump administration's \"rushed\" deportations last weekend, which took place despite Boasberg ordering that they turn around two flights the administration said were deporting alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador. Officials failed to turn the flights around, saying they were already in international waters by the time they got the order, according to sources.\n\nEnsign confirmed to Boasberg during Friday's hearing that he understood the judge's 6:45 p.m. oral directive to turn both flights around and conveyed that to immigration authorities, seemingly undermining arguments made by the Justice Department earlier this week about the timing of the order.\n\n\"Can I ask you now how you interpreted that statement when we had a conversation on Saturday?\" Judge Boasberg asked. \"Did you not understand my statement during that hearing?\"\n\n\"I understood your statements and relayed your directive to the clients, which I have done,\" Ensign said.\n\n\"What did you understand? Did you think that that was hypothetical, not serious, that it was going to be modified? Or did you understand that when I said do that immediately?\" Judge Boasberg asked.\n\n\"I understood your intent -- that you meant that to be effective at that time,\" Ensign said, appearing to undermine the DOJ's arguments.\n\nJudge Boasberg also questioned the timing of Trump's proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act, suggesting it was \"signed in the dark\" to rush the deportations before someone could bring a legal challenge.\n\n\"Why is this proclamation essentially signed in the dark on Friday night, early Saturday morning, when people rushed on the plane?\" Judge Boasberg asked. \"To me, the only reason to do that is if you know the problem and you want to get them out of the country before a suit is filed.\"\n\n\"I don't have knowledge of those operational details,\" Ensign said.\n\nThe judge also raised concerns that the rushed deportations prevented the men from being able to challenge the allegation they belonged to Tren de Aragua.\n\n\"The question ... is whether the government can summarily deport people without any individualized assessment of whether they actually fall into the category of the proclamation,\" Boasberg said. \"What happens if someone is not a member of TdA or not a Venezuelan citizen or not a lawful permanent resident? How do they challenge their removal?\"\n\nEnsign said individuals could challenge the label with a habeas petition.\n\n\"Your honor, I think the SDNY decision in the Watkins case suggests that review is available under habeas for those individualized determinations,\" he said. \"So that court recognized that you couldn't bring facial challenges to the sufficiency of the president's determinations under the proclamation, the individualized applications of them may be reviewable in habeas.\"\n\nAn attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that individuals targeted by the AEA should be able to contest whether they fall within the act.\n\n\"Otherwise, anybody could be taken off the street and removed,\" Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney, said. \"This is a very dangerous road we're going down.\"\n\nGelernt said there would have to be some type of judicial review for individuals to be removed under the proclamation, adding it should be a meaningful process for individuals \"to understand and contest\" the claims against them.\n\nWith Ensign appearing to undermine arguments made earlier this week about the timing of the order -- and continuing to struggle to answer Judge Boasberg's questions -- the judge suggested that the DOJ might be risking its reputation and credibility with its recent conduct.\n\n\"I often tell my clerks before they go out into the world to practice law, the most valuable treasure they possess is their reputation and their credibility,\" Boasberg said. \"I just ask you make sure your team [understands] that lesson.\"\n\nTrump is the first president since World War II to use the Alien Enemies Act and the first president to use it against a non-state actor.\n\nAn official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acknowledged in a sworn declaration earlier this week that \"many\" of the noncitizens deported last wekend under the Alien Enemies Act did not have criminal records in the United States.\n\nTrump, asked by ABC News' Karen Travers Friday during an Oval Office press availability if he believes he has the authority to round up people and deport them without having to show the evidence against them, replied, \"That's what the law says, and that's what our country needs.\"\n\n\"You can't take that away from the people that are responsible,\" Trump said. \"And you can't stop that with a judge sitting behind a bench that has no idea what goes on.\"\n\n\"They're bad people,\" Trump said of the alleged gang members while criticizing the Biden administration's border policy. \"We don't want them in our country. We can't let a judge say that he wants them. You know, he didn't run for president. ... I won on the basis of getting criminals out of our country.\"\n\nFriday's hearing comes as cabinet-level officials in the Trump administration are considering invoking the state secrets privilege to prevent the disclosure of information about last week's deportations, according to sworn filing from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.\n\nThe Trump administration has until March 25 to confirm whether they are invoking state secrets privilege to prevent the disclosure of information about the deportation flights based on national security concerns.\n\nElizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice, said the Trump administration's potential use of state secrets privilege could revive a decades-old conflict about the judicial branch's role in national security issues.\n\nAlleged members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua who were deported by the U.S. government, are detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador in a photo obtained Mar. 16, 2025. Secretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia via AFP via Getty Images\n\nIf Judge Boasberg accepts the Trump administration's argument that providing more information about the deportations risks national security, it could move swaths of evidence off the table and potentially sideline legal cases related to the removals, Goitein said.\n\nBut the Trump administration has to prove the risk to Boasberg, who will make the decision about whether the privilege is applicable.\n\n\"The president cannot simply say the words 'national security' and shut down the courts when it comes to their review of things like deportations under the Alien Enemies Act,\" Goitein told ABC News.\n\nTo demonstrate that the privilege should apply, the head of the agency that holds the relevant information needs to submit evidence or sworn declarations proving that the public disclosure of information would risk national security.\n\n\"It's really up to the judge,\" Goitein said. \"The judge will look at whatever declarations or affidavits are filed by the government and will determine whether, on their face, these documents establish that the state secrets privilege applies to the information.\"\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has so far argued that not even Judge Boasberg has the right to know more about the deportations. In filings and court hearings this week, DOJ lawyers have argued that the issue exceeds Boasberg's jurisdiction -- even though federal judges have the authority to review classified information in closed settings, according to Goitein.\n\nIf the Trump administration continues to stonewall the judge, they're unlikely to properly invoke the privilege to prevent the public disclosure of the records, according to Goitein.\n\n\"It seems like the government is asserting, already, from the get-go, that the court should not have this information, regardless of whether it ever gets to the litigants or whether it ever becomes public. That is not a valid assertion,\" she said.\n\nGoitein noted that the lawsuit over the deportations can proceed while Judge Boasberg takes up the state secrets arguments, and the case may be able to continue even if the privilege is permitted by the judge. The use of state secrets privilege would wall off certain evidence and materials -- some of which might be necessary to prove the Trump administration potentially defied the court's order -- but the overall case about the legitimacy of the deportations may be able to continue, she said.\n\n\"This information that the judge has requested is less about the lawsuit that the plaintiffs filed ... and more about whether or not the government complied with the court's order to stop any deportations,\" she said.",

President Donald Trump has an affinity for Diet Coke—yes, you read that right—and it’s an affinity that’s so strong he built a damn button on the Oval Office desk to notify White House staffers to fill his cup up.\n\nNow, this is technically not a new thing. When he first took office in 2017 through 2021, he installed a red button—I’m imagining it looks like the ‘That Was Easy’ Staples’ button—on the desk. With him returning to the office this week, he didn’t waste any time in bringing the button back. The Wall Street Journal confirmed that the contraption was quickly set up in the office Monday, meaning it was a part of his extensive Day 1 activities in the office.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAgain, I have to say you have to appreciate someone so committed to what they love. Now I’m just wondering to myself what I would install a button for. One for Michelob Ultra refills? Or a button that brings me soft pretzels whenever my heart desires? The opportunities are endless.\n\nDonald Trump’s Diet Coke Button is Back in Washington\n\nThe Coca-Cola company is well aware of Trump’s fandom of its beverages. They even gave him a commemorative bottle recently with an old-school soda bottle and a White House label on it that listed his Jan. 20 Inauguration Day. It was presented to him by the company’s CEO, James Quince.\n\nDuring his first term, the New York Times revealed just how obsessed he is with Diet Coke. Trump reportedly drinks 12 cans a day. There’s no way that’s healthy, right? I drink one of them, and I instantly hate myself for consuming the sugary drink.\n\nMore power to you, Trump. By this point, his body has gotta be comprised of 75% Diet Coke flowing through him.",

Yasuke is a Black character in a AAA game — Anno Domini 2025. With such a major spotlight on Assassin’s Creed Shadows, it’s led many players and/or viewers to look upon this egregious crime with the expected responses.\n\nFightinCowboy, however, seems to have been fed up with the negativity. In a now-viral clip, he strikes back against people who are anti-Yasuke.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nPerhaps the Gamers are alright — Lucas (@phoenixfire.bsky.social) 2025-03-20T06:44:46.867Z\n\nThe above clip indeed contains some rather colorful language as FightinCowboy lets loose. Now, here’s what I’ll tell y’all right off the rip. I know better than to invite my own brand of tiresome comments for certain reasons. So, I don’t particularly feel obligated to vocalize my opinion on the Assassin’s Creed Shadows “controversy” either way. People don’t like Yasuke for certain reasons, they articulated that, FightinCowboy didn’t take too kindly to it.\n\nScreenshot: Ubisoft\n\nit’s a bird, it’s a plane — it’s an ‘assassin’s creed shadows’ conversation i want no part of\n\nFor VICE’s part in anything Assassin’s Creed Shadows, what I do feel like saying is that Shaun loved it! “I hope Ubisoft takes a lesson from its own playbook when addressing the future of its franchises. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the perfect example. Mending the broken pieces together can make a work of art. But if those pieces continue to break and shatter, they may find themselves unable to fix what has been previously broken. And like any piece of art, this is a delicate and fragile thing. But from a distance, up close, and hands-on, its beauty shines through.” Yeah, Shaun was pretty poetic with his praise of the game!\n\nAs for you, FightinCowboy, unfortunately, I can’t say whether what you said was good or bad — that’s not my job. All I know is this: Assassin’s Creed Shadows is indeed part of a conversation in the world of gaming. Ubisoft seems to be enjoying itself if sales numbers are anything to go by so far, though. I’m not one to comment on that, either.",

        "content": "If you’re old enough to remember the DARE program, you probably remember the litany of unhinged rhetoric they used to try and convince you that smoking cannabis was not a good time and does not make you a cool dude. Among those was the claim that over time, cannabis makes you dumber and permanently damages your long term memory. Well, we can (maybe) put that one to bed along with the whole “gateway drug” thing. Because according to a study out of Denmark, cannabis users might actually experience less cognitive decline than non-cannabis users as they age.\n\nConscripted In Copenhagen\n\nA little background first: Ever since 1849, Denmark has required physically fit men over 18 years of age to be conscripted for 4-12 months of military service. On the way into this service, conscripts are given a cognitive test. That’s where the authors of this new study saw an opportunity. The test was re-administered to 5,162 men who were now around 64 years old, and then polled those men to see if they’d ever tried or habitually consumed cannabis.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe men who were habitual consumers of the devil’s lettuce actually scored higher on the cognitive test than those who didn’t, showing less overall cognitive decline over the around 44 year period between the first time they took the cognitive test and the re-test for this study. There are a lot of other factors that could play a role in these results, like lifestyle, income, and consumption of other intoxicants over time. But even accounting for those, the researchers still saw a slight uptick in cognitive function among the old stoner crowd.\n\nNot so fast, Grandpa\n\nThere’s a caveat, though. The margin is slim: cannabis consumers scored on average 1.3 points higher than non-cannabis users. Even the authors of the study say that much more research is needed before any medical conclusions can be drawn. Still, it’s an interesting result that flies in the face of conventional wisdom about cannabis. So don’t go getting your grandpa a bag of weed and a bong for Christmas just yet. Or do, just don’t expect that it’ll make him any better at, well, anything besides eating and saying inappropriate things at the dinner table.",

As it stands, it seems like everything’s above board barring further developments.\n\nUpdate (3/22/2025): The eternal racing dream seems to be a nightmare — allegedly, there’s a good reason to believe that no Rigs will become Big after all. RIP, you beautiful bastard. (How could you betray us, Steam?)\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nHate to be the bearer of bad news, but apparently that new listing of Big Rigs on Steam is completely bogus; searching for the publisher, \"Margarite Entertainment\" (not GameMill) only brings up said Steam listing, the header is stolen from SteamGridDB, & the client icon appears to be AI-generated. — 🃏Clip🃏 (@clipthejester.bsky.social) 2025-03-22T18:31:48.888Z\n\nOriginal: Have you ever had the perfect thing happen to you? Something that seems so uniquely wonderful, that, for a second, it feels like you personally led to its manifestation? Well, with Steam further deciding to host one of the most racing games of all time, it’s my lucky day. And, dear reader? It’s your lucky day, too! So, in Q2 of 2025, the world shall once again receive Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. No, it’s not April 1. I’m not kidding. This isn’t an elaborate joke.\n\nIndeed, straight from Steam itself: “Get ready for some brake jamm’in, CB talk’in, convey roll’in action across America! From Portland Oregon to Miami Florida, you’ll be hauling loads and trying to then stay one step ahead of the law as you climb into your Big Rig for non-stop racing and driving action.” Oh. Hell. YEAH. Tamin’ roads and haulin’ loads, baby!\n\nI usually don’t throw the Features section into an article, but y’all need to see this. You know what Steam says we have to look forward to with Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing‘s return, though?\n\nFEATURES:\n\n🚛 4 BIG RIG trucks with trailers\n\n🛣️ 4 unique routes: Desert, Forest, Plains, and Cities\n\n🌅 Day & Night driving—a real challenge for even the most experienced truckers\n\n🛤️ Various maps of highways and byways across America\n\n🚔 3 intense levels with a variety of wicked racing challenges\n\nThat’s explicitly copied and pasted from Steam itself. No, I didn’t put those emojis there.\n\nScreenshot: Margarite Entertainment\n\nplease let us do ‘Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing’ multiplayer, steam. i beg of you.\n\n“This wasn’t on Steam already? With how much of a meme this game is, I thought it would have been,” one ResetEra member says of this announcement. How dare you! Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing is not a “meme game.” There was a time when Big Rigs was on the level with Gran Turismo and Forza. Also, Steam’s about to make beaucoup bucks selling such a storied piece of art.\n\nThree. Intense. Levels. I just… at a point, it’s hard to even know what to write. I’ve articulated that, at best, the only racing games I like are super gimmicky/party ones. But, for Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing? Indeed, I might be able to fall in love with simulation racing games. Thank you, Steam. Overall, you’ve truly filled our cups on this most marvelous of weekends!",

Trump and his company have already been found liable, and are now just waiting to find out the size of the punishment. That decision could land at any moment, zapping Trump’s business like a thunderbolt when it does, in what could easily be the largest financial penalty of Trump’s life.\n\nThe New York Attorney General’s Office is seeking $370 million, along with a lifetime ban on Trump working in New York real estate or serving as an executive or director of a company based in the state. Judge Engoron declared Trump and his business liable for fraudulently overstating Trump’s wealth for financial gain in September. Now, the same judge bears sole responsibility for setting the penalty. A spokesperson for the court said Thursday that the ruling has been delayed until early to mid-February.\n\nA $370 million fine would follow Trump’s $83 million defamation loss to writer E. Jean Carroll, in a lawsuit over Trump’s derisive denials of Carroll’s claim that Trump raped her in a New York department store bathroom in the 1990s.\n\nSuch mammoth judgements dwarf notable courtroom defeats Trump has faced in the past.\n\nTrump’s company was fined only $1.6 million when it was found criminally liable in late 2022 for paying executives in off-the-books perks in what prosecutors branded an illegal scheme to minimize taxes.\n\nWhen Trump settled three lawsuits brought against his Trump University real estate training program in November 2016, right after he was elected president, he paid out a total of $25 million. In that instance, the NY Attorney General’s office had accused the operation of fraud, saying the unaccredited, for-profit venture misled its customers by calling the business a “university.”\n\nThe New York AG also had a hand in shutting down the Donald J. Trump Foundation, the personal charity Trump founded in 1987, through a lawsuit that forced the operation to dissolve in 2018. The office accused the charity of engaging in “persistently illegal conduct,” and said Trump used the foundation for his personal and political benefit. Yet when the foundation was shuttered, it was only forced to pay out less than $4 million to eight different charities.\n\nThis time, the stakes are much higher.\n\nThe potential combined $450 million in damages from both the New York fraud lawsuit and the Carroll case would equal roughly 15 percent of Trump’s $3.1 billion fortune, as estimated by Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nTrump himself has boasted that his net worth amounts to some $10 billion or more, but independent experts generally assess his real fortune to be only a fraction of that amount, although still likely in the billions.\n\nTrump claimed last year that his cash stockpiles are “substantially in excess” of $400 million. He may in fact have $600 million in cash, according to Bloomberg estimates.\n\nTrump’s company is notoriously opaque, meaning that it’s hard to know exactly how much damage losing $450 million would inflict. Most of Trump’s known wealth is held in the form of real estate, including Trump Tower and residential and commercial buildings in Manhattan; golf courses around the country; the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; and his Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, NY.\n\nTrump has often boasted about the amount of cash he keeps lying around.\n\n“We have a lot of cash,” Trump said in a deposition with New York attorney general’s office lawyers in April 2023. “I believe we have substantially in excess of $400 million in cash, which is a lot for a developer. Developers usually don’t have cash. They have assets, not cash. We have, I believe, $400-plus [million] and going up very substantially every month.”\n\nTrump won’t have to pay the full amount for either penalty immediately, and hopes to appeal both losses. But the amount will grow while he appeals, rising by 9 percent annually, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump spent approximately $50 million in donor money on legal bills and investigation-related expenses in 2023, The New York Times reported on Wednesday. All told, Trump’s various legal committees spent roughly $210 million in 2023, while raising only $200 million, according to Politico. In other words, Trump’s legal fees are draining resources from his political operation, which spent more last year than it took in despite Trump’s incessant fundraising.\n\nThen there’s the question of whether, once this case and its appeals are all wrapped up, Trump’s family business will even be allowed to continue to exist in its current state.\n\nIn September, Judge Engoron caused a stir when, upon finding that Trump had committed fraud, he ordered the revocation of many state certificates Trump needs to run his companies. The judge said that the companies, which hold many of Trump’s assets including Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, should be turned over to a receiver for “dissolution.”\n\nWhen asked whether he meant that Trump’s buildings should be sold off, Judge Engoron demurred, saying he’d clarify his precise meaning later. That September order is now under appeal.\n\nYet so far Trump has lodged several other appeals related to the fraud case, including an attempt to remove James from the case, dismiss the suit completely and block multiple subpoenas.\n\nAlmost all of those efforts have failed.",

        "content": "A California prison is being placed under a microscope following a possible death by mail. The incident in question involves fentanyl-laced pages that may have killed a mailroom supervisor.\n\nAt the high-security US Penitentiary in Atwater, an inmate named Jamar Jones was allegedly sent mail from his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Ferreira and a man called Jersey Rudd III. Prosecutors say that multiple pages of the letter were “soaked” in drugs—including amphetamines, fentanyl, and “spice,” or synthetic cannabinoids, according to drug testing. They say the paper looked like it was dipped in wax.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe senders attempted to conceal the alleged drug shipment by sending it via “legal mail,” meant to be confidentially between an attorney and inmate. All three have been charged for conspiracy to distribute.\n\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, the mailroom supervisor, Marc Fischer, came in contact with the envelope and handled its pages. Within five minutes, he began stumbling around and told coworkers he was “having trouble breathing.” Fellow corrections officers called for medical support, and after two hours and a trip to the hospital, Fischer died.\n\nThe cause of death is still unknown and won’t be identified until toxicology reports are finalized. Secondhand fentanyl exposure shouldn’t be fatal, experts say.\n\nThis is hardly the first case of drug-soaked mail in prisons. In 2019, 122 federal prisons began photocopying inmate letters instead of giving them the originals in an attempt to stop the distribution of any drug concealed in mail or postage. A bill to mandate digital mail-scanning in prisons passed the Senate last year, but it stalled in the House.",

        "content": "Ah, the weekend. Our favorite time of the week. Sure, we love writing about games as much as we love playing them, but getting to indulge in our favorites without worrying about making an article? Pure bliss. On this episode of VICE Games Playdays, we’re going to be chatting about what games we’ll be diving into this weekend, and what we’re looking forward to getting into.\n\nWelcome TO Vice Games PlayDays\n\nScreenshot: Stunlock Studios\n\nThis weekend, I’ll be returning to one of my favorite survival games ever: V Rising. Fun fact – this game helped me get my first writing gig! An ultra-satisfying progression system akin to Valheim, coupled with tons of incredible boss battles, makes V Rising my personal favorite in the survival/crafting/PVP sphere. And, even, years after its release, Stunlock Studios continues to deliver meaty packs of content to satiate any bloodsucker.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nI mean, you get to be a vampire and drain living creatures of their powers. You get to build gorgeous castles and decorate them how you want. And you get to kill other players and steal their loot! Being a vampire has never been more fun.\n\nScreenshot: Bandai Namco Entertainment\n\nThis is the weekend of big changes. Particularly for me. And maybe I’ll get into that down the road because I think it’s a story worth telling. But this time around, I really don’t know what I’m gonna do with myself this weekend. I’ll clear my head with some Madden as usual. But outside of that, the options feel more plentiful.\n\nMaybe some Elden Ring — or I’ll finally make a dent in Returnal. And of course, I have a massive number of indies. I don’t know. I just know things feel more wide open than they ever have. And for that, I’m grateful.\n\nScreenshot: Konami\n\nI’m torn for this VICE Games Playday. On one hand, y’all took to the Yu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection article surprisingly well. So, perhaps I’ll play the next three games and offer some more impressions! Or, I could go the selfish route and play 33 Immortals without the worry of “creating content.” Then again, I feel the pull of the heart of the cards. So, perhaps it’s time to d-d-d-d-d-duel!\n\n…And hopefully never need to duel the same person five times to progress ever again.\n\nScreenshot: Nintendo\n\nIt’s time to say goodbye to my original Nintendo Switch. With the Switch 2 Direct right around the corner, we’ll (hopefully) find out when the next console in the Nintendo family will be available. And what better way to say goodbye to one of my favorite consoles than with one of the most requested games from the Wii U? This weekend, I’ll be diving into Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition for the first time, and I can’t wait to see what Monolith Soft did with the hardware.\n\nThey’re one of the most talented developers that Nintendo can call upon, pushing the hybrid console to its absolute limits. But, if rumor is to be believed, there’s a 60 FPS executable hidden in the game files, meaning that it’s going to run even better on future hardware. I’m already drooling thinking about that.\n\nThat Brings Vice Games Playdays To A Wrap\n\nNow that I’ve officially discovered that V Rising has an offline mode, as well as proper controller support? I’m downloading that right away. It looks like a blast and a half, and who doesn’t want to be a vampire? I just hope we don’t sparkle in this game. But regardless, it seems like we’ve all got quite the gaming feast on our plates for this weekend, so we’ll leave it at that. As always, thanks for tuning in, and keep being awesome.",

        "content": "A group of Canadian firefighters are feeling the heat after their ill-fated Halloween bash. During the North Sydney Firefighters Club’s Halloween dance, a group of four people dressed up as members of the Ku Klux Klan joined in on the festivities.\n\nIn video obtained by CBC News, four people are seen entering the Nova Scotia party wearing white robes and pointed hoods. One person in the racist outfit was carrying a makeshift cross.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nIn a statement to Global News, Fire Chief Lloyd MacIntosh said the people in Ku Klux Klan costumes were admitted by volunteers working the door.\n\n“A mistake was made,” he admitted. “They were allowed in, they shouldn’t have been.”\n\nVolunteers asked the people to remove their hoods, but some refused, MacIntosh said. He added that a volunteer took away the cross one person was carrying.\n\nFirefighters Speak Out About the Racist Costume\n\nIn a statement posted to Facebook, the club admitted that it “made a mistake!”\n\n“We apologize to any and all of our community who were offended or hurt by our lack of actions,” the post read. “These four individuals are in no way, shape or form associated with our organization. We promise to be better in the future.”\n\nWade Gouthro, the Deputy Fire Chief, also spoke out about the controversy in a Facebook post.\n\n“I can honestly tell you that the situation at the North Sydney Firefighters club is not who we are or what we stand for,” Gouthro wrote, before admitting that he’d been “very reluctant” to address the situation due to fear of adding “fuel to the fire.”\n\n“I can tell you this, the members of North Sydney and myself are very sorry from the bottom of our hearts and we ask for your forgiveness,” he continued. “We would certainly never intentionally hurt or insult anyone regardless of race, color, orientation or religion. We spend all of our time trying to do right by the community and are here to do all we can for anyone.”\n\nGouthro added that being “referred to as racists hurts bad.”\n\nWhy KKK-Dressed Attendees Were Admitted to the Party\n\nWhile Gouthro was not working the party in question, he noted that he’s worked the annual event many times in the past.\n\n“When we have Halloween dances you never know what you are going to see come through the door,” he wrote. “Most times we think, ‘Ah it is a costume’ without really thinking of the big picture or the past it represents.”\n\n“So when you folks comment that they shouldn’t have gotten in and that we need to do better, you are right, and we will,” Gouthro continued. “… I will assure you that we are all hurting in our hearts today that we have disappointed a community that we work so hard to make better and protect.”\n\nHe concluded his post by “once again apologizing on behalf of myself and our membership and also a sincere promise to do better in the future.”",

        "title": "The Dark Dreams of Curtis Yarvin, Trump 2.0’s Big Tech Preachertroll",
        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "This is a members-only article from the forthcoming comeback issue of VICE Magazine. To subscribe, visit our membership section—not only will you get four issues of the printed magazine each year, delivered to your door, you’ll also have exclusive early access to our best new documentaries and online content, as well as a raft of members’ perks.\n\nAt the outset of the year, Curtis Yarvin—the blogger whose vision of a new, autocratic U.S. is reportedly gaining traction within the Trump administration—leapt back into the mainstream spotlight, with a New York Times interview headlined: “Curtis Yarvin Says Democracy Is Done. Powerful Conservatives Are Listening.” The article was accompanied by a moody monochromatic portrait that exaggerates Yarvin’s jowls like a veristic bust. One animated version of the photo shows Yarvin ominously drumming his fingers on a table. The implication seems clear: Do those restless fingertips contain the fate of the nation?\n\nIncreasingly, Yarvin has been touted by the media as a key to understanding the American New Right—a Steve Bannonesque figurehead, but for its tech faction rather than its nativist-populist one. He’s a computer engineer who’s been blogging away for decades in the strange world of online ‘neoreaction’ under the dusty fairytale pseudonym “Mencius Moldbug,” and is best known for his idea that American democracy should be replaced by a monarchy that runs the country like a start-up and grants generous privileges to the tech-industrialist elites.\n\nThis has won Yarvin friends in high places. His relationship with billionaire venture capitalist mega-donor Peter Thiel is well publicized. Marc Andreessen and J.D. Vance have cited his work approvingly. Now, with Trump settling back into the White House and indebted to the Bay Area robber barons that helped put him there, it feels as though Yarvin’s public profile has decisively shifted—from geeky fringe blogger to a political-philosopher éminence grise who is laying the discursive groundwork for an “American Caesar.”\n\nClearly, this is how Yarvin wants to be perceived. But take him at face value, and you’re playing a losing game. You’re not going to find a Schmitt or a Machiavelli here, and the joke’s on you for expecting that. Instead, Yarvin is best understood as a kind of spokesperson for ten million brain-fried Twitter anons, a cohort he’s described as the “new public intellectuals” of our “digital age,” and whose scattershot, stream-of-consciousness tub-thumping is currently being reflected in some punchy U.S. government policy. Whether that’s down to Yarvin is hard to discern. It seems unlikely. Yet what’s undeniable is that he finds himself arriving into a cultural moment for which he feels precision-engineered. In Yarvin, Big Tech has found the perfect preachertroll to exalt the deliberate insanity of the ‘move fast and break things’ ethos it’s bringing to nation building, one who knows how to exploit “meme magic” to dream up new truths about the world. In times past, people would’ve called this ‘throwing lots of shit at a wall and seeing what sticks.’ Today, they call it disruption, hyperstition, accelerationism, the future.\n\nThis is why the whole thing makes more sense if you understand Yarvin as a Gen X tech geek playing the part of a poet-guru; someone who can help Silicon Valley sheath its scary, transhumanist vision of the future in ancient mysticism and boomer cool. Look: he’s trying to be Gabriele D’Annunzio in a leather jacket. He’s trying to harness the infinite sexuality of the poète maudit. He wants us to understand that he’s a prophet who has visions; that with his musings on the nature of elves, he’s somehow hallucinating the polity of the future. His swagger is a bit awkward. He’s a socialite who attracts a following of eccentrics. Some people have told me that it’s Yarvin who was responsible for redpilling a lot of the Silicon Valley fat cats, persuading them to indulge their god complexes, insisting that it’s actually chic to openly flirt with immiserating elites and outmoded racial theories, as a way of priming them to support Trump and whoever comes next.\n\nPlay video\n\nIn his interview with the NY Times, Yarvin displays some of the shifty mannerisms you might expect of a contrarian online troll, an identity that to his credit he has partly owned. His habit of peppering italics through his writing is a way of signposting profundity where more often than not, there isn’t any. If you were to lay out his political program in his own style, it could be abridged such: America needs to stop edging and gooning and elect a bareback President, one who is given free rein to be orders of magnitude more powerful. Sounds delectably depraved, doesn’t it? And yet what he really means by that is none other than FDR— ‘And you libs like FDR, don’t you?’ he snickers. The fans are in on the joke but the outsiders tend to give up in frustration—there’s no ‘there’ there, they complain; it’s incoherent and contradictory, it’s childish, it’s a testament to the intellectual vacuity of fascism, there’s no way this sophist charlatan can have any real influence, and so on. Open the schools!\n\nOver the past few years I’ve had a bunch of funny encounters with Yarvin in New York, which he visits somewhat regularly, as if to make routine pilgrimage to the ancestral home of the Beat Generation. The first was a sunny summer day in 2022, at a meetup he had scheduled for his Substack subscribers in a park by the Hudson River. (He sometimes sends out newsletters advertising meetups in various cities; he once even put out a dating call to meet “someone of childbearing age.”) Dozens of Oxford shirt-wearing College Republicans surrounded the master, whose shoulder-length hair rested on his loose, half-buttoned saffron shirt that reminded me of the robes of Theravada monks. He stood in the grass and ruminated on Garibaldi. The disciples asked him questions like, “Who is the most overrated monarch in history?” The crowd was almost entirely male, and I remember some of the guys being disappointed, though not surprised, that no quirked-up cocquettecore girlies with bad politics were in attendance.\n\nLater, in the fall, I saw Yarvin debate the playwright Matthew Gasda on the Shakespeare authorship controversy at a smoky salon in Greenwich Village. If you’re not familiar with this ongoing argument, there’s an “Oxfordian” thesis that the 17th century aristocrat Edward de Vere was the true author of Shakespeare’s works, and that Shakespeare had actually just been De Vere’s rentboy. This was the position Yarvin was arguing; to him, there is simply no way that a lowly, common-born fellow like Shakespeare could ever have portrayed the machinations of aristocratic life so accurately. Gasda—a sort of earnest Belle and Sebastian conservative himself—was arguing the widely accepted “Stratfordian” position, and had studied all night so he was ready to defend the Bard’s honor. Yarvin’s approach was more flippant. “Suppose a corpus of witty, erudite academic novels, set in an unnamed Ivy League English department,” he posited, “is published under the name of an illiterate immigrant from Ghana, who sells sunglasses on a blanket on the street in Morningside Heights?”\n\nIt was a line that sounded familiar, because Yarvin had already published it in a blog on his Substack. Clearly, the Ghanaian immigrant analogy is his go-to line on this subject. In his closing arguments, he went on to suggest that De Vere couldn’t put his own name to his works of genius because he was part of an Elizabethan bohemia of poet-spies who ran psyops for the Queen. Whether the Oxfordian thesis is actually true isn’t so important to Yarvin. What is? Hyperstitioning alternate histories to sow disbelief in the institutions of liberal modernity, ideally in the flippant manner of a social media shitposter. And who better to lap up these myths than the chain-smoking Dimes Square beatniks in the audience?\n\n“The mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level”\n\nIn the following years, I’d run into Yarvin every now and then at salons in other downtown basements. Sometime around Christmas 2023 I went to a reading where the venue hosts, fearing antifa-Dadaist direct action, had hired a bouncer to ensure the poet’s safety. In his signature winter look of all-black jeans and leather jacket, he read works from favorites like W.H. Auden, Robert Lowell, and Robinson Jeffers, as well as some original writing. I found one poem of his—“War”—particularly striking, for how it tried to channel the Futurist ecstasy of combat though the experience of looking at your phone:\n\n“I spend too much time\n\nOn Twitter, following\n\nThe war—probably\n\nOn the wrong side—\n\nNothing is in me to care”\n\nFrom there, the speaker in Yarvin’s poem—presumably Yarvin himself—is mesmerized in a kaleidoscope of disinterested transhistorical enjoyment. The angel of history goonscrolls reality, which in 2025 is a titillating and contextless succession of thirst traps and snuff videos from the front. We learn that war is full of paradoxes—war is pointless but it’s also the only eternal thing in human existence, (“all else fades from the clays”); it’s cool as hell; it’s the worst thing ever; it’s all a big lie, but lies are cool (“The highest art is propaganda” begins another of Yarvin’s poems)—no, it’s peace that is fake; peace disappoints; peace is unsexy; it’s the opposite of love. Of course, this ode to war was probably written in comfortable conditions in Northern California, but the author knows what he’s playing at. The intense traumatic-erotic experience of industrial slaughter is the libidinal origin of fascism, and seems to be a model for Yarvin’s New Right ideology of the future. Yet crucially, the intensity is lacking; these horrors are something the poet and his audience can mostly only experience vicariously, through the internet.\n\nCURTIS YARVIN IN DEFIANT MOOD IN HIS BELOVED NYC. PHOTO BY NICK DOVE.\n\nWhat my experiences in New York tell me is that the mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America—even when intended as ridicule—is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level, validating the idea of his real proximity to power. Even as Trump seems to be attempting some version of the RAGE (Retire All Government Employees) plan that Yarvin has laid out in his blogs, the actual writing is less a guidebook of practical decisions for the American Caesar than a word soup of dazzling lies intended to chip away at the received wisdom of liberal modernity itself.\n\nCase in point: When Yarvin suggests that the wellbeing of Black Americans actually declined after slavery, he’s not interested in a good-faith historical argument. What he seeks to do is undermine the idea that All Men Are Created Equal. He certainly doesn’t need to convince Trump of that one, and it’s not like what Yarvin has to say will be of any direct help in the administration’s coming attempts to destroy the Civil Rights Act. It’s the nativist faction, the intra-administration rivals of Yarvin’s benefactors, who have that covered.\n\nYarvin has a much different function. His dream is to win over the lookers-on: the College Republicans, the Silicon Valley elites, and in New York’s bars and smoke-filled salons the clouted “cool kids” who will one day be in positions of media power great enough to help rewrite history—and maybe let Yarvin fulfill his destiny as the great prophet of a new age of illiteracy, tyranny, and digital psychedelia.\n\nFollow Michael Crumplar @mcrumps",

        "content": "Masked men recently proved the ongoing presence of anti-semites in America. During a performance of The Diary of Anne Frank in Michigan, a group of men holed up in front of the venue, waving Nazi flags and spewing slurs.\n\nThe Fowlerville Community Theatre was hosting the play at American Legion Devereaux Post 141 when they became aware of “the presence of self-identified Nazi protesters,” according to a press release.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nBobby Brite, past commander of the legion, recorded a video of the protestors and shared it to Facebook. He told The Detroit News that the group of 10 masked men chanted things including “Anne Frank was a whore” during their anti-semitic showing. Frank was 15 when she died at a concentration camp in 1945.\n\n“They are some of the most cowardly people I’ve ever met,” Brite told the outlet of the “absolutely disgusting” protest.\n\n“There was a group of people at the four-way intersection in downtown that had swastika flags and American flags,” Alex Sutfill, a witness, told the local CBS station. “They were sticking their arms up and yelling ‘Hail Hitler‘ and ‘Hail Trump’ and everything like that.”\n\nHow the Protest Was Handled\n\nThe theater group alerted the American Legion staff on duty of the situation and was assured they were already aware of and monitoring the men, who moved out of the legion’s parking lot when asked.\n\nAfterwards, the demonstrators went “across the street and waved flags adorned with Nazi insignia,” the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office told The Detroit News. “A subject then approached them, and an argument ensued.”\n\nPeter Damerow told the local CBS station that he was the one who confronted the group. In response, he claimed, “They looked at me and one of them said, ‘No this is Pureville now, and we’re here to make sure it stays pure.’”\n\n“Nothing physical transpired and ultimately the parties involved separated,” the sheriff’s office said.\n\nStill, “out of an abundance of caution,” the group alerted the audience members to the situation at intermission.\n\n“For this production, our cast was also on stage in character during intermission, which was when they found out as well,” the press release read. “Although some were understandably shaken, they pulled together and finished the performance with strength and professionalism.”\n\nHow the Situation Mirrors History\n\nChuck Firman, president of the Fowlerville Community Theatre, added in a statement to the The Detroit News, “It was a scary moment. But really, the show must go on.”\n\nThe theater’s press release further noted how the ordeal, which ended when the protestors left before the end of the show, “gave us a small glimpse of the fear and uncertainty felt by those in hiding.”\n\nIndeed, Brite told the local ABC station, “We had 75 people downstairs that watched that play and out of that 75, there were 50 or 60 of them that were afraid to leave this building. We had to escort them to their cars. No one in America should feel like that.”\n\n“As a theatre, we want to make people feel and think,” the press release read. “We hope that by presenting Anne’s story, we can help prevent the atrocities of the past from happening again.”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League’s Michigan outpost said In a statement, “disgusted by the far-right extremists who praised Hitler and waved Nazi flags” at the event.\n\nIn October, the organization found that, following Hamas’ October 2023 attack on Israel, there were 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. That’s a 200 percent increase from the previous year.",

        "title": "‘Fallout 76’ Gets Players Ready to Fool With the Ghoul In a Massive, Highly Anticipated Update",
        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "Fallout 76, like No Man’s Sky, is one of gaming’s most recent 180-degree turnarounds from its initial launch. Kotaku actually has a great write-up of Fallout 76‘s… troubled early days. But, now, we can talk about the latest major update: Ghoul Within. Which adds many player-requested features. So, what’s the hold-up? Let’s get into it!\n\nPlay video\n\nGhoulification\n\nTo begin your path to the Ghoul life, you’ll have to pick up the Fallout 76 questline “Leap of Faith.” which will then take you into a new section of the Savage Divide. There, you will meet characters who will aid in your transformation.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nCompleting this questline will complete your transformation, unlocking new Ghoul-exclusive abilities Glow and Feral, as well as giving you access to 30 new Ghoul-exclusive Perks.\n\nGhoulities (Abilities)\n\nFeral\n\nBecoming a Ghoul sheds the need to sate your hunger and thirst. Instead, you battle against a gnawing desire to slip back into your base nature, abandoning all sanity you might have had.\n\nThe new Feral meter drains over time and can only be filled back up by consuming Chems. You may not want to keep that meter 100% filled though. Your Feral status provides different bonuses and penalties depending on how full the meter is.\n\nAbove 80%: you gain +3 Strength, +3 Endurance, +30 Max HP\n\nAbove 60%: you gain +15 Max HP\n\nAbove 40%: you lose -1 Endurance and -5 Max HP\n\nAbove 20%: you lose -3 Endurance, -15 Max HP, -10 Max AP\n\nAt 0%: you gain +150% Melee Damage, and lose -5 Endurance, -99 Charisma, -30 Max HP, -20 Max AP, -300% Hip-fire Gun Accuracy & V.A.T.S. Accuracy.\n\nGlow\n\nAs you might expect when living life as a Ghoul, radiation doesn’t have the same effect on you as it does on the smooth-skinned. You’re also immune to diseases and cannot be mutated by nearby radiation. As a Ghoul, radiation makes you Glow!\n\nThis new Glow system also increases your maximum health (and heals damage you’ve taken) based on the amount of radiation that you’ve accumulated. Your Glow can be further tracked by the green-striped pattern on your HP bar.\n\nConsuming tainted foods, drinks and exploring irradiated environments all contribute to your Glow. If you hear that Pip-Boy ticking, the radiation is hitting. While you’re in Power Armor, your radiation intake can be seen on the “Rads” dial next to your health.\n\nOutside of the max health increase Glow provides, it also contributes to Perks like the Science Monster and Jaguar Speed Perks mentioned below!\n\n‘Fallout 76 Ghoul Within’ Gherks (Perks)\n\nOne of the immediate benefits of living life as a Ghoul is that you’ll have access to a new suite of Perk cards,which you can use in addition to the normal human cards. There are 28 Perks to choose from and 2 new Legendary perks for Ghouls.\n\nThe new Perk cards can be attained through Perk card packs or by selecting your level-up Perk. These cards will open new build opportunities and enhance the way you play.\n\nDo note that Perk cards that revolve around Hunger, Thirst and the Chem Resistant perk will be locked as Ghouls don’t require the benefits that those cards provide.\n\nLet’s look at one Perk from each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. category (all Perk descriptions are at their max value):\n\nStrength:\n\nBone Shatterer – Your melee weapon attacks have a 45% chance to cripple a limb.\n\nPerception:\n\nEye of The Hunter – Your vision grants you +30% accuracy in V.A.T.S. from a very long distance.\n\nEndurance:\n\nGlowing Gut – Irradiated food and drink grant 300% more rads.\n\nCharisma:\n\nMoral Support – When on a team, you become feral 50% slower.\n\nIntelligence:\n\nScience Monster – While you have Glow, gain 15% bonus damage for 10 seconds upon getting hit.\n\nAgility:\n\nJaguar Speed – You now sprint 20% faster when your Glow is high.\n\nLuck:\n\nWild West Hands – 36% chance to instantly reload your entire magazine when empty.\n\nA Ghoul’s Day Out\n\nWith all these new benefits that help you explore the wasteland, however, we would forgive you for thinking that life as a Ghoul was easy. No matter how well dressed you are, there are still some factions (like the Brotherhood of Steel) who won’t want to interact with you.\n\nPlaying as a Ghoul will make some factions hostile to you which will lock you out of some quest lines. Luckily wearing disguises made by Jaye, a new NPC you’ll meet along the new questline, will allow you to interact with any blocked content that you may find when living life as a Ghoul. Jaye will also allow you to remove the disguise if you so wish.\n\nBack to Humanity\n\nIf after a short while you realize that being a Ghoul isn’t for you, you can become human again through your Character Screen.\n\nPlease note: this is a one-way ticket back. You won’t be able to complete the questline to become a Ghoul again.\n\nIf you want a character that has already completed the “Leap of Faith” questline to become a Ghoul again, you can purchase a Ghoul Retransformation which will be available on the character screen for 1000 Atoms.\n\n‘Fallout 76 Ghoul Within’ Season 20 – Glow of the Ghoul Details\n\nBask in the “Glow of the Ghoul” and earn new Ghoulish rewards throughout your journey.\n\nFor a complete look at what awaits you this season, check out our Season 20 article here!\n\nThe Big Bloom – Starting April 29\n\nSpring is on the way which means the new themed event begins on April 29!\n\nWe hope you look forward to helping Black-eyed Susan save her favorite meadow from the Overgrown.\n\n‘Fallout 76 Ghoul Within’ Level 50 Character Boost\n\nFor new and veteran Wastelanders alike, the new Level 50 Character Boost is a great way to get a new character ready to participate in Daily Ops, Public Events, and explore Appalachia!\n\nCheck out our article for more information.\n\n‘Fallout 76’ Release Notes\n\nAccessibility\n\nFixed an issue where the Text to Speech window could persist through various menus.\n\nFixed an issue where a chosen Screen Narration Voice Type could reset after relaunching the game.\n\nFixed an issue where menus would not scroll properly while using Text to Speech or Speech to Text options.\n\nAmmo\n\nPlasma and Ultracite Cores now display their charge value.\n\nFully charged Fusion, Plasma and Ultracite Cores can now be placed in the Ammo Box.\n\nFusion Cores count as in use while in Power Armor when storing unused ammo in the Ammo Box.\n\nFusion Cores assigned to Power Armor cannot be stored in the Ammo Box.\n\nArmor\n\nFixed an issue where the V63 Jetpack Paint could not be applied to the Vulcan Jetpack.\n\nEnclave Technician Headwear now provides correct “Damage & Disease resistance against airborne hazards”.\n\nHazmat and Chinese Stealth Suit now count as wearing a full matching set of armor.\n\nHazmat Suit is now in the Armor category in the Pip-boy.\n\nC.A.M.P.\n\nExpanded the area of passive power for the Winter Retreat workshop structure.\n\nFixed an issue where workshop items would not place correctly while using Free Cam in the Summer Camp Shelter.\n\nStored C.A.M.P.

In addition to this, a few pistols have received a further increase to their base damage.\n\nThe following Fallout 76 weapons can be converted to Rifles via mods and thus will have their base damage further increased in the future:\n\nPipe Gun\n\nPipe Revolver\n\nPipe Bolt-Action\n\nLaser Gun\n\nUltracite Laser Gun\n\nPlasma Gun\n\nEnclave Plasma Gun\n\nWeapon Damage Changes\n\nThe base damage values listed here represent the weapon at its max level (45 or 50).

        "content": "More infants died in the U.S. after Roe V. Wade was overturned.\n\nEarlier this year, a Texas study found increased infant mortality rates in the 18 months after the state’s six-week abortion ban went into effect in 2021.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe latest study, which was penned by Parvati Singh and Dr. Maria Gallo and published in JAMA Pediatrics, built on that research. It took a look at infant mortality nationwide after Roe V. Wade was overturned in 2022.\n\nThe study found that infant mortality was up to seven percent higher than normal in certain months, which is equivalent to an average of 247 more deaths.\n\nThe jump was most pronounced—a 10 percent rise—among infants with congenital anomalies. That is likely due to more frail fetuses being carried to term amid abortion restrictions, the study suggested.\n\n“I’m not sure that people expected infant mortality rates to increase following Dobbs. It’s not necessarily what people were thinking about,” Gallo told Ohio State News. “But when you restrict access to health care it can cause a broader impact on public health than can be foreseen.”\n\nSingh agreed, telling CNN that the research “is evidence of a national ripple effect, regardless of state-level status.”\n\n“This is the tip of the iceberg,” she said. “Mortality is the ultimate outcome of any health condition. This is a very, very acute indicator. It could be representative of underlying morbidity and underlying hardship.”\n\nSingh told the first outlet that she now wants to explore maternal and infant mortality rates among various populations.\n\n“There’s a broader human toll to consider,” she said, “including mental health consequences of being denied abortion care or being forced to carry a fetus with a fatal genetic abnormality to term.”",

        "content": "Does the time of the month that a baby is conceived affect if it’s a boy or a girl?\n\nIt’s possible, says British mathematician Hannah Fry.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“The chances of a woman conceiving a male or female child actually very subtly changes depending on when in her cycle she conceives,” Fry explained in a video on her Instagram page. “So slightly earlier, ever so slightly more likely that she’ll have a baby boy.”\n\nHowever, Fry said the odds are “way too small” for couples to use that as a predictor.\n\nThe larger point of her investigation was analyzing gender trends over time. With data focusing on England and Wales, she explored something called the “returning soldier effect,” which shows spikes in male birth rates following World War I and II.\n\nThe trend, which has also been observed in other countries, has several possible explanations.\n\nOne controversial theory is that healthier soldiers are more likely to survive war and come home. That, combined with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis —which posits that healthier people are more likely to conceive boys—could explain the spike.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that the increase in male births is nature’s way of compensating for the loss of life during the war.\n\nThe ‘returning soldier effect’ is just one possible explanation for birth rate trends\n\nFry admits that there’s no way to tell for certain what causes more male births than female, or vice versa. There are also dozens, if not hundreds, of other factors that come into play, including the health of the mothers and environmental conditions.\n\nFor example, writing in 2008, William H. James observed a decline in male birth rates in Iran during and following the Iran-Iraq war. He attributed the fall to “psychological stress causing pregnant women disproportionately to abort male fetuses.”\n\nHowever, the “returning soldier effect” definitely has a basis in fact.\n\n“At the end of a war, everyone has much more sex than normal,” Fry noted. “Women get pregnant slightly earlier in their cycles, and as a result, there is a spike in the number of baby boys that are born.”",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "British comedian Jamali Maddix is well known around these parts for his acclaimed VICELAND show on zealots, racists, and other angry people, Hate Thy Neighbor. Lately, Jamali’s been back on the extremist beat, hanging out with pedophile hunters and a gun cult led by a man named ‘King Bullethead’ for a new TV docuseries.\n\nWe called him up to get a read on Follow The Leader, set to air from September 17th in the UK.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nVICE: Hey Jamali. Obviously this beat is a familiar one for you. But how have extreme ways of thinking, cults, etc. all developed and changed in recent years?\n\nJamali Maddix: I think the internet changed everything when it comes to those communities. If there was a small group in a small town in America, it stayed within that small town in America. But things spread more now, so you’ve got movements or ideas that can spread easily. And the cost of making content has dropped dramatically. So you’ve got men and women making their content, of whatever their ideas are, at a high quality—and they can push it out on the biggest channel in the world, which is the internet, you know? So I think these ideas are more easily accessible than ever.\n\nYeah, it’s also interesting how everyone’s nan now seems to have quite a fringe view of the world.\n\nWhen it comes to certain views—maybe political or low-end conspiratorial views—it’s also because there’s so much information. I think it’s difficult for certain generations to decipher what is and isn’t real, because there’s a generation of people who grew up when newspapers were just… I mean, obviously, there’s always been lies in newspapers, but journalists investigated a story and then they presented the story, maybe with a twinge of political bias, but they presented pretty much the story—and now it’s just, “I can make a website and say whatever I want,” and it’s considered fact. So I don’t think everyone’s got a ‘fringe’ view. It’s just some people can’t decipher between what is the real and the fake thing on the internet.\n\nAI images are going to change things a lot as well, because they will actually trick people’s eyes into thinking real images—things that have never happened—actually happened. It’s gonna be a weird future.\n\nWhat role has COVID played in all this?\n\nI think people during COVID had a lot of time to think. It’s not my line, but a comedian once said to me: “Some people have too much time to think, and they have arguments with themselves that they always win.” I think people had so much time on their hands, and they reflected on their life and made more brash decisions.\n\nIn terms of the new series, Rod of Iron [a militant pro-gun offshoot of the Moonies religious movement, led by brothers Yung Jin Moon and Kook-jin Moon] used a lot of people’s apprehension [of the vaccine] to draw more people towards their ideas.\n\nJamali shares a moment wtih an interviewee in ‘follow the leader’ (credit: uktv)\n\nSo what’s some of the exciting new stuff that you unearthed while shooting this series?\n\nI enjoyed doing the predator hunter one; I enjoyed doing the passport bro one. I don’t know what mad things I uncovered. I don’t think there was like a mad…\n\nPredator hunter as in like…?\n\nIt’s people who they’ve alleged to have spoken to underaged children, and then they go and confront them.\n\nI think there’s something a bit off about that.\n\nYeah. In the film, it’s that complication. That’s what the film’s about, is the complicated nature of it, because we all agree that’s a bad crime, but it’s like, should they be… you know what I mean? All those questions get thrown up, and there isn’t really a definitive answer to it. That’s how I wanted to make it. I wanted it to be as if the audience member decides for themselves, where their morality lies within it, you know?\n\nHas anything in your films made you feel like “we’re fucked”?\n\nI felt that going in.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that’s just apparent with the state of the world. I don’t think my docs are going to be the change of that; I’m not the canary in the coal mine. Human beings, we just adjust. If you would have said pre-COVID, there’ll be a time when you can’t go out for two years. You would have gone, “Nah, fucking I’ll go mad.” But you did it. You know what I mean? If you went to prison in fucking, the world’s worst prison, the first few days [would be tough], but after a couple months, you’d adjust. That’s just how human beings are. We just adjust, or we don’t and we don’t survive. And I think human beings just survive. So I think wherever the world goes, whether it’s the internet or whether it’s this, we just adjust, or we don’t. That’s the two options we have. The films are just exploring what’s going on and the people behind it.\n\nJamali Maddix: Follow The Leader airs on U&Dave at 10PM each Tuesday from 17th September, with the box-set available to stream free on U from Tuesday 17th September.\n\nFollow Nick Thompson on X at @niche_t_",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "The family and friends of Johan Floderus, a Swedish diplomat potentially facing the death penalty in Iran, have told VICE News he has endured a “horrible situation” during his 20-month-long detention in a notorious Tehran prison.\n\nFlorerus, a 33-year-old working with Afghan refugees in Iran on behalf of the EU was detained in April 2022 at Tehran’s airport as he was visiting on a holiday trip and then accused of spying for Iran’s foes, in particular, Israel. He was charged and tried for “corruption on earth,” or stymieing the cause of the Iranian revolution, in the Islamic Republic’s religious courts, a charge that can be punished with death. He is the latest victim of a repeating pattern in which foreign nationals are entangled in a legal ordeal in Iran in order for the country’s ruling mullahs to extort money or other goals from the West.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAfraid that quiet diplomacy wasn’t working, Floderus’s loved ones broke their silence in December last year and, on Thursday, went to Brussels to hold an event to raise awareness of his case with European officials.\n\nFloderus’s sister Ingrid told VICE News: “We are very close with Johan and always spoke on almost a daily basis. He is such a freedom-loving and stubborn person. Since his arrest, we have been only able to talk a few times. I can’t imagine how horrible the situation he is in, but he is still full of life and trying to stay strong.”\n\n“Johan is someone full of life and always had a curious soul, and he always traveled around the world and spoke Farsi, and he visited Iran multiple times, and worked there.”\n\nJohan Floderus in a sup\n\nIn Iran, all foreign nationals are closely monitored, and their movements must be approved by local authorities. Despite repeated calls from both the EU and Sweden to release Floderus, the Iranian judiciary has insisted that they have enough evidence to prosecute him on espionage charges.\n\nThe Swede is held in Tehran’s Evin prison and his case is being handled by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran, headed by the clerical judge, Iman Afshari, already notorious for his passing unjust prison sentences on political activists, artists, and women.\n\nLast Sunday, the court concluded Floderus’s hearing after five sessions in an almost-empty courtroom, which the Swedish man attended in a prison uniform with his state-appointed lawyer and translator. Mizan News, the Iranian judiciary’s official outlet, reported that the prosecutors accused Floderus of a “very extensive intelligence cooperation with the Zionist occupation regime,” and said that his travel history was clear evidence of his involvement in activities that “threaten Iran’s national security”.\n\nAfshari gave a week for Floderus’ lawyer to submit their defense, and did not give a verdict date.\n\nWant the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nDespite denials from the Iranian government, rights groups and Western governments have repeatedly accused the Islamic Republic of “hostage diplomacy” by using trumped-up charges such as “corruption on earth” to extract political concessions, release funds held abroad by international sanctions, or in prisoner exchanges.\n\nFloderus’s arrest is likely to put pressure on Sweden in the case of the arrest of Iranian former prison official Hamid Nouri.\n\nNouri was detained upon arrival at Stockholm Airport in November 2019, and later charged with involvement in the killing of thousands of Iranian political prisoners in 1988.\n\nJohan and his sister Ingrid.\n\nThe former prison official was sentenced to life “for grave breaches of international humanitarian law and murder,” by a Swedish court after the prosecution asked for the maximum penalty in July 2022. The outcome was hailed as a rare human rights success against Iranian regime officials, but outraged the government in Tehran, which called the case “politically motivated.”\n\nLast Sunday, the Iranian prosecutor asked for the maximum penalty in Floderus’s case – either life in prison or the death sentence given the “important nature and adverse affects of the accused’s actions.”\n\nThe diplomat’s family had kept quiet about the arrest on the advice of the Swedish authorities as they tried to resolve the issue through “silent diplomacy,” and launched a public campaign after the news broke out at the end of last year, and losing hope that Floderus would be released through back-channel talks.\n\n“Other governments go the distance to protect their citizens, and I hope that Sweden will do that too. Johan is my brother, and his freedom and well-being are the most important thing in the world. So of course I feel that you should use every tool in the toolbox,” said his sister, Ingrid.\n\nEmily Atkinson, a close friend of Floderus, said: “Johan is someone who always brings people together. We have been left with a massive gap in our life without him, and we are also being taken hostage by the appalling situation,” she said as she struggled to keep back tears during a conversation with VICE News\n\n“I want to say: Johan, hold on. We’re here for you. We’ve rallied for you. We’re speaking up for you, and we’re here waiting for you. Hold on and stay strong.”",

        "content": "A special court martial handed down a reprimand to an Army lieutenant colonel who was caught putting cameras in the dressing room of a clothing store by a 16-year-old girl. The Lt. Col., who fled from police when caught, pleaded guilty but will serve no jail time.\n\nThe slap on the wrist comes after civilian prosecutors initially attempted to pursue a criminal conviction. The Army convinced the court to let it handle the matter internally, however, and the officer was instead prosecuted through the Uniform Code of Military Justice. (UCMJ). Further, Motherboard found while seeking records related to the case that the court documents have since been sealed.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe case illustrates a disturbing trend where the Pentagon swoops in to protect its soldiers when they commit a crime. If convicted in a civilian court, Sweatland could have served up to a year in jail. Instead, a military judge issued a reprimand, an official black mark on Swetland’s military record.\n\nWhen asked if Sweatland would have to register as a sex offer, a representative for the U.S. Army Cadet Command told Motherboard it would comply with state law. “A court-martial convicted Lt. Col. Sweatland of a qualifying sex-related offense. The Army is complying with all sex-related offense processing requirements,” Maj. Dan Lessard, spokesman for U.S. Army Cadet Command, told Motherboard.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Lt. Col. Jacob Sweatland was the head of the Army’s Reserve Offcier’s Training Corps program at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. He was responsible for shaping a new generation of U.S. military officers. In September 2022, Sweatland left a key fob with a hidden camera in it at a PacSun in San Luis Obispo. A 16-year-old girl found the camera and turned it in, and the store called the cops.\n\nThe cops took a look at the camera and found it still contained images and video from other dressing rooms in the area. Sweatland later called the store asking if anyone had found his key fob. The clerk, who was working with police, told Sweatland that someone had found it and he could come and retrieve it. The cops were waiting at the scene.\n\nThe details of the case from San Luis Obispo court records which were publicly available at the time of Sweatland’s arrest but are now sealed as part of his plea deal. Pieces of the records still exist from local reporting over the past few years. According to the now-sealed court records, which said that Sweatland faced charges of resisting arrest and obstructing justice in addition to invasion of privacy, the Lt. Col. fled when he got to the store and saw the cops. The police eventually tracked Sweatland down and arrested him.\n\nMustang News, reporting based on court records that were available in 2023, said that Sweatland’s fob contained images from several locations including other retail establishments and the gym at the Cal Poly Rec center. The video was shot “from covert angles” and showed “women’s backsides as they [preformed] various exercises wearing shorts and tight fitting athletic wear.” At the time of his arrest, Sweatland was removed from his position at the University but wasn’t charged for the recordings because they were taken in a public area.\n\nAs the case against Sweatland moved forward last year, he and his lawyers did what they could to avoid civilian justice. Before the case was handed over to military prosecutors, Sweatland attempted to get it dismissed as a “Military Diversion.” In California, veterans and servicemembers can ask for courts to dismiss charges if the defendant is “suffering from sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems as a result of his or her military service.”\n\nAccording to court records, Sweatland’s defense team claimed that he’d undergone intensive therapy since his arrest. Sweatland’s service was no joke, he deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Colombia and earned a Bronze Star and a Ranger Tab. He saw combat and it’s possible he’s suffering from service related PTSD. But the court of SLO wasn’t buying it.\n\n“The calculated and covert method in which Defendant repeatedly targeted vulnerable young women demonstrates little potential for rehabilitation in the Military Diversion Program,” court records filed by the prosecutors said.\n\nAfter his attempt at using the Military Diversion Program was thwarted, the Army stepped in.\n\n“When disposing of allegations of misconduct, the Army regularly coordinates with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and prosecution authorities. In July 2023, the San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office initiated contact with the Army and requested the Army prosecute this case,” Lessard said. “After careful consideration of the evidence and in consultation with the victim, the Army preferred court-martial charges against Lt. Col. Sweatland on July 13, 2023.”\n\nThe military conducted an investigation of its own and handed down the reprimand during a special court martial. “On Jan. 22, 2024, at a special court-martial convened at Fort Knox, Ky., Lt. Col. Jacob J. Sweatland was convicted by a military judge, pursuant to his pleas, of one specification of indecent visual recording and one specification of conduct unbecoming an officer in violation of Articles 120c and 133, UCMJ. The military judge sentenced the accused to be reprimanded. The sentence was consistent with the terms of a plea agreement,” Lessard told Motherboard.\n\nHe explained that a reprimand is a punitive public censure. “A reprimand reflects negatively on a soldier’s military record and negatively affects a soldier’s career,” Lessard said. Despite the black mark, Sweatland does still have a career. He is currently assigned to the 8th Brigade of U.S. Army Cadet Command and is serving in an administrative role away from cadets.”\n\nThe Sweatland case highlights a problem with civilian-military relations and the Pentagon writ large. This is a persistent problem in the Army. In 2017, a soldier at Fort Hood allegedly assaulted his wife and fired a gun as she fled their home. The Army kicked him out of the service but did not pursue a case against him. The same thing happened the same year in Alaska after a soldier was accused of sexually assaulting a fellow soldier.\n\nIn both cases, there was physical evidence of the crime and no prosecution. The soldiers were simply allowed to return to civilian life. The Pentagon often runs cover for its soldiers, which creates a separate system of justice for those who serve.\n\nMotherboard asked Cadet Command to respond to concerns that the Army’s handling of Sweatland would be viewed as a slap on the wrist. “A court-martial convicted and punished Lt. Col. Sweatland under adherence to the rules and procedures prescribed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. We have no further comment on this matter while it is subject to appellate review,” Lessard said.\n\nUpdate 2/9: This article was updated with more information from U.S. Army Cadet Command spokesperson Maj. Dan Lessard and the subhed has been changed to reflect this information.",

        "content": "No more bald jokes, girls.\n\nI’ll be the first to say that superficial comments and judgments about someone’s physical appearance are not cool. But to label bald jokes a form of sexual harassment? Seems a bit extreme.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nApparently, the High Court thinks otherwise.\n\nThis whole lengthy case started back in 2019 when an electrician named Tony Finn accused his boss of sexual harassment. Allegedly, Finn’s boss at the British Bung Company had referred to him as a “stupid bald cunt.”\n\nMaybe this is my American sensibilities, but I’m thinking maybe the C-word is more of an issue here—but I digress.\n\nAccording to the panel of judges, led by Judge Jonathan Brain, the term “bald” is “inherently related to gender,” so using it against a man could breach equality laws. In other words, “bald” is a sexist insult.\n\nThe three-person panel also stated that the remark “crossed a line” and there is “a connection between the word ‘bald’ and the protected characteristic of sex.”\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the panel consisted of three bald men.\n\n“[Baldness] is much more prevalent in men than women,” they said. (K, well, tell that to the PCOS community.)\n\nNow, according to The Sun, the full judgment made at the Employment Appeals Tribunal has finally been published—four years after the initial comments against Finn. The electrician will likely receive compensation for the alleged sexual harassment.\n\nAs expected, this case is gaining major traction on social media, with many users expressing their disbelief over the ruling.\n\n“This is silly,” one person wrote. “We should all strive to be better people and to be more understanding and supportive with those who are missing something. But it seems silly to waste the court’s time with things so small.”\n\nMost others labeled the notion as nonsense.\n\nHowever, one person posed a different perspective: “I think it’s a bit extreme, but I can see the precedent. If people cannot joke about something a woman cannot control, then why should they be able to joke about something a man cannot control?”\n\nShrugs.",

To carry that torch every day and keep my focus on being a coach, it definitely puts meaning into the work.”\n\nWhat is Jessica Campbell’s Background?\n\nAssistant coach Jessica Campbell of the Seattle Kraken (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)\n\nCampbell was a renowned hockey player before joining the Kraken as an assistant coach. She starred at Cornell University, where she was a team captain and hit the 100-point mark for the University.\n\nShe turned pro and spent time with the Calgary Inferno before playing internationally in Sweden.\n\nAfter her playing days, she was a trailblazer in the American Hockey League as the first female coach with the Kraken’s minor league team, the Coachella Valley Firebuds. She was there from 2022 to 2024 before moving to the NHL.\n\nHow Many Women Coach in other leagues?\n\nWhile Campbell broke down the walls at the NHL level, the other three major leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA) have already done so.\n\nAt the start of the 2024 season, 15 women held full-time coaching positions in the NFL.\n\nIn 2023, MLB had 43 women coaching.\n\nBecky Hammon was the first woman to serve as an acting head coach, with the San Antonio Spurs in 2020.

        "content": "President Donald Trump utilized his first day back in office to put a handful of executive orders in motion, one of which was announcing the United States’ withdrawal from the WHO, the World Health Organization.\n\nThis wasn’t exactly a surprising move, considering Trump’s history with the organization. He attempted to remove the U.S. from the WHO in 2020 before Joe Biden overturned the decision and resumed funding for the organization. One of Trump’s major running points during his campaign was keeping American dollars in-house and not paying for what he perceived to be a waste of funds, which always meant the WHO was in jeopardy.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nTrump cited the organization’s “mishandling” of the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reason for the decision.\n\nDonald Trump Pulls The United States Out of the WHO\n\nAbove all else, it’s the money the country has invested in the WHO that ultimately fueled the decision. America has been the WHO’s largest donor since its inception in 1948. The country has routinely given around $163 million in yearly contributions, with that number going as high as over $800 million at times. There are up to 194 countries involved in the WHO, with America providing up to a fifth of the organization’s funding, per USA Today.\n\n“Everybody rips off the United States and that’s it—it’s not going to happen anymore,” Trump said on Monday during a press conference.\n\nWithout the United States providing funding, the WHO will now likely lean on China, which has typically been the next largest provider. The order signed by Trump on Monday specifically mentions the population size of China and the fact that, despite it being far larger than The States’, the country pays less than 90% of what America does to the WHO.\n\nJapan, Germany, and the United Kingdom have rounded out the top five contributing countries over the years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has yet to comment on Monday’s order.",

        "content": "Another day, another creative— though failed—attempt at smuggling drugs. Colombian officials at Rafael Nunez International Airport were in for a surprise when they discovered someone attempting to get one by them through a disguise. A man was departing on an Amsterdam flight when he was footsteps away from stepping onto his plane when authorities pulled him aside because they were suspicious of… his hair.\n\nExcept it wasn’t his hair, it was a wig. While he made it through the security checkpoints and presumably thought he was in the clear, the 40-year-old dealer was monitored leading up to the boarding process. Eventually, the suspicion grew to a point where they had to step in and investigate what they suspected was a unique smuggling vessel.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nA Drug Dealer Tried to Conceal Cocaine in His Wig—And Failed\n\nPhotos from the scene showed the man’s wig being cut into and beneath it was nine cocaine capsules, according to TMZ. The black wig was able to conceal them initially before the security scanner uncovered the secret.\n\nWhen the wig was fully cut off, it showed the pods engrained in the inner part of the wig. I can’t imagine it was comfortable at all, but it nearly worked. Props to security for suspecting that something was off about the hairdo. The BBC reports that the street value of the drugs, which weighed in at 220 grams, would have equated to $10,450 U.S. dollars.\n\nColumbia is known to be the most prevalent cocaine exporter in the country, so it’s no wonder that airport security has its guard up for anything that seems out of place. Clearly, the wig set off enough alarms with officials that they tracked him throughout the airport before concluding that they needed to intervene before he headed to Amsterdam.\n\nIt’s been a busy month for wild drug dealing stories. The wig-concealing-cocaine tactic is the most interesting, but perhaps the most intricate was what came out of the Morocco and Spain border. That’s where a drug smuggling tunnel was discovered, connecting the two countries between the only land border.",

The August 2023 blaze that left more than 100 people dead was caused by the re-energization of broken utility lines in Lahaina, according to an investigation released Wednesday by the Maui Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nThe fire has been classified as accidental. Per the report, the re-energization of the line caused sparks, which ignited overgrown vegetation at a surrounding utility pole. The overhead and energized power line fell to the ground, further igniting vegetation.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nInvestigators initially believed they had extinguished the fire, which started around 6:30 AM, but undetected smoldering material reignited the second phase of the fire hours later, just before 3 PM.\n\n“We want to make abundantly clear to Lahaina and to our Maui community that our firefighters went above and beyond their due diligence to be as confident as they could be that the fire was completely extinguished before they left the scene,” Assistant Chief Jeffrey Giesea said, per NBC News.\n\nAccording to the report, “Fed by extreme winds, the fire quickly grew out of control, jumped the bypass, and resulted in the subsequent conflagration from which our island community is still recovering.”\n\nThe fire destroyed over 2,000 structures and caused $6 billion in damages.\n\nThe report’s findings may or may not sway conspiracy theorists who believe the U.S. government used directed energy weapons to cause the deadly blazes to turn Maui into a “smart island.”",

Some days, the job meant hearing from contracted workers in the Global South complaining that they hadn’t been paid. Other times, it would be counseling those driven into a state of extreme mental disrepair by allegedly working 31 days straight to keep the pipeline running.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“There’d be times I would close my eyes to go to bed at night and I would just picture burning bodies bobbing around in a water that was on fire,” our Informer says at one point during the interview. “That was basically the nightmare they were talking about that could come true.”\n\nThink your job is stressful?

You can watch the film now at YouTube or in the player below.\n\nPlay video\n\nNow, here’s an interview about the interview, with VICE director Alexi Phillips.\n\nVICE: First of all, thanks for making this intensely depressing film for me to watch. I haven’t slept since.\n\nAlexi Phillips: No worries.\n\nHow did the Shell informer first get in touch?\n\nI can’t really disclose that.\n\nMost of what’s talked about is disconcerting. How does this stuff stay out of the news?\n\nMost of these spills happen in countries that don’t get much media attention. Every once in a while a massive event, like what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, makes the news but the fact that there are thousands of tiny spills every day is just seen as more of the status quo and not remarkable enough to be ‘breaking news.’\n\nI was assuming the dangers of oil production would primarily be posed to the environment, or to members of the public whose lands or waters are suddenly destroyed by a big spill. I wasn’t expecting to hear that people actually working for these companies would be losing their lives, too.\n\nYeah, they are working in highly pressurized environments, with extremely combustible liquid and gas, so the risk is inherent—especially when they’re working offshore. But the danger is exacerbated by the crazy demands to continue pumping large quantities of oil, with a focus on profits above everything else.\n\nWhat surprised you most about what the Shell informer had to say?\n\nSadly, I was not that surprised. In all honesty I think that was my big takeaway from the interview. There was nothing she could tell me about that industry that would shock me or that I couldn’t believe.\n\nWhat changes do you hope these big oil companies to make in the future?\n\nI hope they get more robustly regulated, as I think they have demonstrated they cannot be trusted with our future.\n\nWhat changes do you expect these big oil companies to make in the future?\n\nI expect that they will talk a big talk and walk a tiny walk.\n\nYou can watch the latest episode of Informer now at YouTube.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Shell said: “Respect for human rights is fundamental to Shell’s core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and is embedded into our existing framework, such as our Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct details how employees, contractors and anyone else acting on behalf of Shell must behave to live up to our business principles.”",

        "title": "Percival Everett Is Challenging the American Literary Canon",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Percival Everett claims he is not as brilliant as his fans know him to be. He deeply researches the worlds in which his novels are set, yet swears that everything he learns falls out of his head as soon as each book is published. “So I’m no smarter at the end than I was at the beginning,” he says, shrugging his shoulders. Years ago, sick of his writing students asking him if they were good enough to be published, he took a class to a bookstore in Middlebury, Vt., to prove he was not unique. “Look around,” he told them. “Anyone can be published. ‘Are you good enough to make a difference?’ is the question.”\n\nWith his latest, James, a reimagining of Huckleberry Finn told from the perspective of the escaped slave Jim—who drops his nickname for the more noble-sounding James—Everett has jump-started a conversation about the great American novel, how issues of race interplay with the so-called American canon, and how we talk to our children about America’s past. But just a few hours before he wins the National Book Award for fiction, he demurs when pressed on the book’s impact. “If a reader is coming to me for any kind of message or answer about anything in the world,” he says, “they’re already in deep trouble.”\n\nFor many, however, James has become an important companion piece to Mark Twain’s work, the book “all American literature comes from,” to quote Ernest Hemingway. “I’ve been getting lots of mail from former and current English teachers thanking me that they can now teach Huck Finn again because they can do it alongside James,” he admits, “which is great news for me and certainly flattering, but doesn’t come as a great surprise. It’s a problematic text.”\n\nEverett, 68, would do away with the canon altogether if he could. But at the very least he hopes that writers, readers, and educators can acknowledge the inherent issues with putting certain books on a pedestal. “My joke is, ‘The canon is loaded,’” says Everett. “Canon formation is necessarily skewed. It’s necessarily racist and sexist. As soon as you’re saying there are these texts that must be read, someone has to choose. Who chooses?”\n\nWhile Jim is little more than a sidekick on Huck’s journey down the Mississippi in the original, in Everett’s version he is at the center of the story. James and other Black characters code switch when white characters are present; on his own, James interrogates philosophers like Voltaire for his repugnant views on slavery. “Enslaved people, it had occurred to me, are always depicted as simple-minded and superstitious, and of course, they weren’t,” Everett says. “So I embarked on this.”\n\nEverett gives James the gift of language, and James writes his account of his travels with a stolen pencil stub—one which comes at great human cost. “Whoever controls language, controls everything. If someone has no voice, they cannot get what they want or what they need,” says Everett.\n\nEverett, who has published two dozen novels, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Telephone, has historically bristled at being categorized in the genre of African American fiction, especially considering he has written everything from propulsive westerns to a novella styled like a Lifetime movie. “Any work of art that comes out of this American culture is about race. If there is no race in it, that is a statement about race,” he says.\n\nThis frustration is at the heart of Erasure, one of Everett’s early and best-known novels, which was adapted into the Oscar-winning 2023 film American Fiction. The story centers on Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, the author of experimental novels that don’t sell particularly well. Monk becomes so exasperated with the publishing industry bolstering Black fiction that depicts only stereotypes that he pens a novel as an illiterate thug to prove a point. The book is a hit, much to the author’s chagrin. James, too, will get the Hollywood treatment, with Steven Spielberg producing and Taika Waititi in talks to direct, though Everett insists this attention is “fleeting.” “I'll write some experimental novel next that no one will understand,” he says. “You would have to be crazy to get into literary fiction to get famous or to get rich.”",

        "title": "Developing Countries Chart New Climate Path as Trump Returns",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley has become a leading champion of small economies in global climate discussions. And so I took note at last year’s United Nations climate conference when she said she thought countries should engage then-President elect Trump to try to explain the importance of climate work. “I am not one of those who will come out and say immediately that with the election of President Trump all is gloom and doom,” she said at a fireside chat last November. “We need to find mechanisms… to have the conversations.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMottley’s position has evolved since then. Trump entered office in January with an aggressive agenda to attack clean energy and end collaboration on climate change. Last week, as delegates from around the world gathered in Barbados for a sustainable energy conference, Mottley instead insisted that small countries would need to find their own way forward. “You don't spend time or energy praying over what could have been,” she said. “But we deal with the world as it is.” Across three days of talks at the SEforAll Global Forum in Barbados, Trump barely came up explicitly. It’s not that anyone there underestimated the consequences of his election for global climate progress. Rather, his election has finally sunk in, and attention has turned to paving a path forward—without the U.S. It’s a telling glimpse at how climate discussions may be shifting. The gravitational pull of the U.S. should not be dismissed; some countries will inevitably follow his lead. Nonetheless, if the conversations in Barbados provide any indication, many emerging and developing economies remain eager to forge their own clean energy path.\n\nThe U.S. shadow has always loomed large over international climate collaboration. As the world’s largest economy and only superpower, climate negotiators had to adjust language carefully to respond to the U.S. political context. With the Paris Agreement in place, conversations have largely focused on finance—getting money flowing to energy transition projects, particularly in developing and emerging economies. But despite the central role the U.S. played in setting up the system, U.S. public money never came to represent the lifeblood of international climate finance—even as developing countries and climate advocates insisted that the country owed it to the rest of the world to pay up because of its historical emissions. Even in the climate-friendly Biden Administration, it took significant wrangling for the White House to commit to $11 billion in annual international climate finance. To put that in perspective, developing countries left last year’s U.N. climate talks disappointed that their wealthier counterparts committed only to a total $300 billion in annual climate finance.\n\nIn other words, on the finance front, the U.S. isn’t leaving that big of a gap to fill. So where will the money come from? One key area under discussion at the SEforAll forum, where I spoke with officials in the public and private sectors based everywhere from Fiji to Sierra Leone, was so-called south-south collaboration. Instead of looking to the U.S. and Europe to pony up capital, developing and emerging market countries can work together—providing the goods and finance without the help of their wealthier counterparts. According to research from the Brookings Institution, trade between Global South countries recently surpassed trade between Global North countries. “This is a great signal of progress,” Arancha González, a former foreign minister of Spain who is now the dean of the Paris School of International Affairs at Sciences Po, told me on a panel I moderated at the forum. “It tells us that there is a new world out there.”\n\nPotential sources of finance include development banks located in large emerging economies like Brazil and South Africa. Institutions like the New Development Bank, formed in 2014 by the BRICS nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, have financed billions in clean energy development. And, of course, it’s impossible to talk about this financial picture without talking about China. The country’s Belt and Road Initiative has been a source of more than $1 trillion in capital for infrastructure since its inception in 2013. In recent years, the country has increasingly focused its funding on green projects. Many developing countries have also focused on raising capital locally to fund projects—pushing savings and pension fund money to invest in the local market rather than looking abroad for higher returns. And then there are the new methods of what is often called blended finance. Traditionally, the term refers to a combination of public and private capital where the public money lowers the risk for private investors. More recently, philanthropy has entered the blended finance conversation, playing an increasingly important role providing money\n\n“We have what we call strange bedfellows, where… institutional investors are partnering with a philanthropic organization, and together coming up with a blended finance solution that is innovative in approach,” says Ije Ikoku Okeke, who runs catalytic climate capital for the Global South at RMI, a clean energy non-profit. A right-wing populist might not object to this new dynamic. In such a world view, American money should support Americans—leaving other countries to their own devices. But is the U.S. really better off if the rest of the world builds a coalition with Americans on the sidelines? Putting U.S. strategic interests aside, it is a little refreshing to hear a conversation about clean energy in the Global South that doesn’t get bogged down in whether the U.S. is going to live up to its moral responsibility as the world’s biggest historic emitter and instead focuses on solutions.\n\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.\n\nTIME receives support for climate coverage from the Outrider Foundation.

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to eliminate its scientific research office and could fire more than 1,000 scientists and other employees who help provide the scientific foundation for rules safeguarding human health and ecosystems from environmental pollutants. As many as 1,155 chemists, biologists, toxicologists and other scientists — 75% of the research program's staff — could be laid off, according to documents reviewed by Democratic staff on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe planned layoffs, cast by the Trump administration as part of a broader push to shrink the size of the federal government and make it more efficient, were assailed by critics as a massive dismantling of the EPA's longstanding mission to protect public health and the environment. The plans were first reported by The New York Times. Read more: Here Are All of Trump’s Major Moves to Dismantle Climate Action EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said he wants to eliminate 65% of the agency’s budget, a huge spending cut that would require major staffing reductions for jobs such as monitoring air and water quality, responding to natural disasters and lead abatement, among many other agency functions. The EPA has also issued guidance directing that spending items greater than $50,000 require approval from billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. The Office of Research and Development — EPA's main science arm — currently has 1,540 positions, excluding special government employees and public health officers, according to the memo. A majority of staff — ranging from 50% to 75% — \"will not be retained,'' the memo said.\n\nThe plan calls for dissolving the research office and reassigning remaining staff to other parts of the agency “to provide increased oversight and align with administration priorities,\" the memo says. EPA officials have presented the plan to the White House for review. Molly Vaseliou, an EPA spokeswoman, said the agency “is taking exciting steps as we enter the next phase of organizational improvements,” but said changes had not been finalized. “We are committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water and land for all Americans,” she said, adding, “While no decisions have been made yet, we are actively listening to employees at all levels to gather ideas on how to increase efficiency and ensure the EPA is as up to date and effective as ever.” California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the science committee, said in a statement that the agency's research office was created by Congress and “eliminating it is illegal.”\n\nRead more: What Legal Experts Say About Trump’s Sweeping EPA Deregulation\n\nEvery decision the EPA makes “must be in furtherance of protecting human health and the environment, and that just can’t happen if you gut EPA science,” Lofgren said.\n\n“EPA cannot meet its legal obligation to use the best available science without (the Office of Research and Development) and that’s the point,'' she added. President Donald Trump and his adviser, Musk , “are putting their polluter buddies’ bottom lines over the health and safety of Americans,” Lofgren said.\n\nIn his first term, “Trump and his cronies politicized and distorted science,'' she said. “Now, this is their attempt to kill it for good.\"\n\nTicora Jones, chief science officer at the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, said Trump's EPA “yet again is putting polluters over people.\"\n\nShe called on Congress to “stand up and demand that EPA keep its scientists on the beat so that we all can get the clean air and clean water we need and deserve.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\n\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\n\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\n\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\n\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\n\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\n\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”",

        "title": "Matt Damon: The Key to Solving the Global Water Crisis",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The global water crisis is one of the most urgent and complex challenges facing humanity today. More than 2.2 billion people lack access to safe water, and 3.5 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation. This crisis undermines health and safety, education, and economic opportunity. For communities already struggling, the consequences are devastating: children miss school, women spend hours each day collecting water, and families face increased exposure to waterborne diseases.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen we talk about the global water crisis, we often focus on water scarcity. However, in many regions, even where water is available, access can be unreliable and unaffordable. And for the billions of people who live without safely managed water and sanitation, this lack leads to contaminated water sources, and also undermines public health, reduces financial stability, and perpetuates cycles of poverty. These challenges are exacerbated due to rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and extreme weather events intensifying water scarcity and disrupting fragile systems, leaving families—particularly those in poverty—without reliable access to safe water. In cities like Mexico City, groundwater depletion and erratic weather patterns make water trucks a daily necessity. Without resilient infrastructure, communities face compromised water quality, greater exposure to disease, and limited economic opportunities. Investing in sustainable water solutions is essential to address immediate needs, safeguard public health, and reduce the escalating costs of climate-related challenges.\n\nRead More: The Water Crisis No One In America Is Fixing Achieving safely managed water and sanitation for all by 2030 requires an estimated $114 billion per year, starting in 2016. Yet, with only $28.4 billion currently being invested annually, a staggering $85.6 billion gap remains—one that keeps millions of families without access to these essential resources. This shortfall isn’t just a funding issue; it’s the single biggest barrier to solving the global water crisis. Traditional aid alone is not enough to bridge this divide. To close the gap, we must mobilize the full spectrum of capital—philanthropy to innovate and prove solutions, and investment capital to scale them. By harnessing market-driven approaches, we can accelerate access to safe water and sanitation, transforming millions of lives and unlocking improved health, access to education and jobs, and opportunities for families around the world to define their futures.\n\nWe must close this gap. Doing so would both advance progress toward universal access to water and sanitation and unlock significant economic benefits. According to the World Bank, every $1 invested in water and sanitation yields a $4 economic return, driven by reduced health-care costs, increased workforce productivity, and lower mortality rates. For too long, capital has been viewed in silos—philanthropy on one side and investment on the other. Today, we recognize capital as a spectrum, from charitable contributions to impact-driven investments with both risk and potential returns. Philanthropy can address market failures and lay the groundwork for scalable solutions, while investments follow to drive growth. This spectrum is particularly critical in solving the water and sanitation crisis, where engagement at every level is needed to create sustainable impact. Philanthropy plays a catalytic role by empowering local financial institutions to serve families in need. It helps build markets and strengthen institutional capacity, enabling the development of affordable loan products for water and sanitation solutions. This foundation attracts impact investors, who bring additional capital to expand these efforts and meet growing demand. Together, philanthropic and private investments create a sustainable cycle: loans are repaid, markets grow, and millions of families gain access to safe water resulting in improved health, resilience, and financial stability.\n\nThe global water crisis disproportionately affects women and girls, who spend 200 million hours collecting water. In many regions, this time-consuming task prevents them from fully participating in education or income-generating activities, caring for family, and achieving their potential. Through our work with Water.org and Water Equity, we’ve seen countless examples of the impact even small, individual investments can make. Zipporah, a small-scale farmer from Kenya, took out a loan to install a rainwater collection tank, allowing her to balance her farming with her education and reducing the time it takes to source water for her family. Now studying to become a nurse, Zipporah plans to open a clinic in her community and take out another loan to ensure her clinic has a reliable water supply. Stories like this demonstrate how the right blend of philanthropic and investment capital can accelerate progress by making life-changing solutions available today while also laying a foundation for long-term growth. By harnessing the full spectrum of capital, we can scale this proven approach to reach more people faster, creating lasting impacts for families and communities. Solutions like these improve health and education outcomes, empower women, and enable families to thrive, transforming their futures.\n\nThe global water crisis is one of the most urgent challenges of our time. And solutions exist today. By closing the $85.6 billion annual financing gap, leveraging the full spectrum of capital, and scaling sustainable access to safe water and sanitation, we can unlock profound social and economic benefits.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The standoff at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue was not much of a spectacle. On the first day of February, a handful of men working for Elon Musk had come to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a few blocks from the White House, demanding full access to its headquarters. The agency’s staff refused. No guns were drawn. No punches thrown. Nobody involved the police. But in these early days of the Trump Administration, perhaps no other scene revealed more clearly the forces reshaping America’s government.\n\nOn one side stood an institution with a 64-year history, a $35 billion budget, and a mission enshrined in federal law. On the other stood Musk’s political wrecking crew. They identified themselves as members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a collection of temporary staffers with no charter, no website, and no clear legal authority. Its power derives from Musk, the wealthiest person on the planet, who has been deputized to dismantle vast swaths of the federal bureaucracy—slashing budgets, gutting the civil service, and stripping independent agencies of the ability to impede the President’s objectives.\n\nUSAID leadership had allowed Musk’s team, a group of his young and eager followers, to spend several days inside their headquarters at the end of January. “The DOGE kids,” as some of the staffers called them in private, walked the halls with clipboards in their hands, examining desks and questioning managers, according to several USAID officials who described the events to TIME. But as the weekend arrived, their demands—including access to sensitive facilities designed to store classified information—went too far for the agency’s heads of security. The men from DOGE threatened to call the U.S. Marshals and have them clear the building. They also informed Musk about the problem. “USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote to his 215 million followers on his social media platform, X, soon after. “Time for it to die.”\n\nThe cause of Musk’s crusade remained unclear. But regardless of the reason, by the following morning, an agency that annually disburses tens of billions of dollars across the globe, fighting famine and disease and bringing clean water to millions, had mostly ceased to function. Within a week, nearly all its staff were placed on leave, its offices around the world shut down.\n\nPhoto-Illustration by TIME (Source Photos: Chip Somodevilla—Getty Images; Anna Moneymaker—Getty Images)\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nEvery other government bureau got the message loud and clear. No single private citizen, certainly not one whose wealth and web of businesses are directly subject to the oversight of federal authorities, has wielded such power over the machinery of the U.S. government. So far, Musk appears accountable to no one but President Trump, who handed his campaign benefactor a sweeping mandate to bring the government in line with his agenda. DOGE directed all of TIME’s questions about its work to the White House, which declined to comment.\n\nRead More: How Elon Musk Became a Kingmaker.\n\nAlready, the DOGE team has taken over the U.S. Digital Service and established a beachhead within the federal human-resources department, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Education Department is on edge, fearing a self-decapitation mandate is in the offing. Few agencies seem safe. Musk has shown that he will tolerate no opposition, no matter how justified. Days before the drama at USAID, a Treasury official refused DOGE access to the U.S. federal payment system. The official was forced to retire, and the newly appointed Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, gave DOGE the access it demanded. The Administration agreed on Feb. 5 to restrict that access, at least temporarily, after a group of past and present employees sued.\n\nThese are just the first ripples in a massive antigovernment wave. Budgets will be hacked. Valuable programs will be eliminated. Career civil servants will be purged, replaced with political appointees whose primary qualification is apparent fealty to the President. This is the course the electorate chose. And to many, the idea of one of the world’s most accomplished entrepreneurs attacking a sprawling, sclerotic federal bureaucracy with the same velocity and determination he brought to his car startup or rocket company is cause for celebration, not alarm. “The federal government is so big that there are surely significant opportunities for saving and efficiency,” says Robert Doar, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. “The fact that the President and his team is giving this a lot of attention is a good thing.”\n\nBut a public backlash may be growing to Musk’s mission, and far more is at stake than the size of the federal balance sheet, the head count at agencies inside the Beltway, or the dangers of one unelected man possessing such unconstrained power. Soon Americans are going to learn where they interact with the federal government in ways they didn’t realize or took for granted. Companies that export tech products to China may no longer have State or Commerce Department employees available to explain, for free, how to avoid violating criminal law. Farmers in the Midwest may soon find USAID-funded buyers no longer paying for sacks of flour to send to refugee camps. Around the world, millions of people who depend on the U.S. for food, medicine, and shelter are suddenly on their own.\n\nRead More: Why TIME Chose Musk As 2021 Person of the Year.\n\nFor now, millions of government workers find themselves at Musk’s mercy. One described her team at the Department of Homeland Security assuming a “defensive crouch” as they awaited a visit from the DOGE. For an inkling of their fate, she added, her colleagues had turned to a book called Character Limit, which chronicles the way Musk took over Twitter two years ago and fired 80% of its staff, often with chaotic and lasting results.\n\nThe similarities to his assault on the bureaucracy have been uncanny. On Jan. 28, millions of civil servants across government received an email offering them eight months’ pay in exchange for their resignation. Musk had proposed much the same deal to Twitter’s employees two years earlier. He even used the same subject line: “Fork in the road.”\n\nNone of this came without warning. Among Musk’s friends in Silicon Valley, many understood his takeover of Twitter as preparation for a greater cause. “The mood is that hopefully Musk can do the same thing with the U.S. government,” one told TIME in November. Veterans of Trump’s first Administration likewise laid out their plans long before the elections, publishing a 900-page report known as Project 2025. One of its lead authors, Russell Vought, said in a speech two years ago that he wanted civil servants to be “traumatically affected” by the purge he envisioned. “We want their funding to be shut,” he said. “We want to put them in trauma.”\n\nRussell Vought, Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, at a confirmation hearing on Jan. 15. Andrew Harnik—Getty Images\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump swore he had nothing to do with the plan. “It was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that,” he told TIME in November. “Some things I vehemently disagreed with.” But once in office, he picked Vought to be in charge of the White House Office of Management and Budget, which now works closely with Musk to enact crucial parts of Project 2025. So far, the frenetic opening moves of the Trump presidency have tracked nearly two-thirds of its prescriptions, according to a TIME analysis.\n\nMusk never hid his intentions. Two weeks after the election, he co-wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal that promised DOGE would help Trump “hire a lean team of small-government crusaders,” who would work to bring “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” That recruitment drive began soon after the elections, drawing from Musk’s acolytes in Silicon Valley, some barely out of college, and priming them to fan out across Washington.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk's Struggle For the Future of AI.\n\nThe man Musk put in charge of staffing at DOGE was an aerospace engineer named Steve Davis, who previously led his cost-cutting efforts at Twitter. In late December, as the presidential transition unfolded inside the White House, Davis took part in a series of meetings with members of the Biden Administration. The Democratic staffers noted his fixation with an obscure branch of the White House called the U.S. Digital Service. Davis wanted to know how it operated, who it reported to, and what it could access.\n\nCreated in 2014, the USDS works with federal agencies to improve computer systems and databases. It houses a map of the government’s technology infrastructure and has contact points for the technology officer at nearly every federal agency. That made it the perfect place to host the DOGE. If Musk wanted to wither the limbs of the federal government, the USDS provided the veins that would let the poison flow.\n\nThe empowerment of USDS started on Inauguration Day. One of Trump’s first Executive Orders renamed it “the United States DOGE Service,” neatly preserving the office’s acronym. The order also ensured that the new entity would report directly to the White House chief of staff. Since then, the office has set up shop inside the Departments of State and Treasury. It began accessing personnel computer systems, firing contractors, and blocking payments on their contracts.\n\nMusk also sent a team to OPM. The office holds records on 2.1 million workers, the email address for nearly every federal employee, and tracks $59 billion per year in federal health care premiums and $88 billion per year in payments to federal retirees. The mass buyout offer to government employees originated from within Musk’s team at OPM, according to a source familiar with those actions. (Both DOGE and the White House declined to comment.)\n\nRead More: As Musk's DOGE Targets Federal Data, This Obscure Office Is at the Center\n\nNext, the DOGE team set to starving OPM itself. Brian Bjelde, who recently worked as vice president of human resources at Musk’s aerospace firm, told career supervisors at OPM that the “target” was to slash 70% of its staff, a move that would hobble its health care benefits and retirement-planning teams, says a current OPM official. Some senior leaders at OPM have been locked out of key databases, the official says, and political appointees have access to systems, including the Enterprise Human Resources Integration, without standard safeguard procedures designed to keep such information private. That system includes information like pay grades, length of service, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and home addresses.\n\nDays after Trump took office, the White House ordered a freeze on federal spending—from foreign aid to public-health programs, and everything in between. It would be lifted, the Administration said, as agencies fell in line with the President’s agenda: cracking down on immigration, ending diversity efforts, and stopping investments that reduce the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Facing a court’s action, the White House rolled back the order.\n\nA protest outside the U.S. Treasury building in Washington, D.C., on Feb 4. Stefani Reynolds—Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk’s downsizing pressed ahead, and Trump continued to give his blessing. “Elon can’t do—and won’t do—anything without our approval,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 4. “We’ll give him the approval where appropriate,” he added. “Where not appropriate, we won’t.” Some took it as a sign that Trump might rein in his attack dog. But civil servants are not waiting around for that to happen. In Northern Virginia, home to tens of thousands of workers on the federal payroll and military service members, the typical town-hall meeting in the town of Leesburg attracts a few dozen people. Hundreds gathered on the night Musk shut down USAID. “We’re hearing bizarre stories,” says Representative Suhas Subramanyam, the local Democratic Congressman who spoke at the event. His office has been flooded with workers describing DOGE’s takeover, and he instructed his staff to log their testimony and assist whistle-blowers. Much of what they witnessed is “simply illegal,” Subramanyam insists to TIME. “We’re almost being tested and dared to sue or investigate.”\n\nRead More: Across Pennsylvania, Musk Deploys His Fame and Fortune For Trump.\n\nSome lawsuits have worked. The White House complied with court orders blocking its attempt to freeze trillions of dollars in federal spending. A judge’s ruling on Feb. 6 delayed the deadline for the buyout offer to government employees. Unions have filed suits related to DOGE on behalf of federal workers. Even Musk’s usual admirers have warned he is overreaching. “The lawsuits are already flying,” a Feb. 4 Wall Street Journal editorial noted, “and courts will derail Mr. Musk’s project before it even gets off the ground if he isn’t careful.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Musk’s assault on the bureaucracy has set up a battle with Democrats that could determine the future of the government and the balance of power within it. “We don’t have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,” Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin told a crowd outside USAID on the afternoon of Feb. 3, while the men from DOGE tried to impose their demands inside.\n\nRaskin was right. But the agency staffers listening to him on Pennsylvania Avenue, unsure of whether they still had a job, could not tell how much power Musk had acquired, and whether he would bend the other branches of government to his will. One staffer seemed especially skeptical. Yes, she told TIME, the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse. But Musk had shown his power to yank it away.\n\n“There’s only so much Democrats can do,” she said, not wanting to give her name lest it attract more attention from DOGE. Her official email account had been shut down, and she could no longer access her desk at the agency. Like thousands of her colleagues, and millions of Americans, she was left to watch Musk’s moves play out, wondering how far he would go, and what, if anything, could stop him. —With reporting by Eric Cortellessa, Philip Elliott, Nik Popli, and Tessa Berenson Rogers/Washington",

        "content": "Why is it that one high school student aces her SAT verbal section while another barely finishes the exam, scoring near the bottom of the heap? Some would say that the teenager with the high score probably benefited from an advantageous environment, parents who could afford books and who read to her as a young child, instilling a lifelong passion for all things literary. The low-scoring adolescent may not have enjoyed those same advantages and may have experienced stress due to poverty. Those who subscribe to this theory–many of whom lean left–might go so far as to say that gaps like this one are why we need more policies like universal preschool and a stronger safety net for children.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOthers, meanwhile, would say that regardless of those environmental differences, the test-score gap between the two students was probably already baked into their genes. The top scorer just had natural talents from birth, and while it may not be fair, there’s not much we can do about it. For decades, scientists have argued over whether our genes (nature) or our environment (nurture) shapes who we are. It’s one of the longest-running debates in human sciences. Are we born with certain abilities, personalities, and destinies already programmed in? Or do our experiences—the schools we attend, the books we read, the people we meet—mold us into who we become? Which one matters more? Psychologists have spent over 50 years studying this, tracking twins raised apart, adoptees, and half-siblings to estimate how much of various traits are genetic. The big takeaway? On average, human traits are about half genetic and half environmental. Height, for example, is about 80% genetic in developed countries. Personality traits are on the lower end: Around 20% heritable. Educational attainment? About 40% inherited. And when it comes to reading ability—i.e. verbal test scores—it turns out that by age 18, it’s over 80% heritable.\n\nIt would seem like the hereditarians won the debate with respect to the case of the verbal SAT section and that differences in the population are mostly due to genetics. But that framing—the idea of nature versus nurture—is all wrong. Just because some trait—like reading—is highly heritable doesn’t mean the environment doesn’t matter, it just means the environment matters in a certain way. That’s one of the insights of a new field called sociogenomics. Instead of nature competing with nurture, sociogenomics shows how genes and environment interact in ways we never fully appreciated before. Your DNA isn’t a rigid blueprint dictating your fate, and your environment isn’t just some separate force shaping you independently. Instead, genes work through the environment. Scientists have long known that nature and nurture mutually reinforce each other. But what’s new here—in the past decade, when the genomics revolution has brought oodles of data to human scientists—is that we can now study exactly how the genes for, say, reading ability, are distributed across society and how they work their magic by creating or evoking environmental conditions and responses.\n\nIt’s common sense that kids who get read to a lot tend to have better verbal skills. But why do some kids get more bedtime stories than others? Is it just luck—having parents who love books? Not quite. Kids with an innate genetic tendency toward high verbal ability naturally receive more words. They may beg for “one more story” before bed, show an early fascination with books, and develop a hunger for language. In turn, their parents—whether consciously or not—respond to this interest by reading to them more. Over time, this extra exposure leads to even better verbal skills. It’s a cycle: genes create tendencies, which shape experiences, which reinforce those same genetic tendencies. This cycle starts very early. A study that Asta Breinholt and I conducted showed that parents unknowingly invest more time and resources in kids who show early academic promise. If two average parents (say, both at the 50th percentile for genetic educational potential) happen to have a child who scores in the 60th percentile for genetic educational potential, they notice. That child, compared to a sibling who might be in the 40th percentile, gets more attention, more books, more educational experiences—as early as 18 months of age, long before any report cards have come home informing mom and dad about their kid’s talents or deficits. And then what happens? The child who was already slightly above average genetically likely ends up doing even better in school (and on the SATs)—not because the genes alone dictated success, but because those genes nudged the environment in their favor.\n\nThis means that much of what we think of as environmental is partly genes in action. A child’s genetic potential influences how parents treat them before they can even speak. And the effects can snowball—small genetic advantages may turn into big differences over time, thanks to the way the environment reacts. But that also means that genes are not destiny: If the environment niches they carve out are an important step from DNA to SAT verbal scores, then we can act on those environments for those with advantageous or disadvantageous genes. We can, for example, make sure that a kid with a high genetic risk for addiction stays away from opioids for pain management. In short, if we gain an understanding of someone’s genetic propensities, we may be able to adjust the environment in the way that most benefits them. Of course it’s not always so simple. Genes need certain environmental inputs that they seek out in order to have their effects. If that environmental feedback is blocked, due to poverty, racism, or other forces outside the control of, for instance, an individual parent, then genetic tendencies cannot be reinforced. So, even if a child has a high genetic propensity for reading ability, without the environmental element, that 80% heritability figure for verbal skills is moot.\n\nOne of the best ways to think about how all this works is to move beyond the outdated “blueprint” analogy for DNA, in which DNA is a rigid set of instructions dictating who we become. Instead imagine your brain as a machine-learning model. Your genes set the parameters—how quickly you learn, what interests you, what behaviors you’re inclined toward. But just like an algorithm, you need training data. Your experiences, social interactions, and education all feed into this system. The more exposure you have to different ideas, the more refined your \"model\" becomes. Someone who’s genetically inclined toward curiosity will seek out more information, explore new ideas, and continuously refine their worldview. Meanwhile, a genetically cautious person might be more selective about new experiences, filtering their environment differently. Over time, these genetic tendencies get reinforced by the environments we shape for ourselves. The curious kid seeks out books and interesting conversations, further sharpening their mind. The risk-averse person builds a life with stability and routine. As Joyce Carol Oates once said: “I don’t change; I become more myself.”\n\nWe can see Oates’ insight in the data. When we measure something like intelligence, we find that the genetic component becomes more predictive as we age into adulthood. At age 5, the genetic component is 45%, but by age 35, it has ballooned to 80%. As for verbal ability, the heritability rises from 48% at age 5 to over 70% by the time a kid takes the SAT. We can see a similar pattern with political views. Indeed, many, but not all, social and behavioral traits work this way. It’s like a fuzzy picture coming into focus—but that’s only made possible by “training” with our environmental interlocutors. What’s amazing is that the more we are exposed to the environment by living longer, the less the random aspects of the environment matter–the noise, so to speak–and the more our genes matter, picking and choosing the specific environmental information they incorporate into our brains. This perspective fundamentally changes how we think about human development. It’s no longer about whether nature or nurture \"wins\"—because they’re not actually in competition. Instead, genetics and environment work in a dynamic loop, each shaping the other in constant, invisible, and powerful ways that ripple across our lives.\n\nConley is the author of The Social Genome: The New Science of Nature and Nurture",

        "content": "Dr. Frank Frizelle has operated on countless patients in his career as a colorectal surgeon. But there’s one case that stayed with him.\n\nIn 2014, he was treating a woman in her late 20s suffering from bowel cancer—already a rare situation, given her age. But it became even more unusual when her best friend visited her in the hospital and told Frizelle that she had many of the same symptoms as his patient. Subsequent testing revealed that his patient’s friend had a lesion that, had it not been caught early, likely would have become cancerous. “That really brought it home to me—how it’s much more common than you think,” says Frizelle, a professor of surgery at the University of Otago in New Zealand.\n\nStill, like any good scientist, Frizelle was skeptical. Was it simply a fluke that he kept treating strikingly young patients? Or was his practice one tiny data point in a larger trend?\n\nHe found his answer after sifting through national health data: colorectal cancer, he discovered, was indeed being diagnosed more often than in previous years among New Zealanders under 50. Further research by Frizelle analyzing populations in Sweden and Scotland showed the same thing. A bigger picture was emerging. Here were three different countries, with different populations and health challenges—but united by a spike in colorectal cancers among young adults.\n\nPhotograph by Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nIn the years since, it’s become clear that the problem isn’t limited to those three countries, nor to colorectal cancer. Researchers have found that young people around the world are getting many different kinds of cancer at alarmingly high rates. And as the diagnoses of celebrities and public figures like Kate Middleton, Chadwick Boseman, Dwyane Wade, and Olivia Munn bring mass attention to the issue, scientists are racing to answer a question on the minds of many outside the medical profession: Why is cancer, historically a disease of old age, increasingly striking people in the primes of their lives?\n\nGlobally, diagnoses and deaths related to early-onset cancers—those affecting patients younger than 50—rose by 79% and 28%, respectively, from 1990 to 2019, according to a recent study published in the medical journal BMJ Oncology. In the U.S., breast cancer is the most common type of early-onset disease, but recent surges in cancers affecting digestive organs—including the colon, rectum, pancreas, and stomach—are particularly dramatic within this age group. In fact, today’s young adults are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer—and four times as likely to be diagnosed with rectal cancer—as those born around 1950, research suggests.\n\nRead More: The Unique Hell of Getting Cancer as a Young Adult\n\nOverall, cancer is still overwhelmingly an older person’s disease. As of 2025, 88% of people in the U.S. diagnosed with cancer were 50 or older, and 59% were 65 or older, according to data from the American Cancer Society. But there is no question that the demographics are shifting. Under 50s are not only at increasing risk of suffering from cancer; theirs is the only age group for which the risk is rising. All told, 17 types of cancer are on the rise among U.S. adults in this age group.\n\n“When we were younger, we assumed the climate would be the same forever. The same applies in cancer,” says Dr. Thomas Powles, a U.K.-based oncologist and cancer researcher who edits the journal Annals of Oncology. “We just assumed that cancer incidence was something that is relatively static. But it’s not.”\n\nThere is some good news in the data. Advances in disease detection and treatment, as well as dramatic declines in smoking, mean that far fewer people die from cancer now than once did. Although the disease still ranks as the second most common cause of death in the U.S., killing more than half a million people each year, mortality rates have dropped by about a third since 1991.\n\nLess encouragingly, the rate of new cancers diagnosed has remained stubbornly consistent, declining only modestly from 1999 to 2021. Across the U.S., roughly 2 million new cancer cases are detected each year, diagnoses that, on top of the emotional toll, force patients to cumulatively fork out billions of dollars in out-of-pocket costs—more than $16 billion in 2019 alone, according to federal data. Today, about 40 out of every 100 U.S. adults can expect to be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetimes. For an estimated 1 in 17 U.S. women and 1 in 29 U.S. men, that news will come before their 50th birthdays.\n\nThe rise in early-onset diagnoses partly comes down to advances in our ability to detect and diagnose different kinds of cancers. “With much more sophisticated tools now, inevitably we’re doing more tests on younger people [and] we’re using more accurate imaging,” which leads to more cancers detected, Powles says. Some screening protocols have also been modified in recent years to include younger adults; since 2018, for example, the American Cancer Society has recommended colonoscopies starting at age 45, down from 50.\n\nRead More: Some Early Forms of Breast Cancer May Not Need Treatment, Study Says\n\nBut this is only one part of what scientists say is a more complex web of factors they are still attempting to understand. The data suggest that some element—or perhaps combination of elements—of modern life is sickening progressively younger adults. And right now, no one knows for sure what that is.\n\nThere are plenty of known risk factors for cancer, from the genes someone is born with to the unhealthy lifestyle habits they pick up, such as smoking, drinking lots of alcohol, or spending time in the sun. Such habits can speed up the natural degradation of cells, which over time acquire genetic mutations as they lose their ability to repair damage. As that damage accumulates with age, cells may become cancerous, growing and -multiplying too fast for the body’s immune system to keep them in check and potentially choking out vital organs. The immune system also loses some of its strength with age, making it easier for cancer cells to colonize the body.\n\nBut classic risk factors do not seem to fully explain the recent rise in early-onset cancers, says Dr. Cathy Eng, director of the Young Adult Cancers Program at Vanderbilt University’s Ingram Cancer Center in Tennessee. Some of the trends are baffling; young, nonsmoking women, for example, are being diagnosed with lung cancer in strangely high numbers. Many times, Eng’s patients were extremely healthy: vegetarians, marathon runners, avid swimmers. “That’s why I really believe there’s other risk factors to account for this,” she says.\n\nKelly Spill, 33, was initially brushed aside by doctors who thought her cancer symptoms were related to pregnancy and birth. “If you don’t find your answers, keep pushing for them,” Spill says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nThere’s no shortage of theories about what those may be. Many scientists point to modern diets, which tend to be heavy on potentially carcinogenic products—including ultra-processed foods, red meat, and alcohol—and may also contribute to weight gain, another cancer risk factor. The foods we eat can also affect the gut microbiome, the colony of microbes that lives in the digestive system and appears linked to overall health. Alterations to the gut microbiome via diet, or perhaps exposure to drugs like antibiotics, have also been implicated.\n\nOther researchers blame the microplastics littering our environment and leaching into our food and water supplies, some of which, according to a 2024 study, have even shown up in cancer patients’ tumors. Other environmental factors could also be to blame, given that everything from cosmetics to food packaging contains substances that many researchers aren’t convinced are safe. Even our near constant exposure to artificial light could be messing with normal biological rhythms in ways that have profound health consequences, some research suggests.\n\nFor now, these are all just hypotheses. Some may turn out to be wrong, and more theories will emerge in time. It’s also likely that different risk factors are linked to different cancers, Frizelle says. Even in a single patient, multiple overlapping triggers may be in play.\n\nFrizelle’s research on colorectal cancer, for example, suggests there may be a dysfunctional relationship between microplastics, certain foods, and some types of gut bacteria. Studies suggest that when microplastics get into the body, they can penetrate the mucous lining that protects the bowels and carry bacteria and toxins to the bowel lining. This leaves the bowel more susceptible to damage from pathogens inside the body—including strains of gut bacteria that are known to become more virulent when they interact with compounds found in red and processed meat. In some patients, this perfect storm of invaders may result in cancer, Frizelle thinks.\n\nRead More: CNN’s Sara Sidner Is Demystifying Breast Cancer Treatment\n\nHe believes this overlapping puzzle of risk factors is a likelier explanation than any one lifestyle habit driving a dramatic uptick in cancers—especially since younger generations are, in many respects, healthier than their ancestors. In the U.S., for example, tobacco use has plummeted in recent decades, and young adults are increasingly unlikely to drink. “How is the health-conscious generation getting more bowel cancer?” Frizelle asks.\n\nDr. Andrea Cercek, co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, agrees that some early-onset cancer cases defy easy explanation. She’s treated patients in their 20s and even teens with tumors that, biologically, “look just like a regular 80-year-old’s tumor.” These cases stump her. “Even if they drank as a teenager, it just doesn’t make sense,” she says. A few years of drinking alcohol, following an unhealthy diet, or having obesity should not be enough to produce the kind of tumor typically seen in a senior citizen, Cercek says. And yet, there they are.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, credits his Christian faith with helping him live with lung cancer for more than a decade. “When I was first diagnosed, I was searching on Google for anybody who was a survivor, and I couldn’t find no one,” he says. “There is hope. There are people who are living long and having a great quality of life.” Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nTo Cercek, these advanced tumors suggest that people have been exposed to damaging substances for a long time, perhaps even longer than they were aware of. Research and awareness about early-onset cancer is accumulating now, but the source of the problem may not be new, Cercek says. It can take years for even the most toxic exposures to result in health problems—which means that the source of a problem in the public eye now may have emerged decades ago, silently sickening people until the trend became too pronounced to ignore.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, is one of many patients whose cancer defies obvious explanation. When he was in high school, Oviedo-Mori developed a persistent cough that didn’t respond to medication. Eventually, at just 18 years old, he was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer.\n\nOviedo-Mori and his doctors were stunned. He’d had asthma as a child growing up in Peru, but he had no family history of cancer and had never been a drinker or smoker; he was barely even old enough to buy cigarettes and still years shy of his 21st birthday. Oviedo-Mori’s family spent a day observing the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack when toxic particles were still in the air, but it had been a brief visit and no one else in the family had developed health problems. That was the only exposure he could think of. The diagnosis didn’t make sense. “It was so weird,” he says.\n\nRead More: 4 Important Steps to Take After a Cancer Diagnosis\n\nAs he went through cancer treatment—including chemotherapy, radiation, and a surgery that removed his entire left lung—he’d look at his fellow patients, and, seeing how much older they were, feel out of place. “I didn’t belong there,” he says.\n\nMore than a decade later, Oviedo-Mori is still in treatment, participating in a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering (where all the patients pictured in this article have received care) in hopes of ridding his body of cancer for good. But, though he’s still fighting cancer, he is in good health—he can even play soccer, despite having only one lung, and chase after his almost 2-year-old son. “Sometimes, I don’t believe it,” he says. “I think about [my son] and I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re really a miracle.’”\n\nFiguring out how young people like Oviedo-Mori fall prey to cancer is not easy, given the sheer number of potential health hazards in the modern world. It is a puzzle with an unknown number of pieces—one that Dr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is trying to solve with a technique he pioneered.\n\nDr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is studying early-onset cancer using a unique approach that combines epidemiology (the study of population-level health trends) and molecular pathology (the granular analysis of a patient’s tumor). He believes this unlikely pairing will help uncover triggers for early-onset disease. Sophie Park for TIME\n\nOgino and his team are making their way through about 4,000 colorectal tumor samples that came from people who developed the disease at various points in their lives. Each sliver of tissue holds innumerable clues about the person it belonged to, from what they ate and drank to the bacteria that lived in their body before cancer took root. To unearth these clues, the researchers stain the tissues, so that under the lens of a powerful microscope, they can see the different types of cells in the tumor in brilliant color. Using these cell-level insights, they can distinguish between the tumors of young vs. older patients and—with the help of AI—search reams of scientific literature for environmental exposures, lifestyle habits, or health conditions linked to particular cellular traits. Repeating this painstaking detective work enough times helps reveal patterns among young cancer patients, giving Ogino and his team clues as to what may have caused their diseases.\n\nTheir research has already pointed to some possible answers for early-onset colorectal cancer. The big three so far are eating a typical Western diet (high in sugar, processed foods, and red meat, low in fresh produce), developing insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes also linked to poor diet), and having a particular type of E. coli bacteria in the gut. Nothing is proven yet, Ogino says. But since there’s no harm in eating healthfully, he believes dietary changes are worth making now.\n\nOgino personally drinks very little and eats a healthy diet. He makes sure his young son eats well too, since his research makes him acutely aware of the importance of developing healthy habits starting from a very young age. But even for children as young as Ogino’s son, some damage may already be done—at least according to Dr. George Barreto, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Flinders University in South Australia.\n\nRead More: 8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety\n\nBarreto—who started researching early-onset cancer after not just his patients, but also several of his relatives and friends, were diagnosed at young ages—has theorized that damage may start in the womb. It’s well established that the pre-natal period can have long-term effects on a baby’s health, and Barreto believes that phenomenon may extend to cancer risk if parents are exposed to carcinogens during this critical developmental time. This theory could help explain mysterious cases like those Cercek describes, involving patients who seemingly haven’t lived long enough for even their riskiest habits to catch up with them.\n\nProving his theory won’t be simple, Barreto acknowledges. It would require collecting data on huge numbers of people, starting before they were even born, then sifting through that data to pinpoint relevant prenatal and early-life triggers. To speed up the process, Barreto has contacted more than 20 research groups around the world that are tracking groups of people beginning at or before birth, in hopes of using their data to jump-start his research. “If we start [from scratch] now, it will take us 40 years to find answers,” Barreto says. That’s too long to wait, with patients already getting sick at an alarming rate.\n\nThere is yet another question for researchers to answer: whether, on a molecular level, young patients’ cancers are dramatically different from those that occur in older people. If so, these findings may guide researchers toward new treatment approaches.\n\nSome research, including by Eng, has pointed to molecular differences, at least among patients with early-onset colorectal disease. But other scientists are less convinced. Powles, the U.K. oncologist, says he hasn’t seen strong evidence to suggest that early-onset cancers are much different or more aggressive than later-in-life cancers; they just happen to strike patients at younger ages.\n\nCarrie Regan, 41, went to the ER in 2023 because of stomach pain, which led to an ovarian cancer diagnosis. Regan is now in good health and is monitored for recurrence. She wants other women to be vigilant about their health, since ovarian cancer symptoms, like bloating and cramps, are easy to miss. “The day I went to the ER, there was a long wait and I started to feel better. I almost left,” she says. The fact that she didn’t saved her life. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nEven if there is no medical requirement to stray from classic treatment methods—like chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery—younger patients have unique needs. Standard treatments, while often effective, can be destructive for people with decades of life ahead of them, potentially leading to life-altering physical changes, like permanently needing a colostomy bag or enduring early menopause and infertility. “The worst thing [for an oncologist to hear] is, ‘I’m cured and my cancer’s gone, but I wish that I’d just lived with my cancer because living like this isn’t living,’” Cercek says.\n\nKelly Spill was blindsided when she was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer in 2020. She was only 28, had no family history of colorectal cancer, and had recently given birth to her first child. She was even more stunned when she learned that her treatment would force her to permanently use a colostomy bag and leave her unable to carry more children. “That completely broke me,” she says. “I’d always wanted a big family.”\n\nJust before she was set to start chemotherapy, however, a research nurse told her she might be a fit for an experimental trial that Cercek was leading. Cercek was testing a new approach among patients whose tumors had a specific genetic mutation: using intravenous medication to boost their immune systems’ abilities to recognize and attack cancerous cells, ideally sparing patients from chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.\n\nRead More: What to Do If Your Doctor Doesn’t Take Your Symptoms Seriously\n\nDespite all the unknowns that came with participating in a clinical trial, Spill says it was a “no-brainer” to try Cercek’s approach instead of therapies that would leave her with lifelong physical side effects. Her gamble paid off: by her ninth treatment session, her tumor had entirely disappeared. Spill is still cancer-free and expecting her third baby in May.\n\nIn June, Cercek reported that out of 41 rectal cancer patients who completed the full regimen, 100% were cancer-free and required no additional treatment. She is now also studying the method against a variety of different cancers, ranging from stomach to bladder. A patient of any age could benefit from this approach, Cercek says, but it could be particularly impactful for young patients, like Spill, who are desperate to avoid permanent side effects.\n\nEven without novel medical approaches, cancer centers are beginning to recognize that, compared with elderly patients, “adolescents and young adults have very different experiences, and therefore need very different approaches to their treatment,” says Alison Silberman, CEO of Stupid Cancer, a nonprofit that supports young people with the disease. Physical fallout isn’t the only hurdle to overcome, Silberman says. Compared with older patients, young people are more likely to struggle to pay for their care and to develop mental-health issues as a result of it.\n\nSilberman witnessed these challenges when her brother was diagnosed with advanced cancer in his 20s. “He was yanked out of his life,” forced to leave his job and apartment to move back in with their parents, Silberman remembers. Cancer made him grapple with his own mortality, largely on his own. “He was too old to be a pediatric patient, too young to be an adult patient,” she says. “That was very isolating for him.”\n\nImtiaz Hussain, 31, says cancer is seen as “kind of untreatable” in his native Pakistan. He no longer thinks so, after joining a clinical trial run by Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Dr. Andrea Cercek. After just a few months of treatment with an experimental immunotherapy drug, Hussain felt better. Today, he is cancer-free and a father of three. “I was a part of history,” he says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\n“Care of early-onset cancer patients becomes complex even beyond [medicine],” says Dr. Veda Giri, an oncologist and co-director of Yale Cancer Center’s Early Onset Cancer Program in Connecticut. This spring, the program will launch new services meant to address that very problem. Patients in the program will be contacted by coordinators who can help guide them through issues that commonly affect young-adult patients, from ways to preserve fertility to deciding whether to pursue genetic testing or enroll in a clinical trial. Patients can also participate in support groups with others in their age group, in hopes of improving social and mental health. The goal: to “support patients and their families from diagnosis all the way through their cancer journey and beyond into survivorship,” since young adults cured of cancer may have continuing needs for decades to come, Giri says.\n\nThe ultimate goal, of course—and the ultimate win for doctors and researchers working in this field—will be for early-onset cancer centers to be rendered unnecessary. But it likely won’t happen anytime soon. Proponents of sophisticated new artificial-intelligence technologies have raised expectations, promising new tools that could transform cancer research. AI gives scientists the ability to sift through mountains of data with hitherto unimaginable levels of precision. And the hope is that these tools will unlock a cascade of new discoveries—illuminating unrecognized risk factors, for example, and turbocharging the development of new treatments.\n\nBut cancer researchers remain cautious. There is hope, no doubt—but like the legions of scientists grappling with complex medical puzzles in other fields, they are wary of overstating the pace of progress and raising the hopes of patients, even with new technologies at their disposal.\n\n“It will be impossible to design a clinical trial that can test all different possible causes of early-onset cancer,” says Dr. Andrew Chan, director of cancer epidemiology at Mass General Cancer Center. AI and other technologies may help land on those possible causes faster. But to really understand exactly what’s driving the disease and how to stop it, researchers must work slowly and methodically, studying various potential triggers—from diet to alcohol to microplastics—one by one.\n\nRead More: 8 Ways to Shorten Your Wait for a Doctor’s Appointment\n\nChan’s team is starting with a trial that will study whether losing weight with the help of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound affects future cancer risk among people who have survived early-onset cancer and who are overweight. Future research may study the effects of specific dietary changes, he says. But not all potential cancer triggers are as straightforward to modify as weight and diet.\n\nTake microplastics, which Frizelle, the New Zealand surgeon, believes are contributing to early-onset cancer. Frizelle is realistic about their ubiquity. Avoiding them is all but impossible in a world where water supplies are tainted and babies suckle on plastic bottles from their earliest days on earth. Barreto’s research on cancer risk starting in the womb paints an even bleaker picture, suggesting that the deck may be stacked against some people before they are really people at all. (He chooses to see it more optimistically, noting that everyone can still “take the power into their own hands” by avoiding known carcinogens.)\n\nThe upshot of all this: it could take years, if not decades, to sort out what’s causing early diagnoses, and perhaps even more time to figure out how to stop them. What seems so obvious to us now—the conclusion that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, for example—took some 40 years for scientists to solidify. Even once they did, change didn’t happen overnight. Smoking rates have fallen steadily since public-health warnings escalated in the 1960s, but they didn’t plummet all at once. Still, change is possible. Today, smoking is at historic lows, and lung cancer diagnoses have declined with them.\n\nIf the challenge sounds daunting, for researchers like Ogino, from Brigham and Women’s, the complexities are part of the process. He is reminded every day that good science takes as long as it takes. Many of the tumor samples he relies on in his research came from participants enrolled in a study that launched in 1976. The researchers who started it couldn’t have known that, 50 years later, their work would be critical in the quest to reverse the rise of early-onset cancer, Ogino says.\n\n“That’s the kind of legacy you can make in science,” he says. “That’s a great, rewarding way to contribute”—even if it takes a lot of time to get there.",

        "title": "The People Quitting Health Insurance For An Alternative Idea",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "When Geoff Perlman’s 20-year-old son broke his arm in December 2022, the bill was paid by strangers who chipped in to cover the costs. And rather than paying a monthly premium to a health care company, Perlman writes a check each month, never exceeding $420 for his family of four, to foot strangers’ health care bills, covering part of a pregnancy for one family or chemotherapy for another. Perlman, a 61-year-old tech CEO from Austin, Texas, is a member of CrowdHealth, a health care startup that seeks to replace health insurance with a crowd-funding model that the company says lowers costs and diverts money from insurance conglomerates to real people. Perlman likes the company because he says it sidesteps insurers’ incentive to deny claims and seek profit, while erasing patients’ ignorance about what health care actually costs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“You have a feeling you’re part of a community and you’re looking out for them,” says Perlman. “It feels like the money I am paying is helping other people.” CrowdHealth, which was founded in 2021, offers a new take on an old idea. For decades, religious health-sharing ministries with names like Medi-Share and Samaritan Ministries have asked communities to pitch in for the medical bills of strangers. CrowdHealth has no spiritual affiliation; it’s a peer-to-peer financial-technology company that allows its roughly 10,000 paying members to make payments toward fellow members’ medical expenses. To join, members pay an administrative fee of about $55 a month. Each month, they get a message from CrowdHealth informing them that another member needs financial assistance for a specific medical issue. Members can agree to pay their share of the bill, which doesn’t exceed $140 per month for a single person under 55, or $420 for a family of four. Or they can decline—at the cost of eroding their rating on CrowdHealth’s site, making it less likely that fellow members will contribute to their own needs.\n\nRead More: Why Some Food Additives Banned in Europe Are Still on U.S. Shelves. When a member has a health care expense, they’re instructed to pay in cash, or tell a hospital that they are a self-pay customer, save the receipts, and submit them to CrowdHealth for compensation. (CrowdHealth sometimes negotiates the price of planned labs or procedures ahead of time.) The company says it covers 99.8% of claims, though it does not specify what exactly is counted in that statistic. What draws people to CrowdHealth is deep discontent with the U.S. health insurance system. The share of Americans who said that the quality of health care in the U.S. is excellent or good—44%—is the lowest since at least 2001, according to a December Gallup poll. Even many of those with good insurance coverage are frustrated at the system’s perverse incentives, byzantine regulations, and opaque processes. It’s this frustration, in part, that led to a groundswell of public support for Luigi Mangione, who was charged with first-degree murder in December for allegedly gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan. (Mangione has pleaded not guilty.)\n\n“There’s certainly a growing voice of people saying, ‘What do we need health insurance for if it’s just denying care?’” says Michelle Long, senior policy manager at KFF, a health care research group. Read More: For Many of America's Aging Workers, 'Retirement Is a Distant Dream' For better or worse, CrowdHealth is not health insurance, and there are caveats to the coverage it will provide. CrowdHealth won’t pay for procedures related to preexisting conditions, including pregnancy, until you have been a member for nine months. They won’t accept smokers, heavier individuals, or anyone age 65 and over. It doesn’t cover long-term prescription or fertility treatment. And the company expects members to spend time on the phone with medical providers negotiating a cash price, as well as sometimes putting money up front to pay the bill before waiting for reimbursement. There is no guarantee that CrowdHealth will pay for your medical procedures.\n\nStill, for some people, the idea of health-care sharing is more appealing than dealing with insurance companies. “What resonates with people is that they’re just tired of health insurance. They’re tired of these bills and these claims getting denied,” says Andy Schoonover, the CEO and founder of CrowdHealth. Schoonover says his own frustrations with health insurance motivated him to create CrowdHealth. After he sold a company and lost his employer-sponsored health insurance, he went on the health care marketplace and purchased insurance for himself, his wife, and two children, paying about $1,200 per month. Like many Americans, Schoonover had a plan through the Affordable Care Act, which dramatically expanded access to health care in America. But many consumers have reported problems getting claims approved through these plans. Nationwide, about 20% of claims through healthcare.gov insurers were denied in 2023, according to a KFF analysis.\n\nSchoonover says that his insurer refused to pay $8,000 for ear tubes to treat his one-year-old’s recurring ear infections—a treatment doctors said was medically necessary, but the insurer said was not. So Schoonover started thinking about alternatives. “I said to them, ‘Look, if you’re not willing to pay my bills, I won’t pay your bill,’” he recalls. He dropped his insurance, started to pay cash for procedures, and began looking at better ways to cover health care bills without insurance. Schoonover says he was surprised how much money he could save by offering to pay cash rather than offering up his insurance card, since he spared doctor’s offices administrative costs. But that still left the question of how to cover the crushing fees of a major health problem like cancer. That’s where the idea of CrowdHealth came in. “My next thought was, ‘If I could get a group of people willing to go the same route as me, then there could be others out there to help me in the case of a large medical event,” he says.\n\nRead More: How Doctors Are Pushing Medical Credit Cards on Patients Schoonover took to dozens of podcasts—many of which focused on Bitcoin or cryptocurrency—to promote CrowdHealth, in search of an audience already thinking of alternatives to current systems. One of them was Kyle Ward, now 33, who had gone without health insurance for 10 years after realizing that he wasn’t using his employer-sponsored health insurance yet was paying hundreds of dollars a month for coverage. Ward had weighed the pros and cons of going without health care, and when the Affordable Care Act came out, he and his wife thought about signing up for a plan. But on his $44,000 per year salary, a premium of $300 per month plus a $7,000 deductible didn’t seem worth the money, he says. He and his wife decided it was a better financial decision to invest the money they would otherwise spend on health insurance and just pay cash for health expenses.\n\nDoing so led to significant discounts, according to Ward, who says a doctor’s visit near where he lives in rural Texas was $80 if he paid cash, while his wife’s asthma medication was about $280 every three months. A gallbladder surgery that he had been told would cost $34,000 through insurance went down to $8,000 when he offered to pay cash, Ward says. Childbirth was $6,000 through a midwife who took cash. But Ward was still worried about catastrophic health events. So when he heard about CrowdHealth, he decided to sign up. It wasn’t a perfect solution. Ward has a preexisting condition that requires frequent colonoscopies, and he knew that CrowdHealth would not cover those. But CrowdHealth helped him find a place willing to do the procedure for $950 cash, he says, and he figured that CrowdHealth was still worth it. “Traditional health insurance is not working,” he says. “Maybe I’ve bought into the sales pitch, but CrowdHealth makes sense to me financially and morally—and it really feels like they want to do good.”\n\nRead More: Why You Can't Find a Pediatrician. CrowdHealth appears to be popular with users—on the website Trustpilot, it received 4.8 stars out of 5, with 411 reviews. But it won’t be the right solution for many families. It is not regulated like health insurance, and so if your claim is denied, there’s no regulator to turn to. Caroline Niziol was a member of Medi-Share, one of the largest religious health-sharing ministries, from 2015 to 2017. It saved Niziol’s family a lot of money: Medi-share cost them around $350 per month, while their traditional health insurance premium was around $850. But the ministry did not cover vaccines, physical therapy, or mental health care, and had an annual household ceiling for medical costs. When her husband had a procedure related to a chronic health condition that cost $10,000, Medi-Share refused to cover it, Niziol says, even though she believes they should have. Niziol says she had to argue with Medi-Share for months to get it covered, as she did when her newborn baby ended up in the emergency room.\n\n“I kind of feel like you get what you pay for,” she says. \"It can really be a time suck.” Medi-Share, which has 336,000 individual members, said in a statement to TIME that 80% of all bills are processed in 30 days or less. Member-voted guidelines govern what is and is not eligible for sharing, the company says, and these guidelines stipulate that there is no annual or lifetime limit on eligible medical bills. Medi-Share also says that physical therapy is eligible for sharing for up to 20 visits combined, and short-term counseling services are available by phone through Medi-Share's telebehavioral health service. CrowdHealth is small relative to religious health care sharing ministries; the Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries counts nearly 700,000 members. The unregulated nature of these health-sharing companies has drawn attention from some states. In 2022, Colorado passed a law that requires health-sharing ministries and medical cost-sharing communities to report specific information to the commissioner of insurance regarding financial operations, membership, and medical bills submitted, paid, and denied in the state. It also required these communities to provide certain disclosures to members and respond to requests for payment of medical expenses without a specific period of time.\n\nSusan Lontine, the former Democratic legislator who sponsored the bill, says she introduced it because some Colorado residents had thought their health care expenses would be covered by these ministries and were surprised to find out they were not. “We were just trying to get a handle on who these entities were,” Lontine says. The Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries sued the Colorado Division of Insurance over the law in May 2024, arguing that it deprives their members the right to exercise their religious liberty in the health care system. In the lawsuit, the alliance says that 33 states have enacted safe harbor laws clarifying that health care sharing ministries are exempt from the state insurance code. Four additional states have allowed them to operate exempt from the insurance code by providing members exemptions from state health insurance mandates. Read More: Why Your Pharmacy Experience is Miserable.\n\nHealth care experts say that people should thoroughly research their options before signing up for health sharing. Many people might qualify for free or low-cost plans through the Affordable Care Act; research by KFF suggests that about 5 million people who didn’t have insurance in 2023 could have gotten a plan through the ACA that was essentially free due to available subsidies. Experts also caution that people should think twice about giving up on health insurance because they’re healthy and they think they will continue to stay that way. “You just can’t anticipate everything that will happen,” says Long of KFF. For some people, though, having an alternative to traditional health insurance is revolutionary enough. Geoff Perlman, the CrowdHealth member whose son broke his arm, says the cost savings alone are worth it to him. As a CEO of a tech company, Perlman knows a lot about the cost of health care. He offered UnitedHealthcare to his employees, and was on the plan for a while, paying about $2,000 per month in premiums for his family of four. He then switched to Liberty, a health-sharing ministry, in 2017, paying about $1,000 a month. When his wife got breast cancer in 2020, he says, Liberty paid every bill, even negotiating $1.2 million in total costs down to $217,000, which it paid.\n\nThen Liberty raised its prices, Perlman says, and he stumbled across CrowdHealth. His family of four now pays a membership fee of about $226 a month, plus anywhere from $185 to $386 per month for the medical bills of others. He says his payments have gone down by about one-third since he signed up in July 2022.\n\nPerlman is such a fan that although he offers all eight of his employees United Healthcare, he also offers an alternative: they can receive a stipend and make arrangements for themselves, either going onto healthcare.gov and picking a plan there, or joining a health care ministry. Every single employee, he reports, has decided to take the stipend rather than sticking with employer-sponsored health insurance.\n\nCorrection, March 20: The original version of this story misstated how long people have to be members of CrowdHealth in order to have procedures related to pregnancy covered. It is nine months, not two years.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Dunn, a former practicing attorney, professor, and nonprofit executive, is a consultant focusing on systemic equity, diversity, and inclusion. She is the author of Qualified: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work\n\nThe term “imposter syndrome” has become a cultural shorthand for self-doubt. We’re told it’s something to fix within ourselves: a nagging belief that we’re unqualified or unworthy, even when all evidence points to the contrary. Yet for many women—and especially women of color—this framing misses the mark entirely.\n\nIn reality, what’s labeled as imposter syndrome in the workplace is often a misdiagnosis—a symptom of systemic inequities. It’s a response to environments steeped in bias, exclusion, and relentless scrutiny of the competence of women, Black professionals, and other people of color, a practice known as “competency checking.” Competency checking—whether intentional or unconscious—undermines those who challenge traditional norms of leadership and success. Imposter syndrome, however, masquerades as an internal failing, leading women to pathologize themselves rather than confront the systems perpetuating their struggles.\n\nThis misidentification was never clearer to me than during a conversation with a prospective client—a white woman—about a keynote speech on imposter syndrome. I explained my view: imposter syndrome is a catch-all term that obscures the real culprits—sexism, racism, and white supremacy. It can set up women to blame themselves for what is actually persistent, systemic competency checking.\n\nThe woman was visibly taken aback. She said that none of the consultants she had spoken with framed the issue this way, and one consultant had even claimed that “Everyone has imposter syndrome, and anyone who says they don’t is a liar or a narcissist.” This reductive and harmful framing shocked me. Imposter syndrome isn’t recognized as a psychiatric disorder; it’s not listed in the DSM-5 or the International Classification of Diseases. Yet the notion that everyone suffers from it has become pervasive.\n\nRead More: Yes, Impostor Syndrome Is Real. Here’s How to Deal With It\n\nI explained to her that feelings of self-doubt and uncertainty are part of being human. But these feelings differ from the systemic barriers and biases that create environments where women—and especially women of color—are made to feel unworthy. Black women, for instance, often reject the idea that they are imposters. Instead, they focus on the challenges of working within systems not designed for their success. This difference in perception can create friction with white women, who may frame these struggles through a lens of personal failings, a narrative that imposter syndrome encourages.\n\nCiting global inclusion strategist Ruchika Malhotra and writer Jodi-Ann Burey’s Harvard Business Review article “Stop Telling Women They Have Imposter Syndrome,” I emphasized that self-doubt often reflects a rational response to systemic bias. As Malhotra and Burey put it, “Impostor syndrome directs our view toward fixing women at work instead of fixing the places where women work.”\n\nUnmasking the villain\n\nI often use a metaphor inspired by Scooby-Doo to explain this dynamic. In every episode, Scooby and the gang unmask a ghostly villain, revealing it to be someone using fear to hide their schemes. Imposter syndrome is a similar mask, obscuring systemic inequities that fuel self-doubt. Once the mask is removed, the real question is: How did we get here, and why do so many—particularly white women—believe the ghost is real?\n\nThe origins of the term “impostor phenomenon,” coined in 1978, offer clues. Psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes described the experiences of 178 predominantly white, upper-middle-class women who felt intellectually fraudulent despite their achievements. The study framed their feelings as internal failings rather than responses to external pressures, such as patriarchy and white supremacy, which drive perfectionism. It overlooked the realities of sexism, classism, and racism—and the complex interplay of these forces.\n\nIf the study had included women of color, working-class white women, or others excluded from its narrow lens, it might have painted a different picture. Take Crystal Lee Sutton, the real-life inspiration for the movie Norma Rae. In 1978, when Sutton stopped her work and famously stood up on a table in the mill to protest the impact of unchecked capitalism, sexism, and racism on the poor and working-class women who worked there, she didn’t hold up a sign saying she felt like an imposter; she held up a sign that said “UNION.”\n\nThere must have been days when Sutton felt uncertain or even like a fraud—not because of a clinical disorder but because she was human. Yet she identified the real culprit: The systemic exploitation of working poor women. Sutton understood that change required building a coalition of white and Black women to challenge the status quo. She correctly identified the external factors—and fought back with the right medicine: solidarity.\n\nReimagining the solution\n\nTo move beyond imposter syndrome, we must reframe it as a systemic issue rather than an individual failing. Workplaces must become environments where microaggressions, implicit bias, and inequitable opportunities are actively dismantled. Women must recognize that self-doubt often reflects competency checking, not their actual abilities.\n\nSolidarity is crucial. Women of all backgrounds must come together to challenge the status quo, building coalitions that center the experiences of the most marginalized. Organizations, too, must reassess how they evaluate candidates for hiring and promotion: Are hidden biases baked into the criteria used to measure competence? And how do these biases disproportionately affect women and people of color?\n\nMoving toward collective action\n\nImposter syndrome thrives in isolation, convincing women that they alone are flawed. But the solution lies in collective action. By addressing the systemic roots of competency checking, we can create workplaces where self-doubt doesn’t hinder potential, and no one is punished for their confidence or ambition.\n\nWhite women must recognize that their successes and burdens are intertwined with those of women of color. The fight against competency checking isn’t just about individual self-improvement; it’s a call to dismantle the systems of oppression that undermine all women in the workplace.\n\nIn the wake of the great DEI surge of 2020–2021 and the current collapse and retreat from creating more equitable workplaces, women of color—and particularly Black women—find themselves under attack, and in desperate need of support from true allies. To move forward, we must unmask the real villains and build a future grounded in solidarity, equity, and shared power.\n\nFrom the book QUALIFIED: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work by Shari Dunn.

        "content": "On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities,” that attempts to dismantle the Department of Education. It directs newly-instated Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “return authority over education to the States and local communities.” Trump said that the department will still keep some “core necessities,\" and that Congress will vote on whether or not to abolish, since only Congress can officially dismantle a government agency.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“The Democrats know it’s right. I hope they’re going to be voting for it,” Trump said at Thursday’s press briefing about signing the Executive Order. “Because ultimately, it may come before them.” The historic gutting of the department is part of the charge that has defined the first few weeks of Trump’s second term. Led by his Department of Government Efficiency [DOGE], under the watchful eye of Elon Musk, the President has made great strides to make the government smaller by implementing major cuts and funding freezes across the board. On March 11, news came that 50% of the Department of Education was set to be laid off—part of its “final mission,” according to the department’s website, which stated that “impacted department staff will be placed on administrative leave beginning Friday, March 21st.” Speaking to TIME in early March, Jonathan E. Collins, an assistant professor of political science and education at Columbia University's Teachers College, said: “We’re more likely to continue to see what we've been seeing from the Trump Administration. Gutting all the activity underneath it and basically make it [the Department of Education] a shell of itself.”\n\nAmid concern and confusion as to what the future holds under the Trump Administration, here’s a look at the history of the Department of Education and what it actually does: When was the Department of Education established? The origins of the Department of Education can be traced back to 1867, when the first Department of this name was established by Congress. Its charge back then was very different and mostly focused on ​​collecting statistics about schools and disseminating some best educational practices. Due to concern that the department would have too much purview over schools, it was then demoted to an Office of Education under different agencies. The Department of Education as we know it today was established by Congress in the 1979 “Department of Education Organization Act,” after calls for expanded federal funding in education and “national efforts to help racial minorities, women, people with disabilities, and non-English speaking students gain equal access to education,” according to the department’s website.\n\nCollins has pointed out how the department is in its “infancy” in comparison to other agencies. “We won’t even have begun to fully see how the Department of Education can grow and transform into the best version of itself it can be… the abolition discussion has clouded that fact,” Collins said during a follow-up phone call on March 20, ahead of Trump signing the Executive Order. “We’ve had education inequality for a long time. We’ve had it longer than we’ve had the Department of Education. The persistence of it just underscores the need for some federal agency that is committed to this,\" he said. How big is the Department of Education? The Department of Education employed around 4,200 employees last September, according to the Office of Personnel Management, which accounted for about 0.2% of overall federal employment last year—the smallest staff of the 15 Cabinet agencies. Read More: What Will Happen to Student Loans If the Department of Education Is Closed Down?\n\nWhat does the Department of Education do? The Department of Education has many different and varied responsibilities under its current formation and governs many offices including the Federal Student Aid (FSA), Institute of Education Sciences (IES), Office for Civil Rights (OCR), and the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS). Under the FSA, the Education Department manages the $1.693 trillion outstanding federal student loan balance, as well several student aid programs like the Pell Grant and work study. The department is the largest source of loans for college students. The department also provides 13.6% of funding for public K-12 education, according to the Education Data Initiative, sending funding streams that include Title I—which describes federal allocation of supplemental financial assistance to school districts/schools with a high percentage of children from low-income families—as well as grants under IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), providing money to districts to serve and teach students with disabilities, and grants for things like adult rehabilitation services.\n\nThe department collects data on education facilities nationwide, and enforces non-discrimination and civil rights laws in federally funded schools, including Title VI and Title IX.\n\nCollins pointed out that Title I, Title IX, and programs at the federal level create an equalizing factor that helps to cut through education inequalities between states, creating “incentives for continuity.”\n\n“This is the problem of pursuing so much responsibility and discretion at the state level,” he said. “The potential danger [with dismantling the Department] is that you're putting a lot of responsibility on the backs of these education agencies across states that are already strapped when it comes to their capacity, and you're creating an environment where [a person’s] educational experience will become heavily dependent on the state they live in”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "January’s unveiling of DeepSeek R1, China's most advanced AI model to date, signals a dangerous inflection point in the global AI race. As President Donald Trump warned in his recent address on technological security, this development represents nothing short of a \"wake-up call\" for American leadership. What's at stake isn't merely economic competitiveness but perhaps the most geopolitically precarious technology since the atomic bomb In the nuclear age that followed Oppenheimer's creation of the atomic bomb, America's technological monopoly lasted roughly four years before Soviet scientists achieved parity. This balance of terror, combined with the unprecedented destructive potential of these new weapons, gave rise to mutual assured destruction (MAD)—a deterrence framework that, despite its flaws, prevented catastrophic conflict for decades. The stakes of nuclear retaliation discourage each side from striking first, ultimately allowing for a tense but stable standoff\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nToday's AI competition has the potential to be even more complex than the nuclear era that preceded it, in part because AI is a broadly applicable technology that touches nearly every domain, from medicine to finance to defense. Powerful AI may even automate AI research itself, giving the first nation to possess it an expanding lead in both defensive and offensive power. A nation on the cusp of wielding superintelligent AI, an AI vastly smarter than humans in virtually every domain, would amount to a national security emergency for its rivals, who might turn to threatening sabotage rather than cede power. If we are heading towards a world with superintelligence, we must be clear-eyed about the potential for geopolitical instability. We map out some of the geopolitical implications of powerful AI and propose a cohesive “Superintelligence Strategy” in a new paper released this week. Let us imagine how the U.S. might reasonably respond to rival states seeking an insurmountable AI advantage. Suppose Beijing established a lead over American AI labs and reached the cusp of recursively-improving superintelligence before us. Regardless of whether Beijing could maintain control over what it was building, U.S. national security would be deeply and existentially threatened. Rationally, the U.S. might resort to threatening sabotage in the form of cyberattacks against AI datacenters to prevent China from achieving its goal. We might similarly expect Xi Jinping—or Vladimir Putin, who has little chance of obtaining the technology first—to respond in a similar fashion if we approach recursively-improving superintelligence. They would not stand idly by if a U.S. monopoly on power was imminent.\n\nJust as the destabilizing pursuit of nuclear monopoly eventually gave way to the stability of MAD during the nuclear era, we may soon enter a parallel deterrence dynamic for AI. If any state that attempts to seize AI supremacy can expect the threat of preemptive sabotage, states may be deterred from pursuing unilateral power altogether. We call this outcome Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM). As nations wake up to this possibility, we expect it will become the default regime, and we need to prepare now for this new strategic reality. MAIM is a deterrence framework designed to maintain strategic advantage, prevent escalation, and restrict the ambitions of rivals and malicious actors. For this to work, the U.S. must make clear that any rival destabilizing AI project, especially those aiming for superintelligence, will provoke retaliation. Here, offense—or at least the credible threat of offense—is likely the best defense. That means expanding our cyberattack capabilities and enhancing surveillance of adversary AI programs.\n\nWhile building this deterrence framework, America must simultaneously advance on two additional fronts: AI nonproliferation and domestic competitiveness.\n\nFor nonproliferation, we should enact stronger AI chip export controls and monitoring to stop compute power getting into the hands of dangerous people. We should treat AI chips more like uranium, keeping tight records of product movements, building in limitations on what high-end AI chips are authorized to do, and granting federal agencies the authority to track and shut down illicit distribution routes.\n\nFinally, to maintain a competitive edge, the U.S. should focus on building resilience in its supply chains for military tech and computing power. In particular, our reliance on Taiwan for AI chips is a glaring vulnerability and a critical chokepoint. While the West has a decisive AI chip advantage, Chinese competition could disrupt that. The U.S. should therefore step up its domestic design and manufacturing capabilities. Superintelligent AI poses a challenge as elusive as any that policymakers have faced. It is what theorists Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber called a “wicked problem,” one that continually evolves with no final formula for resolution. MAIM, supplemented by robust nonproliferation and renewed investment in American industry, offers a strategy grounded in the lessons of past arms races. There is no purely technical fix that can tame these forces, but the right alignment of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness measures can help the United States navigate the emerging geopolitical reality of superintelligence.",

        "title": "8 Healthy Replacements for Eggs",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Eggs are a staple for cooking and baking. But if you’re scrambling for a replacement, your kitchen is full of dupes, from ground flaxseed to canned pumpkin. Many offer health benefits that make them comparable or even superior to actual eggs. Depending on what you’re making, eggs can contribute structure, moisture, flavor, and color, or act as a binding agent (holding ingredients together) or leavening agent (helping baked goods rise and become light and airy). So when you’re considering egg substitutes, it’s important to think through what purpose any replacement will serve in your recipe: “Do you need it as a binder, or as more of a fluffy agent? Is it in a baked dish?” asks Rebecca Russell, a functional medicine registered dietitian in Denver. Seeds tend to be great binders, for example—they’re perfect in meatballs and burgers—while applesauce and silken tofu are just right for baking.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe asked registered dietitians for their favorite swaps. Ground flaxseed Meet “flegg,” also known as ground flaxseed that’s gelatinous enough to sub for eggs in baked goods. To make it, mix 1 tablespoon of flaxseeds with 3 tablespoons of warm water, and let the concoction sit for about 5 minutes until it thickens. It works as a one-to-one substitute for eggs, Russell says. While you can technically use whole flaxseeds, grinding them up makes them easier to digest and improves their texture, she adds. Read More: What’s So Great About Cottage Cheese? Expect a mild, nutty flavor with lots of health benefits. “Flaxseeds are a great source of soluble fiber, which is important for gut health, blood sugar balance, and even weight loss,” Russell says. She likes using flegg in pancakes, banana bread, and other breakfast pastries. Because it’s a great binding agent, it also works well in dense dishes like meatloaf. Unlike many of her clients, “I can tolerate eggs just fine,” she says. “But I often still use flegg for the added benefit of the fiber.”\n\nChia seeds When you combine 1 tablespoon of chia seeds and 3 tablespoons of water, you get a “chia egg,” which replaces one traditional egg in all kinds of recipes. The mixture, which is thick and more gelatinous than flegg, has a neutral taste but can be texturally grainy. Russell recommends using it as a binding agent in poppy seed muffins, or baked goods that have walnuts or pumpkin seeds, all of which can help conceal its texture. Chia egg also works well in veggie burgers. Russell often recommends it to her clients because it’s a great source of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids. “Chia seeds are great for brain health, heart health, and inflammation,” she says. Applesauce A quarter cup of applesauce is an easy swap for one egg in recipes that require moisture. It works especially well in structured baked goods like muffins, breads, brownies, and cakes, says Kaytee Hadley, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Richmond, Va. (You wouldn’t want to use it in a fluffy meringue.) Because applesauce is naturally sweet, consider slightly tweaking your recipe. “You’re going to be getting a decent amount of sweetness, so you might want to cut back on whatever added sugar you’re using,” she suggests. “It’s a nice natural alternative—plus, you’re getting the fiber that’s in there, which is great for heart health and gut health.”\n\nRead More: 6 Things to Eat to Reduce Your Cancer Risk “Bean water” The liquid that comes in a can of chickpeas is often discarded—but can actually be repurposed as an excellent egg replacement. Officially, it’s called aquafaba, but Russell thinks of it as “bean water.” When it’s whipped, it takes on a light, fluffy texture similar to egg whites, she says, and works well in recipes that call for aeration, such as chocolate mousse, meringues, and homemade mayonnaise. Simply substitute 3 tablespoons per egg. “It’s virtually tasteless,” Russell says, which means it works well in both sweet and savory dishes. Next time you use a can of chickpeas, pour the aquafaba into an ice cube tray or small container and freeze it for up to four months; that way, you’ll have some on hand when you need it. You can either thaw it in the fridge the night before, or microwave it for a minute or two. Silken tofu Silken tofu—unlike its firm cousin—has a creamy, yogurt-like consistency that makes it ideal for baking as well as dishes such as quiche and frittatas. A quarter cup replaces one egg, and Russell recommends blending it first to make sure it’s as smooth as possible. She often encourages clients with dairy intolerance to experiment with silken tofu, since it’s so versatile. “It can soak up any sauces, seasonings, herbs, or whatever you put on it, because it has a super mild flavor,” she says. Plus, it packs a nutritional punch: Tofu is a complete protein, which means it provides all nine essential amino acids, and it’s rich in nutrients like calcium, iron, and magnesium.\n\nGreek yogurt What can’t you do with Greek yogurt? Add “egg replacement” to its long list of uses: a quarter cup is a convenient substitute for one egg. It adds moisture, creaminess, and a slight tang to baked goods, keeping them soft and tender, says Russell, who also uses it in pancakes. The only caveat, she adds, is that not everyone is wild about its taste. “You can try it out, and if you don’t like it, maybe go to something like a flaxseed or chia seed egg,” she says. Read More: Why You Should Eat a Dense Bean Salad Today Pumpkin puree If you’re the type who longs for pumpkin spice lattes year-round, you might enjoy this swap, which calls for replacing one egg with a quarter cup of pumpkin puree. “You get a little bit of pumpkin color, and a little bit of that flavor,” says Maggie Michalczyk, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Chicago. (She also happens to be the author of the cookbook Once Upon a Pumpkin, which is all about creative uses for the festive squash.) Pumpkin puree works particularly well in baked goods like breads, muffins, and cookies, she says. In addition to its pleasing taste, she gives it bonus points for adding vitamins A, C, and E to your recipe, as well as potassium and fiber.\n\nVegan egg replacements\n\nYou can now find commercial egg alternatives at almost any grocery store. JUST Egg, for example, makes plant-based substitutes that are similar to traditional eggs in taste, texture, and function but made from ingredients like mung bean protein and canola oil. Hadley, who is not affiliated with the company, eats its products every morning. “You can scramble it, or you can bake it into a nice egg dish,” she says. “The texture is shockingly similar, and it’s super convenient and mess-free.” Since it tastes somewhat mild, she recommends adding black salt to ratchet up its egg-like flavor. (The condiment’s sulfur content gives it an authentic eggy taste.)\n\nHadley also enjoys Crackd, a plant-based product made out of pea protein, which doesn’t have any saturated fat or cholesterol. “You can cook it in a skillet or microwave, and use it in baking as an egg replacement,” she says.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The environmental organization Greenpeace was ordered to pay more than $660 million dollars to the Texas-based pipeline company Energy Transfer this week over its role in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests nearly a decade ago. The outcome was a blow to the environmental advocacy group, which has previously said that a lawsuit of this size could bankrupt its U.S. operations. Energy Transfer, the operator of the Dakota Access Pipeline, accused Greenpeace USA and International of playing a central role in organizing the resistance to the pipeline at Standing Rock in 2016 and 2017. The protests drew national attention as activists set up camp on land owned by Energy Transfer in an attempt to delay the project’s construction. Law enforcement responded by deploying water cannons, tear gas, and other weapons on unarmed protesters—injuring hundreds. Greenpeace denied the company’s claims, and has said the case is “one of the largest Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPP) cases ever filed.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Greenpeace played an extremely limited role at Standing Rock, and is proud of showing up in solidarity with Standing Rock activists,” Deepa Padmanabha, senior legal advisor for Greenpeace, said in a statement in February. The protests brought together thousands of activists from around the country who opposed the development of part of the Dakota Access Pipeline on the Standing Rock reservation. “At no time did Greenpeace engage in property destruction or violence. All claims to the contrary are a reckless disregard for the truth.” Experts say that the success of the so-called SLAPP lawsuit—and heavy penalty Greenpeace was dealt—stands to silence other activists who speak up against big companies. “This verdict, especially given its scope, really changes the calculus for advocacy groups who are engaged in, not just environmental issues, but more generally, in advocacy,” says Jennifer Safstrom, director of the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School. “They too could face liability for their advocacy efforts.”\n\nWhat are SLAPP Lawsuits? SLAPP lawsuits are a type of strategic civil litigation aimed at silencing speech by burying an organization or private citizen in legal fees. The term was coined by two professors in the ‘90s, Safstrom says, who notes that the practice was created in large part to target environmental activists—so much so that the professors used another term, “eco-SLAPP,” to define the practice. \"It's an abuse of the court system, not for a legitimate legal end, but to try to shut somebody up,” says Gabe Walters, an attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. The practice has grown in prominence in the last decade. EarthRights, a non-profit environmental law group, identified 152 cases by fossil fuel companies between 2012 and 2022 that used strategic lawsuits against critics. A report by the Coalition Against SLAPPs in Europe (CASE) documented 820 SLAPP suits in Europe as of August 2023, with 161 lawsuits filed in 2022, and 135 cases filed in 2021. (The European Union passed an anti-SLAPP directive in April 2024, which aims to provide safeguards against strategic lawsuits that target public participation.)\n\nThirty-five states and Washington D.C. have anti-SLAPP laws in place, though what protections they provide may vary. Some states require that verdicts be reached on expedited timelines, while others have implemented “fee shifting,” which allows a defendant to recover legal fees if they win their case. But in states that don’t have protections in place, the impact of a SLAPP lawsuit can be devastating for organizations and individuals alike. “The goal is not even necessarily to win in court,” says Walters. “Just having to defend a lawsuit can be financially ruinous for a private person or for a nonprofit advocacy organization because the costs of litigation are so high.” How are Environmental Groups Responding? Environmental groups have said they won’t back down from their work. In a statement released after the verdict was announced, EarthRights, said that the decision would not silence environmental advocacy. “EarthRights proudly joins Greenpeace USA in speaking up against brazen legal attacks and ensuring that the environmental movement only continues to grow stronger, despite the appalling result in North Dakota.”\n\nRebecca Brown, president and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law, said that “no abusive company, lawsuit, or court decision” would hinder the climate fight. “This misuse of the legal system stifles legitimate dissent and must be seen as a direct threat to environmental justice and democratic freedoms,” said Brown. “Such tactics will not deter us, they only strengthen our commitment to resistance and solidarity and defense of the constitutionally-protected right to protest.” ClientEarth CEO Laura Clarke, said in a statement to TIME that the loss “highlights the growing trend of big polluters using the legal system to intimidate and silence critics.” “The message they seek to convey is a deeply chilling one: that no organization that challenges polluting industries is safe.” Greenpeace has said it plans to challenge the ruling. The group’s international arm also filed a lawsuit in Dutch court against Energy Transfer in 2024—one of the first tests of the European Union’s newly-enacted anti-SLAPP Directive. “Energy Transfer hasn’t heard the last of us in this fight. We’re just getting started with our anti-SLAPP lawsuit against Energy Transfer’s attacks on free speech and peaceful protest,” Kristin Casper, Greenpeace International General Counsel, said in a statement.\n\nIn the meantime, Walters warns that, without national anti-SLAPP protections in place, Wednesday’s verdict will likely embolden powerful companies—and potentially silence activists and groups that are unable to afford a costly legal battle. “The judgment in the Greenpeace case has two practical effects,” he says. “One is that the sheer size of the judgment will chill speech. It will deter others from criticizing powerful interests. The other effect is that it may incentivize copycat lawsuits. A large judgment like this can be a powerful incentive to file further litigation and try to silence critics.”",

        "title": "Rand Paul Trying to Rally GOP Opposition to Trump’s Tariffs",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Senate Republicans had gathered for one of their regular private lunches last Wednesday when Rand Paul commanded their attention. As Senators sipped diet sodas and grazed on sandwiches, the Kentucky lawmaker went through a slide deck with charts and statistics in service of a bold proposal: come out against President Trump’s tariffs. The arguments in Paul's presentation, which has not been previously reported, were not a surprise to his audience. One of the most prominent libertarians on Capitol Hill, he’s a fierce proponent of free trade. But his attempt to corral colleagues against the Trump trade agenda was seen as a provocation to the President’s close allies. “The public feels like free trade has sold us out,” Paul said, according to two Senators who were present, “but Americans are richer because of it.” Claiming that free trade agreements have spurred upward social mobility, one of his slides asserted that the middle class has shrunk in recent years only because more people had moved into the upper class.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“Basically, he was saying that everyone was getting richer during Joe Biden’s presidency,” one Senator tells TIME. For some in the room, Paul’s rebellion reflected their deep unease over Trump’s protectionism, which has rattled stock markets, shaken consumer confidence, and strained America’s relationships with its allies. Economists now fear the U.S. is heading into a recession. But for many others, it was heresy. Tariffs are not only a Trumpian fixation, they were one of his core campaign pledges and a bedrock of his plan to reshore manufacturing jobs back to the United States. To that end, Paul was asking them to undermine the President, a political suicide mission given Trump's grip over the GOP base. Among Congressional Republicans, Paul has been more recalcitrant than most. He refused to endorse Trump in the 2024 election. He was the only GOP Senator to vote against the Trump-backed government funding bill last week. While tariffs are anathema to plenty of Republicans who preach the gospel of unfettered markets, Paul is one of the only members of Congress currently speaking out against them. “When the markets tumble like this, it pays to listen,” he recently wrote on social media. Behind the scenes, he’s been even more aggressive, courting members of Congress to join his renegade mission.\n\nThis makes Paul an anomaly. At a time when most elected Republicans are either America First true-believers or traditional conservatives who have bent the knee, Paul has emerged as a thorn in Trump’s side. “They have very different ideologies,” says Whit Ayres, a veteran GOP strategist. “Rand Paul is a libertarian and Donald Trump is a populist, and they have very different views about appropriate policies given those two different ideologies.” Paul isn’t the only Republican to push back on Trump. His fellow Kentuckian Mitch McConnell has voted against some of the President’s cabinet picks, such as Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. But it’s easier for McConnell than the rest; he’s retiring at the end of this term. Other GOP Senators who have dipped their toes in the opposition have eventually acquiesced under pressure. Sen. Joni Ernst and Sen. Thom Tillis each expressed reservations about Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary. But after an onslaught of social media harassment and abuse—combined with the threat of a Trump-endorsed, Elon Musk-funded primary challenger—they both voted to send Hegseth to the Pentagon.\n\nIn some ways, Paul has been less obstreperous than them. He voted to confirm nearly all of Trump’s cabinet nominees and rhetorically sought to smooth the waters last month. “A few people may have noticed that I resisted an enthusiastic endorsement of Donald Trump during the election,” Paul wrote on X. “But now, I’m amazed by the Trump cabinet (many of whom I would have picked). I love his message to the Ukrainian warmongers, and along with his DOGE initiative shows I was wrong to withhold my endorsement.” The detente didn’t last long. He has since become a vigorous antagonist of Trump’s stiff tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, which the President insists will galvanize an American industrial renaissance. Paul’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Trump and Paul have a history of acrimony. When they each sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, Trump opened one of the first debates by ridiculing his rival. “Rand Paul shouldn’t even be on this stage,” he said. “He’s got one percent in the polls and how he got up here—there’s far too many people up here anyway.” Paul dropped out five months later.\n\nThe two also have ideological disagreements. Paul is an intellectual disciple of the so-called Chicago School of Economics, most associated with Milton Friedman, which argues for laissez-faire economic policy. Trump, for his part, has ushered in a wave of national populism, with protectionist policies as a pillar of his economic agenda. He has called tariffs “the most beautiful word in the dictionary.” Tariffs may not be as beloved by all Republicans, but Trump has cobbled a right-wing coalition together by tethering his trade posture to a classic business-friendly program of cutting taxes and regulations. The mass movement he leads has also effectively captured the GOP, which operates in service to him. In the other Capitol chamber, House Republicans recently relinquished their own authority when it comes to trade, voting earlier this month to block their ability to challenge levies imposed by the President.\n\nThe Trump Administration’s trade war could hit Paul’s constituents hard. After Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States, EU nations threatened last week to slap a 50% tariff on American whiskey, putting Kentucky bourbon in the crosshairs of a global trade war. (Trump struck back hours later by threatening a 200% tariff on European alcohol.)\n\nWhile Paul has little influence on the President, he does have a connection in the White House. One of Trump’s top policy advisers, Sergio Gor, used to be a spokesman in Paul’s Senate office. Sources close to Trump expect Gor to serve as an intermediary if Paul’s vote becomes crucial to securing an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. Paul, along with a handful of other Senators, have expressed doubts about adding to the national debt.\n\nPaul’s misgivings haven’t yet resulted in an impasse. But with Republicans holding a slim 53-seat Senate majority, that remains a future possibility. And if the tax bill creates a confrontation between the two, it may not be the last. By resisting parts of the Trump agenda, Paul may be setting himself on a collision course for 2028, when he’s up for reelection. “The thing about Trump,” says a senior GOP Senate aide. “He has a very long memory.”",

        "title": "Why Nicole Kidman Never Stops Working",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the days after giving birth, Nicole Kidman found herself unable to breastfeed. “I was so terrified, asking, What just happened? Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\n\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\n\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\n\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\n\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\n\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\n\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\n\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\n\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\n\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\n\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\n\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\n\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\n\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\n\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\n\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\n\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances. When she says her onscreen husbands have been egoless, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow. “I’ve worked with some of the greatest male actors in the world, and they’ve been so generous. All of them. Is that crazy?” Kidman laughs. She wasn’t intending to flip a trope on its head. She just did it.\n\n—\n\nStyled by Stella Greenspan; hair by Italo Gregorio; make-up by Gucci Westman; production by Perfect Projects.",

        "title": "The Complicated True Story Behind 'Good American Family'",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Good American Family Good American Family, out on Hulu, is inspired by the dramatic but real story of Natalia Grace, who lives with a rare form of dwarfism. In 2012, her adoptive parents said Grace was an adult who was posing as a child and had her age legally changed. The series examines why scrutiny grew over Grace’s age and identity. In Good American Family, Grey’s Anatomy’s Ellen Pompeo stars as Kristine Barnett, the woman who adopted a seven-year-old Natalia in 2010. At the time, Barnett was a rising star in the speakers’ circuit because of her son Jacob, a physics wiz with autism who made headlines for excelling at school when experts doubted his abilities. In the show, Kristine sees Natalia (Imogen Faith Reid) as her next project, and her husband, Michael (Mark Duplass), is ecstatic to finally have a daughter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2012—both in real life and in the show—the Barnetts had Natalia’s age changed from 8 to 22 and moved her into an apartment to live on her own. Kristine and Michael Barnett were both charged with neglecting a dependent; Michael was acquitted, and the charges against Kristine were dropped. The real Natalia Grace and Michael Barnett both got to tell their sides of the story in the docu-series The Curious Case of Natalia Grace, the third season of which just aired in January and landed Natalia on the cover of the Jan. 13, 2025, issue of People magazine. Here’s a look at a few of the biggest moments in Good American Family and how they match up with what Natalia and the Barnetts have said in past interviews.\n\nImogen Faith Reid in Good American Family Courtesy of Disney\n\nWhat happened to Natalia Grace in the Barnetts’ house In the first season of The Curious Case of Natalia Grace, Michael Barnett explains why his family wanted to adopt Natalia: “We wanted to help somebody who was in danger of never being loved.” But both Natalia and the Barnetts have accused each other of being abusive. The Barnetts have said that Natalia terrorized them, while Natalia has maintained that they were impatient with her, as someone who lives with chronic pain and trauma. At first, the family had a honeymoon period, vacationing at Disneyland with Natalia. But the minute she arrived in her new home, her new parents grew suspicious. In the first season of The Curious Case of Natalia Grace, Michael said Kristine gave Natalia her first bath in the new house and gasped when she saw Natalia had full pubic hair. He says Natalia admitted to having a period and hiding bloody underwear. About six months into living with the Barnetts, he says Natalia would try to urinate on her six-year-old sibling Ethan, defecate in the car and smear the waste onto the younger boy. He also claimed that she’d fling the door open when the car was in motion.\n\nThe Barnetts have said Natalia would take her brothers’ toys and throw them into the street, even threatening to kill them while they are sleeping. In the docu-series, Jacob Barnett says Natalia hoarded knives in her bedroom; Michael has said that he found Natalia at the edge of his bed holding a knife. Natalia confronts Michael about this story in the docu-series, arguing, “I can’t bend my fingers to even grip a knife.” She accuses the Barnetts of rehashing a similar scene from the 2009 horror movie Orphan. She claims that, while living with the Barnetts, she was hit with a belt and pepper-sprayed, according to People. Good American Family weaves these stories into the plot. In one of the most dramatic scenes in the series, Kristine orders Natalia to clean the kitchen, and is later surprised when her cup of coffee tastes like cleaning fluid. Natalia is accused of trying to poison Kristine, while Natalia says she was having trouble cleaning the kitchen properly because of her short stature.\n\nNatalia says in the docu-series that in real life, Kristine Barnett staged the poisoning. The moment ruptured any trust they might have had, says Jacob Barnett. “I can’t share a drink with someone, it’s rooted in this fear that Natalia is coming to poison us.” (Kristine Barnett did not participate in the docu-series or respond to the production's request for comment). Why was Natalia Grace’s age changed? One of the biggest questions to this day is why the Barnetts changed Natalia’s age. When the Barnetts adopted her in 2010, she was around seven years old, but they started to believe she was an adult because she had public hair and adult teeth. In Good American Family, Kristine makes it her mission to prove Natalia is an adult after noticing a bloody tampon on the floor of their home while she is taping a TV interview. She gets to work lining up doctors to prove Natalia is a 22-year-old adult, then gets her an apartment and makes her live on her own.\n\nIt’s true that an Indiana court did change Natalia Grace’s birth year from 2003 to 1989 in 2012, after a detective thought her birth certificate looked fake, according to Michael. Like in the show, the real Natalia was made to live on her own in an apartment. In the docu-series, Natalia opens up about how her apartments were never made fully accessible to her, as she couldn’t reach the stove, the shelves, or the mailbox, and didn’t have a phone she could use to call for help. A neighbor named Cynthia Mans took her under her wing, and invited her to live in her house with her husband Antwon, a Christian pastor, and their 10 children. Natalia moved in with them and they looked after her, formally adopting her in 2023. The docu-series shows Natalia’s birth date being changed back to 2003, following a genetics test that concluded she’s approximately 22-years-old.\n\nImogen Faith Reid and Mark Duplass in Good American Family Courtesy of Disney\n\nHow Good American Family ends The second season of the docu-series ends with Natalia confronting her adoptive father Michael Barnett. “I beat myself up for not being stronger,” he tells her. She says that he earned her forgiveness because he came on the show and apologized. Good American Family ends with a version of this one-on-one conversation between Natalia and Michael. In the show, Natalia shows up at Michael’s house right after his acquittal and asks why he didn’t do more to help her. “I was a kid,” she says. “You were supposed to be my dad.” Michael tells her that he “didn’t have the strength.” Then, Kristine and their son Jacob showed up to the house. Michael is caught off guard because he and Kristine are divorced. Indeed, in real life, they split in 2014. In the show, Kristine says there was a gas leak where she’s staying and asks Michael if they can stay with him. Michael says Jacob can, but not Kristine—making clear to Natalia that he is on her side. Jacob (Aaron Potter) turns to Natalia and apologizes for not doing more to stand up for her, and she tells him that it’s okay because he was also just a kid.\n\nThe show ends with Natalia surrounded by the siblings in her new adopted family after Michael has been acquitted. They read out loud the many positive statements about their sister on social media, suggesting that no matter what happened legally with the Barnetts, Natalia won in the court of public opinion.",

        "title": "How Rwanda and Congo Can Forge a Lasting Peace",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "An invasion by a neighbor with territorial ambitions. A wanton disregard of international law. A potential deal with Trump over critical minerals. No, this is not Ukraine—we are describing the tragic events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2021, Rwanda backed a rebellion in the Congo, the fifth time it has done so in the past 30 years. In January, the conflict sharply escalated, as Rwandan troops and their M23 rebel allies took control of Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo. The two border cities are home to 3 million people.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMuch like how Russia has justified the occupation of Donbas, Rwanda claims to be protecting an ethnic minority—in this case, the Tutsi community, which lives in both countries. And, as with Russian President Vladimir Putin, his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame, himself a Tutsi, claims his country has existential security concerns. Both reasons have been exaggerated by Rwanda. The crisis in the Congo has displaced 700,000 people since the beginning of the year and killed thousands. Humanitarian organizations are struggling to feed and give shelter to those in need now that USAID has cut much of the $800 million it provides to the Congo, which had amounted to 70% of the country’s entire aid budget. The crisis also threatens the stability of the government in the Congolese capital Kinshasa, as well as in Burundi, which has sent troops to help the Congo. If we don’t act, this crisis could engulf central Africa.\n\nIn contrast to Ukraine, the international community did little to address the crisis in the Congo until a month ago. For three years, the U.K. and the E.U. have actually increased aid to Rwanda despite its backing of the M23. The U.S. continued to remain Rwanda’s largest donor. The small, developing country home to 14 million people has figured out how to make itself useful, even indispensable to Western powers. It has sent troops to northern Mozambique, where a jihadist insurgency has threatened major French and Italian gas projects, and it has controversially offered to host asylum seekers from the U.K. and Denmark. And yet, the West has enormous leverage. While Rwanda has diversified its revenues—including by boosting its mineral exports to over $1 billion annually, most of which experts think comes from the Congo—it needs to maintain its reputation among foreign donors. In 2012, when Rwanda backed the same M23 rebels, the Obama Administration was critical in bringing a quick end to the crisis by cutting aid and sending a senior diplomat to help broker a peace deal. While the U.S. has cut aid and sanctioned senior Rwandan officials this time as well, there is much more it could do: impose visa bans, issue business and travel advisories, and pressure the World Bank to suspend development projects.\n\nThe private sector also has a role to play. Unwittingly, soccer teams PSG, Arsenal, and Bayern Munich are participating in sportswashing by promoting “Visit Rwanda” on their jerseys and in their stadiums. Celebrities have visited too over the past three years—among them Kevin Hart, Idris Elba, Ellen DeGeneres, and Danai Gurira—many taking pictures with President Kagame. More recently, two weeks after the M23 attack on Goma and Bukavu, John Legend performed in Kigali. (In response to the backlash that followed, he said: “I don’t believe that we should punish the people of Rwanda and punish the people of other countries when we disagree with their leaders.”) Pressure on Rwanda could produce a short-term solution to the crisis in the Congo. Belgium, Rwanda’s former colonial ruler, cut ties on Monday with the country over its role in the Congo. The E.U. also announced sanctions the same day against Rwanda for its incursion in eastern Congo and plundering its mineral wealth.\n\nThe hope is that this and other pressure could first lead to a ceasefire, forcing Rwandan troops and the M23 to withdraw from eastern Congo, and then a deal with the M23 rebels that does not jeopardize Congolese sovereignty. Kagame and Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi held direct talks in Qatar on Tuesday and called for an “immediate ceasefire” in eastern Congo, but it is unclear if M23 will heed the call after it backtracked from peace talks earlier this week. Yet this Congolese groundhog day—with a new Rwandan-backed rebellion appearing once every few years—requires a longer term solution. It is impossible to ignore the persistent crisis of governance in the Congo. A shambolic Congolese army of 130,000—supported by Burundians, local militias, and a regional force of South Africans, Malawians, and Tanzanians—was defeated by a joint Rwandan and M23 force of around 10,000 to 14,000. Opportunistic Congolese politicians and preachers have amplified hate speech against the Congolese Tutsi community, from which most M23 leaders come. In many ways, Kinshasa’s enemy is itself.\n\nCongolese leaders have a tendency for invective and to blame all their ills on Rwanda. But Congo’s leaders will also need to start looking inwards. The ongoing crackdown on the opposition and Tshisekedi’s bid to change the constitution to stay in power beyond term limits, has pushed some opponents into the arms of the M23 and Rwanda. The state’s neglect of the security services has also allowed corruption and confusion to fester in the army and police. In the long-term—and the holy grail of Congolese protest movements going back generations—the Congolese people must address the crippling crisis of corruption and misgovernance, in particular in the security forces.\n\nFinally, the main challenge will be to transform a conflict economy into one of peace. In the past, Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi lived together in peace. In the 1970s and 80s, for example, they formed a regional bank that invested in agriculture, as well as an electricity company. Even throughout this last bout of fighting, officials from all three countries have continued to staff a hydroelectric dam on their joint border. Today, billions of dollars in gold, tin, and tantalum are smuggled out to Congo’s neighbors every year. Here too, countries could collaborate on refining and tracing these minerals, turning minerals into an engine of growth instead of a conflict curse.",

        "title": "Is Trump On a Collision Course with Energy Companies?",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "When oil and gas executives first began using the phrase “all of the above” more than a decade ago, it was their pitch that climate advocates and sympathetic policymakers should keep natural gas alongside renewables in their vision of a new energy future. The grid needs abundant, reliable natural gas as back up when the wind isn’t blowing, they argued. This year, the tables have turned. With renewable energy in the Trump Administration’s crosshairs, energy industry big wigs have come to use “all of the above” as a reminder that renewable energy—particularly solar—has an important role to play in keeping the lights on.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“We believe in all forms of energy,” said John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra Energy, the world’s most valuable electricity company, at a CERAWeek side event. “When we go to customers, we don't really care if we're selling wind turbines or gas turbines, we want to give them the lowest cost solution.” To hear some activists talk about the new Trump Administration, the president blindly does the bidding of his fossil fuel benefactors. And, in public, many top executives are keen to praise Trump and show close relations with the White House. But behind the scenes many in the industry are more measured, and even critical. Projections of soaring power demand in the U.S. have led utility executives to turn to whatever power source is available—including wind and solar—even as the Trump Administration tries to diminish renewables. Tariffs have threatened the bottomline. And oil executives have woken up to the reality that Trump’s vision of low oil prices doesn’t align with increased domestic production—or industry profits.\n\nIt’s certainly possible that these tensions remain under wraps. Corporate executives are not inclined to cross Trump, and market forces may be strong enough to keep the energy sector humming along mostly in line with expectations. Nonetheless, understanding the complicated nuance—which in many ways is counterintuitive—is important to grappling with the opportunities to minimize emissions in the coming years. There is no better place to digest energy industry sentiments and trends than the annual CERAWeek conference by S&P Global in Houston. The conference, held last week, draws energy executives and government officials from around the world. This year’s conference, which I attended for part of last week, offered a prime example of the phrase “two things can be true at once.” Industry officials widely praised some of the new administration’s deregulatory moves, but at the same time many expressed deep concerns about the uncertainty that Trump has created.\n\n\"Swinging from one extreme to another is not the right policy approach,\" Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said on the CERAWeek main stage. \"We have allocated capital that's out there for decades, and so we really need consistent and durable policy.\" Jack Fusco, CEO of natural gas company Cheniere, praised the administration for pivoting the “regulatory machine” in a direction that’s “fair and transparent.” But he followed his praise with a hint of apprehension, saying he hoped the agenda would “hold up in a rule of law”—an acknowledgement of the litigation and uncertainty that surrounds much of Trump’s policy agenda. Even attacks on the Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s landmark climate change law, have some corners of the industry worried. Oil and gas companies had planned to pursue tax incentives for technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture and storage—and dedicated billions in capital to doing so. “We're looking for the continuation of 45Q,” said Vicki Hollub, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum, referring to a tax credit for carbon capture on the conference main stage. “To accelerate the technology at the pace that the U.S. needs it to accelerate, to start having the positive impact on our energy independence, we need 45Q to happen and to stay in place.” (The provision is thought to be one of the credits most likely to survive though everything will be in play during negotiations).\n\nBehind the scenes many executives offered more vocal concern. As stocks plummeted on the conference’s opening day, executives stewed over tariffs that Trump imposed on Canada’s energy sector, which is highly integrated with the U.S. And Trump’s unpredictable approach more broadly drew concern. In the long term, different views on the price of oil may represent the biggest potential collision. Trump has repeatedly suggested he would like to see the price of oil come down as low as $50/barrel. (Right now the U.S. benchmark for crude oil is around $72/barrel). Voters love low energy prices because it means affordable gas at the pump. But oil companies hate when prices sink too low because it’s harder to turn a profit. For utility executives, the complication of rising power demand remains top of mind. Analysts have predicted soaring demand for electricity as technology companies grow their data center footprint in response to artificial intelligence. That has led the industry to pursue whatever electricity it can build quickly—a lot of natural gas, yes, but also a lot of solar.\n\nAs I’ve written before, the dynamic nature of the Trump Administration’s policymaking makes it difficult for companies to plan. And predicting what comes next is folly. But whatever happens it’s safe to say that the convenient narrative of a Trump Administration moving in lockstep with the energy sector is, at the very least, missing several puzzle pieces.\n\nIt also means, oddly, that the most influential advocates in Washington for some decarbonization provisions—like carbon capture, sustainable aviation fuel, and hydrogen—may be energy executives embracing the “all of the above” mantra. But even that may not be enough to save climate-friendly tax incentives.\n\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here\n\nTIME receives support for climate coverage from the Outrider Foundation.TIME is solely responsible for all content.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\n\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\n\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\n\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\n\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\n\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\n\n****\n\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\n\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\n\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\n\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\n\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\n\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\n\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\n\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital",

        "content": "From December 2024 to February 2025, the effects of human-induced climate change were evident in nearly all regions of the world, new analysis from Climate Central has found. The report, which examined how climate change influenced temperatures around the world over the past three months, found that about one in five people globally—or 1.8 billion people—experienced temperatures that were strongly influenced by climate change every single day. And in half of the analyzed countries, and 287 cities around the world, the average person experienced temperatures strongly influenced by climate change for at least one-third of the three-months. The findings come as the planet breached 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial temperatures last year—a critical threshold that nations were striving to avoid under the Paris Agreement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“We found that there were warmer than normal temperatures caused by climate change almost everywhere around the planet,” says Kristina Dahl, vice president for science at Climate Central. This January ranked as the warmest in the 176-year global climate record, according to data from the U.S. National Oceanic and and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Temperatures in Europe, Canada, South America, Africa, and much of Australia and Antarctica were above average, according to data from Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Within the same three-month period analyzed, about 394 million people experienced 30 or more “risky heat days.” These are defined as days where the local temperature was hotter than 90% of daily temperatures observed between 1991-2020. Read more: Why Extreme Heat Is So Bad for the Human Body Risky heat days are “associated with a temperature threshold that carries additional risks for human health,” says Dahl. “Above that temperature, you start to see increased heat related mortality.” In February, parts of Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and the United Republic of Tanzania all saw temperatures soar during a heat wave. Hospitals in Uganda reported an increase in heat-related illnesses, including dehydration and heat stroke, according to local news sources.\n\nThe research showed that a high number of risky heat days is far more common in the Global South: 74% of people who experienced 30 or more days of risky heat lived in Africa, while those living in Brazil, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea also saw 30 or more risky heat days.\n\n“[It] really reinforces something that we see consistently with climate change, [which] is that the people who have contributed the least to the problem are often disproportionately exposed and impacted,” says Dahl.\n\nIn the U.S., around 45% of cities analyzed experienced average temperatures that were normal or warmer-than-normal, while 14 cities, mostly in the west, experienced at least three weeks’ worth of days where average temperatures were twice as likely to be impacted by climate change.\n\n“These [findings] are just the latest reminders that climate change is happening here and now it's not something of the future,” says Dahl. “People are experiencing it every day in their lives around the world.”",

        "content": "ROME — Pope Francis will be released from the hospital on Sunday, after 38 days battling a life-threatening case of pneumonia in both lungs, his doctors said. Gemelli medical director Dr. Sergio Alfieri said Saturday that Francis will require at least two months of rest and rehabilitation as he continues recovering back at the Vatican. Francis was admitted to Gemelli hospital on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened. He later developed a life-threatening case of pneumonia.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPope Francis ’ doctors provided their first in-person update on the pontiff’s condition in a month, in a sign that he has made good and steady progress in his battle against double pneumonia. The Saturday evening briefing is the first since Feb. 21, a week after the 88-year-old Francis was brought to Gemelli hospital. He subsequently experienced several respiratory crises that landed him in critical condition, though he has since stabilized. In another development, the Vatican announced that Francis would appear on Sunday morning to bless faithful from his 10th floor suite at the hospital. While Francis released an audio message on March 6 and the Vatican distributed a photo of him March 16, Sunday’s blessing will be the first live appearance since Francis was admitted on Feb. 14 for what has become the longest hospitalization of his 12-year papacy. The Argentine pope, who has chronic lung disease, is prone to respiratory problems in winter and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted after a bout of bronchitis worsened.\n\nDoctors first diagnosed a complex bacterial, viral and fungal respiratory tract infection and soon thereafter, pneumonia in both lungs. Blood tests showed signs of anemia, low blood platelets and the onset of kidney failure, all of which later resolved after two blood transfusions.\n\nThe most serious setbacks began on Feb. 28, when Francis experienced an acute coughing fit and inhaled vomit, requiring he use a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask to help him breathe. He suffered two more respiratory crises in the following days, which required doctors manually aspirate the mucus, at which point he began sleeping with the ventilation mask at night to help his lungs clear the accumulation of fluids.\n\nAt no point did he lose consciousness, and doctors reported he was alert and cooperative.\n\nOver the past two weeks, he has stabilized and registered slight improvements, the Vatican press office has reported. He no longer needs to wear the ventilation mask at night, and is cutting back his reliance on high flows of supplemental oxygen during the day.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has made good on his promise of revoking security clearance for former President Joe Biden. Issued late on Friday night, a memo titled “Rescinding Security Clearances and Access to Classified Information from Specified Individuals” laid out Trump’s instructions for Biden, several members of the Biden Administration, and other political rivals to have their security clearances rescinded. Trump determined it was “no longer in the national interest” for said individuals to still hold “any active security clearance” or “unescorted” access to government facilities. “This action includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President’s Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the Intelligence Community by virtue of the named individuals’ previous tenure in the Congress,” the memo reads.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe action was applied to Biden and “any other member of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s family.” Joining the former President on the list was his former Vice President, and Trump’s one-time opponent in the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris. Trump’s 2016 opponent and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was also listed, alongside former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former National Security Advisor Jacob Sullivan, and former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. Read More: Is Trump Set to Impose a New Travel Ban? Here Are the Countries That Could Be at Risk In addition, New York Attorney General Letitia James and the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg—both of whom prosecuted Trump—as well as Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger—Republicans and former Representatives who served on the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol—were added to the list of people who will have such privileges rescinded.\n\nThe memo also includes whistleblower lawyer Mark Zaid and Fiona Hill, Trump’s former Russia analyst who testified during Trump’s first impeachment hearing. Norman Eisen, an attorney leading various lawsuits against the Trump Administration, also joined attorney Andrew Weissmann and Alexander Vindman, the former Director for European Affairs for the National Security Council, on the list. In an emailed statement sent to TIME, Zaid says: “There are many of us who will not be bullied or intimidated, notwithstanding the continued attacks on lawyers.” “Lawyers are the first line of defense against authoritarianism, which is why Shakespeare's “Dick the Butcher” [character] wants to kill us in Henry VI [Part 2]” he says. “It looks like President Trump has found a more effective way of eliminating those he fears might challenge him.” Meanwhile, Vindman responded to the memo via social media, saying: “I’m not a weak-kneed billionaire or a massive spineless law firm, so I don’t care what noises Donald Trump makes about a security clearance that hasn’t been active for five years.”\n\nFormer Presidents and other previously-serving officials are often given access to classified information as a courtesy, even after they leave office. In 2021, though, Biden took away Trump’s security clearance—citing what he said was Trump’s “erratic behavior” around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Trump had earlier announced his intention to revoke Biden’s security clearance on Feb. 7, posting on his social media platform, Truth Social, about his decision. \"There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information. Therefore, we are immediately revoking Joe Biden’s Security Clearances, and stopping his daily Intelligence Briefings,” Trump said. “I will always protect our National Security — JOE, YOU'RE FIRED.” Meanwhile, on March 17, Trump announced he was revoking Secret Service protection for Biden’s adult children, and earlier this year, the Administration reportedly took away security details for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n\nBrooklyn Law School professor Heidi Gilchrist, a former CIA analyst and expert on national security, says that for some in government, losing security clearance means “losing your livelihood,” and government officials may well begin thinking about the potential political fallout of their actions with the President.\n\nShe notes that Trump does have “broad authority” as President to revoke clearances, but believes that there is a “strong argument here” that the First Amendment is being violated by revoking clearance for political opponents. In fact, she believes there may even be an “opening” for the courts to get involved.\n\n“Courts generally will not review security clearance decisions, as they just defer to the executive branch in matters of national security,” Gilchrist says. “But this [instance] is not based on any sort of national security expertise or rationale… this could be a clear opening for courts to review clearance decisions which they've stayed away from in the past.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "BROOKLINE, Mass. — Kitty Dukakis, the wife of former Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, who spoke openly about her struggles with depression and addiction, has died. She was 88. Dukakis died on Friday night surrounded by her family, her son, John Dukakis, said on Saturday by telephone. She fought to make the world better, “sharing her vulnerabilities to help others face theirs,” her family said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“She was loving, feisty and fun, and had a keen sensitivity to people from all walks of life,” the family said. “She and our dad, Michael Dukakis, shared an enviable partnership for over 60 years and loved each other deeply.” Dukakis won high marks as a political campaigner during her husband's 1988 presidential efforts, stumping tirelessly for him. She was called a key influence in his decision to seek the presidency. She even figured in the opening question of a 1988 presidential debate, when her husband was asked: \"Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\" Dukakis said he would not, and his unemotional response was widely criticized. Earlier in the campaign, in 1987, Dukakis revealed she had overcome a 26-year addiction to amphetamines five years earlier after receiving treatment. She said she began taking diet pills at age 19.\n\nHer husband made anti-drug efforts a major issue and she became prominent in the effort to educate youngsters against the perils of drug and alcohol abuse. But a few months after Michael Dukakis lost the election to Vice President George H.W. Bush, Kitty Dukakis entered a 60-day treatment program for alcoholism. Several months later she suffered a relapse and was hospitalized after drinking rubbing alcohol. In her 1990 autobiography, \"Now You Know,\" she blamed her mother for much of her alcohol and drug addiction and a long history of low self-esteem. In 2006, she wrote another book, \"Shock,\" which credits the electroconvulsive therapy she began in 2001 for relieving the depression she had suffered for years. The treatment, she wrote, \"opened a new reality for me.\" Current Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey called Dukakis “a force for good in public life and behind the scenes,” a leader in the effort to ensure that the Holocaust is never forgotten, and an advocate for children, women and refugees.\n\n\"She spoke courageously about her struggles with substance use disorder and mental health, which serves as an inspiration to us all to break down stigma and seek help,” Healey said in a statement. Dukakis used her personal pain to help others, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said in a statement on social media on Saturday. \"Her legacy will live on in the policies she helped shape and the people she inspired to speak their own truths,” Campbell said. Dukakis broke ground by speaking openly about her struggles and championed support for the homeless and political refugees, said Maria Ivanova, director of Northeastern University’s Policy School, which hosts the Kitty and Michael Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy. “Kitty Dukakis brought honesty, compassion, and strength to public life,” Ivanova said in a statement. “Her legacy is one of service, resilience, and truth-telling.”\n\nDukakis and her future husband met while attending high school in Brookline, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb. He was dull and frugal; she was dramatic and fancy. He is Greek Orthodox; she was Jewish. Dukakis, who was divorced and had a 3-year-old son, married Dukakis in 1963, and they had two children, Andrea and Kara. Dukakis, whose late father, Harry Ellis Dickson, was associate conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, earned degrees in modern dance and broadcasting. After the presidential election, in 1989, Bush appointed her to be a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council. She earlier served on the President's Commission on the Holocaust in 1979 and on the board of directors of the Refugee Policy Group. She has also been a member of the Task Force on Cambodian Children. By the late 1990s, Dukakis and her husband divided their time between Massachusetts and California, where she was a social worker and he was a professor for part of the year at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n—Former Associated Press writer Lisa Flam contributed to this report.",

        "content": "A lawsuit filed late Friday accuses the Trump Administration of unlawfully shutting down the Voice of America and asks a federal court to restore the outlet that for decades has supplied news about the United States to nations around the world — including many that lack a free press of their own. The case, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, was brought by Voice of America reporters, Reporters Without Borders and a handful of unions against the U.S. Agency for Global Media and Kari Lake, the failed Arizona candidate who is President Trump's representative there.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“In many parts of the world, a crucial source of objective news is gone, and only censored state-sponsored news media is left to fill the void,” the lawsuit said. Lake has described the broadcast agency as a “giant rot” that needs to be stripped down and rebuilt. Voice of America dates to World War II as a source of objective news, often beamed into authoritarian countries. Funded by Congress, it is protected by a charter that guarantees its product pass muster for journalistic rigor. Suit accuses the Administration of taking a ‘chainsaw’ approach The lawsuit charges that the Trump Administration has effectively shut it down unlawfully in the past week. Republicans have complained that the news source is infected by left-wing propaganda, a contention its operators say isn't backed up factually. “The second Trump Administration has taken a chainsaw to the agency as a whole in an attempt to shutter it completely,” the lawsuit said. There was no immediate response Friday to a request for comment from the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and a handful of sister networks.\n\nIn an interview with Newsmax earlier this week, Lake described Voice of America as “like having a rotten fish and trying to find a portion that you can eat.” In a post on X, she said the Agency for Global Media is “a giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer — a national security risk for the nation — and irretrievably broken. While there are bright spots within the agency with personnel who are talented and dedicated public servants, this is the exception rather than the rule.” Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders in the United States, said his organization was compelled to act to protect Voice of America and the broader press freedom community. There are other media-related actions, too At VOA's sister operation, Radio Free Asia, unpaid furloughs took effect on Friday for roughly 240 people in the operation's Washington office, or 75% of the staff members, spokesman Rohit Mahajan said. Radio Free Asia has also moved to cancel freelance contracts with people who helped the agency gather news overseas.\n\nRadio Free Asia also expects to file a lawsuit to keep congressionally-appropriated funding flowing, Mahajan said.\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty filed suit on Tuesday, asking the U.S. District Court in Washington to compel the U.S. Agency for Global Media to make its next payment. RFE/RL currently broadcasts in 23 countries across Europe and Asia, in 27 different languages.\n\nIn its lawsuit, the organizations called the denial of funding unprecedented and said it has already forced operations to be significantly scaled back. “Without its congressionally appropriated funds, RFE/RL will also be forced to stop the vast majority of its journalistic work and will be at risk of ceasing to exist as an organization,” they argued.",

        "content": "Michelle Zauner wants to set the record straight: She is not trying to reclaim the label “sad girl music.” Since announcing the title of her highly anticipated fourth studio album, For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), the author, director, and front woman of indie-pop band Japanese Breakfast has been surprised to see how divisive the title has become, and the assumptions it’s given way to. Some thought she was writing a collection of sad breakup songs; others that she was taking ownership of a label that has previously been wielded with the intent to belittle or insult.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I think [the album title] was a little bit tongue-in-cheek,” Zauner says with a chuckle over Zoom in early February. “And it was maybe taken very literally.” “Sad girl music” is a fraught subject, and Zauner chooses her words carefully. “I don’t want to get into trouble,” she says, explaining that a lot of brilliant women songwriters get unfairly punted into that category. And it’s true: the music industry and the internet have made a nasty habit of reducing songwriting by women that deals with complex emotions in this way—Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski, and Lana Del Rey have had to fend off these degrading designations for years.\n\nZauner, though, is interested to see what people will say once they’ve had a listen to the project in its entirety. With the album due March 21, Zauner, 35, finds herself in a constant state of “caring, then not caring, and then pretending to care.” Her mood matches the weather outside our windows: “I’m a winter person in the sense that I feel like I must suffer through something to enjoy the coming season,” she says and laughs heartily. The stakes feel high after her past few years. For Melancholy Brunettes arrives four years after Zauner’s rise from indie-music darling to literary heavyweight with the release of her wildly successful, gut-punching memoir Crying in H Mart, which explored her Korean American identity and her relationship with her late mother Chongmi, who died of cancer in 2014. Written in arresting, empathetic prose, it became an instant New York Times best seller and is currently in its 39th printing.\n\nRead More: Michelle Zauner Is on the 2022 TIME 100 List Zauner followed up Crying in H Mart with Japanese Breakfast’s third studio album, Jubilee. Unlike the book, the album took a sharp turn away from grief into cathartic joy, blending dreamy synth-pop chords with shoe-gaze sensibilities. It was equally met with critical success, earning the group nominations for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album at the 2022 Grammys. For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), though, is worlds away from the sonic landscape of Jubilee. It’s not quite in the sphere of Crying in H Mart, either. Here, Zauner is exploring something bleaker—crueler and more punishing. She’s trying to see what darkness, of all different kinds, looks like when you stare it right in the face. When I ask what comes to mind when Zauner thinks of melancholy brunettes, she excitedly whips out her phone to rattle off some references: Paintings like L’Absinthe by Edgar Degas, Tired by Ramón Casas, and The Wedding Dress by Frederick Elwell—all interpretations of women experiencing massive despair—were hugely informative to the record. They were especially important to the album art, which sees Zauner looking like a gothic, Brontëesque character, face down on a table surrounded by a plentiful feast. “I like the idea of being someone just collapsed on a table, surrounded by a wealth of goods. Like a spoiled prince or something,” she explains.\n\nWhen Zauner began writing For Melancholy Brunettes in the winter of 2022, she was clear that she wanted to do something from a more introspective place. She wanted to write songs that were also more guitar-focused, compared to Jubilee’s lush horns and slinky synths, and teamed up with producer Blake Mills (who, among his vast repertoire of acts, has worked with other virtuosic rock acts like Fiona Apple, Perfume Genius, and Alabama Shakes) to record the album at Sound City in Los Angeles—making it the band’s first proper studio release after working on their first three records with friends in makeshift recording studios. As she began piecing the songs together, Zauner was also reading—a lot. She wanted to explore how the concept of melancholy has evolved in stories of love and longing, society and familial relationships over time. She worked her way from European Romanticism to Greek mythology before turning to Gothic Romance classics like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Frankenstein, and even modernist staples like The Magic Mountain by German author Thomas Mann, which is her husband and fellow bandmate Peter Bradley’s favorite book and directly inspired a song on the album.\n\nShe also became increasingly fascinated with works “that could be categorized as part of the incel canon,” Zauner says—books that the mostly male subculture of self-described “involuntary celibates” has glorified for their depiction of loneliness and manhood—think American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Zauner hoped to better understand why this type of “confused masculinity” and Joker-like anger and loneliness emerges; how these aggrieved and occasionally violent men process the world. “If I look back at my very early work, it’s always been [there]—this fear of men,” she says. “There is this disappointment and fear of men, and these creepy stories—like an ominous thing has happened or is about to happen—that threads the songs together.”\n\nZauner, second from right, performs with Japanese Breakfast Todd Owyoung—NBC/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, listening to the new album feels not unlike you’re Cathy (or Heathcliff) staring at the misty English moors, as impending doom envelops you from all angles: On “Honey Water,” a woman finds herself in a marriage to a slimy, unfaithful man, and equates him to a thirsty bug. On “Mega Circuit,” a lustful spectator watches a gang of incels meander around over a feverish, sinister guitar shuffle. On “Little Girl,” perhaps one of the most devastating ballads on the record, a father, urinating in a corner of a lonely hotel room, wonders how he became estranged from his daughter. (“Seven years of running at this breakneck speed/ Convalescing cheaply far abroad/ Dreaming of a daughter who won’t speak to me/ Running for her father coming home.”) Dramatic as they may seem, these sentiments are strikingly relatable—feelings of yearning and amorphous despair on an album releasing in the middle of a public-health crisis of loneliness.\n\nThe lyrics, the storytelling, the sparse, meticulous melodies—it’s all so beautifully punishing, and that is exactly the point. After her mom died, Zauner says, she “became very work-obsessed.” While work was a grounding force, it came at a cost: “I kind of lost track of any form of self-care or personal life, or family and friends.” Following the release of Crying in H Mart and then Jubilee (and a much-needed sabbatical in Korea), Zauner found herself thinking about what it means to be a creative working woman in her mid-30s—the price one pays for their ambitions. It was playing on Zauner’s mind a lot as she was making For Melancholy Brunettes, especially when she thought about balancing her work with expanding her family. “There is this anticipatory grief about wanting to become a mother and having to reckon with the creative loss that that will usher in,” Zauner says. “I was thinking about how much I’ve excused men for poor behavior because of their positions of power and the work that they’ve had to do to provide for their family.” Now, as Zauner has grown into her creative career, she questions the elusive balancing act between the “narcissism that comes with being an artist and [the desire to be] a good human being.”\n\nIt’s what drew her to write the album’s lead single, “Orlando in Love.” Inspired by John Cheever’s nod to Orlando Innamorato, an unfinished epic poem by the Renaissance poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, the song is a story about “a foolish, romantic guy” who succumbs to a siren’s call, and in some ways, Zauner’s personal reflection on success. “You’re pursuing your dreams in a very foolhardy way, and sometimes you’re punished for just how straight you’re going with it,” she says. “Like, if you go too far in your ambitions, it likely will not end well.” The 2025 Grammys happened a week before Zauner and I spoke, and the internet was still buzzing not only from Beyoncé’s finally winning Album of the Year, but another artist who unequivocally spoke their mind that night: Chappell Roan. Roan, who received the Grammy for Best New Artist, got up to the podium and called out the record industry for not supporting emerging artists with necessities like a livable wage and health insurance. When Zauner heard this, she immediately took to X to congratulate Roan, writing, “f-ck ya Chappell!!!!!” That got her in a bit of trouble: some people interpreted “ya” to mean an insulting “you” instead of an enthusiastic “yes.” Zauner couldn’t believe it.\n\nRead More: Leave Chappell Roan Alone\n\n“Let the record show that I thought it was amazing, and I think it’s so ridiculous how much crap she has to endure for all of the good that she’s putting into the world. She inspires me to be a more outspoken, braver artist,” Zauner says. Having been nominated in the same category, she finds it a bit funny that these award shows so aggressively avoid naming the problems that plague the same industry they are celebrating. But Roan, she says, “very eloquently and very courageously said exactly what the problem is.”\n\nPerhaps that’s what For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women) is trying to do, too. Naming the problem—and hoping that despite the scars, the battle wounds, the punishment, and the castigations, we’ll all come out the other end into the light.",

        "title": "Champion Boxer George Foreman Dies at 76",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "George Foreman became the heavyweight champion of the world in his 20s, only to lose his belt to Muhammad Ali in perhaps the most memorable fight in boxing history. A full 20 years later in 1994, the 45-year-old Foreman became the oldest man to win the heavyweight championship, throwing one perfect combination to steal Michael Moorer's title in an epic upset. Few fighters ever had more big moments than Big George Foreman — and even after he finally left the ring, he was only getting started.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe fearsome heavyweight, who lost the “Rumble in the Jungle” to Ali before his inspiring second act as a surprising champion and a successful businessman, died Friday night. Foreman was 76. Foreman's family announced his death on social media, not saying how or where he died. “A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father and a proud grand- and great-grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility and purpose,\" his family wrote. “A humanitarian, an Olympian and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected. A force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name— for his family.” A native Texan, Foreman began his boxing career as an Olympic gold medalist who inspired fear and awe as he climbed to the peak of the heavyweight division by stopping Joe Frazier in 1973. His formidable aura evaporated only a year later when Ali pulled off one of the most audacious victories in boxing history in Zaire, baiting and taunting Foreman into losing his belt.\n\nForeman left the sport a few years later, but returned after a 10-year absence and a self-described religious awakening. The middle-aged fighter then pulled off one of the most spectacular knockouts in boxing history, flooring Moorer — 19 years his junior — with a surgical right hand and claiming Moorer's two heavyweight belts. Foreman's 20 years is easily the longest gap between heavyweight title reigns. Foreman's transformation into an inspirational figure was complete, and he fought only four more times — finishing 76-5 with 68 knockouts — before moving onto his next career as a genial businessman, pitchman and occasional actor. Outside the ring, he was best known as the face of the George Foreman Grill, which launched in the same year as his victory over Moorer. The simple cooking machine sold more than 100 million units and made him much wealthier than his sport ever did. “George was a great friend to not only myself, but to my entire family,” Top Rank president Bob Arum said. “We’ve lost a family member and are absolutely devastated.”\n\nIn the first chapter of his boxing career, Foreman was nothing like the smiling grandfather who hawked his grills on television to great success. Foreman dabbled in petty crime while growing up in Houston’s Fifth Ward, but changed his life through boxing. He made the U.S. Olympic team in 1968 and won gold in Mexico City as a teenager, stopping a 29-year-old opponent in a star-making performance. Foreman rose to the pinnacle of the pro game over the next five years, but was also perceived as an aloof, unfriendly athlete, both through his demeanor and through the skewed racial lenses of the time. Jim Lampley, the veteran boxing broadcaster who worked alongside Foreman for many years at HBO, told The Associated Press on Friday night that Foreman's initial demeanor was an attempt by his camp to emulate Sonny Liston, the glowering heavyweight champ of the 1960s. “At some point somewhere along the way, he realized that wasn’t him,\" Lampley said.\n\nForeman stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell’s iconic call: “Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!” Foreman defended his belt against Ken Norton before accepting the fight with Ali in the now-immortal bout staged in Africa by promoter Don King. Ali put on a tactical masterclass against Foreman, showing off the “rope-a-dope” strategy that frustrated and infuriated the champion. Foreman was eventually knocked down for the first time in his career, and the fight was stopped in the eighth round. Foreman told the BBC in 2014 that he took the fight almost out of charity to Ali, who he suspected to be broke. “I said I was going to go out there and kill him, and people said, ‘Please, don’t say you’re going to kill Muhammad,’” Foreman said. “So I said, ‘OK, I’ll just beat him down to the ground.’ That’s how easy I thought the fight would be.”\n\nExhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade preaching and working with kids in Houston after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s with a plan to defy time through frequent ring appearances, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a surprisingly competitive title fight in 1991. Three years later, Foreman got in the ring with Moorer in Las Vegas, more for his celebrity than for his perceived ability to beat Moorer. The champion appeared to win the first nine rounds rather comfortably, with Foreman unable to land his slower punches. But Foreman came alive in the 10th, hurting Moorer before slipping in the short right hand that sent Moorer to the canvas in earth-shaking fashion. Lampley, who was calling the fight, named his upcoming autobiography — which includes a prologue about Foreman — after his famous call of that moment: “It Happened!”\n\nForeman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. Much of the world soon knew Foreman as both a lovable friend and a ferocious fighter. “He started performing as this pitchman, this product pitchman with the big, ever-present giant grin on his face,\" Lampley recalled. \"When I was working with him, people would say, ‘George is a big clown.’ And I would say, ‘Well, you can call him a clown, but he’s actually a genius. He may be the greatest genius I’ve ever met.’ And people would say, ‘Well, genius, what do you mean?’ I’d say, ‘Well, check the bank account. If that isn’t proof enough, I don’t know what is.’ So, he was a genius. He was a human genius.” Foreman briefly starred in a sitcom called “George” in the 1990s, and he even appeared on the reality singing competition “The Masked Singer” in 2022. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023.\n\nForeman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman.\n\n“Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,” WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on social media. “His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.”\n\n—AP Sports Writer Brian Mahoney contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Rembrandt to Picasso: Five ways to spot a fake masterpiece\n\n12 March 2025 Share Save Kelly Grovier Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe recent discovery of an art forger's workshop reminds us of the long history of fraudulent artworks – here are the simple rules to work them out.\n\nIt's everywhere: fake news, deep fakes, identity fraud. So ensnared are we in a culture of digitised deceptions, a phenomenon increasingly augmented by artificial intelligence, it would be easy to think that deceit itself is a high-tech invention of the cyber age. Recent revelations however – from the discovery of an elaborate, if decidedly low-tech, art forger's workshop in Rome to the sensational allegation that a cherished Baroque masterpiece in London's National Gallery is a crude simulacrum of a lost original – remind us that duplicity in the world of art has a long and storied history, one written not in binary ones and zeroes, but in impossible pigments, clumsy brushstrokes and suspicious signatures. When it comes to falsification and phoniness, there is indeed no new thing under the Sun.\n\nOn 19 February, Italy's Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage uncovered a covert forgery operation in a northern district of Rome. Authorities confiscated more than 70 fraudulent artworks falsely attributed to notable artists from Pissarro to Picasso, Rembrandt to Dora Maar, along with materials used to mimic vintage canvases, artist signatures, and the stamps of galleries no longer in operation. The suspect, who has yet to be apprehended, is thought to have used online platforms such as Catawiki and eBay to hawk their phoney wares, deceiving potential buyers with convincing certificates of authenticity that they likewise contrived.\n\nNews of the clandestine lab's discovery was quickly followed by publicity for a new book, due for release this week, alleging that one of The National Gallery's highlights is not at all what it seems. According to artist and historian Euphrosyne Doxiadis, author of NG6461: The Fake National Gallery Rubens, the painting Samson and Delilah – a large oil-on-wood attributed to the 17th Century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens and purchased by the London museum in 1980 for £2.5m (then the second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction) – is three centuries younger than the date of 1609-10 that sits beside it on the gallery wall and is incalculably less accomplished than the museum believes.\n\nAlamy Samson and Delilah, by Peter Paul Rubens (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDoxiadis's conclusion corroborates one reached in 2021 by the Swiss company, Art Recognition, which determined, through the use of AI, that there was a 91% probability that Samson and Delilah is the work of someone other than Rubens. Her assertion that the brushwork we see in the painting is crass and wholly inconsistent with the fluid flow of the Flemish master's hand is strongly contested by The National Gallery, which stands by its attribution. \"Samson and Delilah has long been accepted by leading Rubens scholars as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens\", it said in a statement given to the BBC. \"Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality. A technical examination of the picture was presented in an article in The National Gallery's Technical Bulletin in 1983. The findings remain valid.\"\n\nThe divergence of opinion between the museum's experts and those who doubt the work's authenticity opens a curious space in which to reflect on intriguing questions of artistic value and merit. Is there ever legitimacy in forgery? Can fakes be masterpieces? As more sophisticated tools of analysis are applied to paintings and drawings whose legitimacy has long been in question (including several works attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, such as the hotly disputed chalk and ink drawing La Bella Principessa), as well as those whose validity has never been in doubt, debates about the integrity of cultural icons are only likely to accelerate. What follows are a handful of handy principles to keep in mind when navigating the impending controversies – five simple rules for spotting a fake masterpiece.\n\nRule 1: Pigments never lie\n\nAlamy Portrait of Saint Jerome (Credit: Alamy)\n\nTo be a successful art forger requires more than technical proficiency and a misplaced ethical compass. It isn't enough to approximate the dibby-dabby dots of a Georges Seurat, say, or the thick expressive swirls of Vincent van Gogh. You need to know your history as well as your chemistry. Anachronistic pigments will give you away every time and were the downfall of German art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi and his wife Helene, who succeeded in selling makeshift modernist masterpieces for millions before a careless squeeze of prefab paint onto their audacious palettes in 2006 sealed their fate.\n\nBeltracchi, whose modus operandi was to create \"new\" works by everyone from Max Ernst to André Derain, rather than recreate lost ones, was always careful to mix his own paints to ensure they contained only ingredients available to whomever he was attempting to impersonate. He only slipped up once. And that was enough. Fabricating a wonky Der Blaue Reiter-ish red landscape of jigsawed horses that he attributed to the German Expressionist Heinrich Campendonk, Beltracchi reached for a readymade tube of paint, which he hadn't realised contained a pinch of titanium white – a relatively new pigment to which Campendonk would not have had access. It was all investigators would need to prove the work, which had sold for €2.8m, was a fake.\n\nBeltracchi was unlucky. The gap between titanium white's availability and its potential use by Campendonk was only a few years. On occasion, the divide is shockingly wide. Analysis of a Portrait of Saint Jerome, once attributed to the Italian master Parmigianino and sold by Sotheby's auction house in 2012 for $842,500, exposed the prevalence throughout the work of phthalocyanine green, a synthetic pigment invented in 1935, four centuries after the 16th-Century Renaissance artist worked. Artists may be visionaries, but they're not time travellers.\n\nRule 2: Keep the past present\n\nMuseum Boijmans Van Beuningan The Men at Emmaus, by Han van Meegeren (Credit: Museum Boijmans Van Beuningan)\n\nIt is uplifting to believe that one's value, as a person, is not tethered to the past. Not so with art. A painting, sculpture, or drawing without a heavy history is not, alas, more inspiring for its lack of baggage. It is suspicious. Or rather, it should be. All too often, greed can interfere in the clear-sightedness of assessing the authenticity of a painting or sculpture. Things have histories we want them to have. That was certainly the case with a succession of phoney Vermeers that issued from the workshop of a Dutch portraitist, Han van Meegeren – one of the most prolific and successful forgers of the 20th Century. Desperate to believe that the miraculous appearance of canvases, including a depiction of Christ and The Men at Emmaus, might be lost masterpieces from the same hand that made Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Milkmaid, collectors were blind to the glaring absence of any trace of the paintings' provenance – their prior ownership, exhibition history, and proof of sales. Everyone was fooled.\n\nIn authenticating the painting in the Burlington Magazine, one expert insisted \"in no other picture by the great Master of Delft do we find such sentiment, such a profound understanding of the Bible story – a sentiment so nobly human expressed through the medium of the highest art\". But it was all a lie. In a remarkable twist, Van Meegeren eventually chose to expose himself as a fraudster shortly after the end of World War Two, after being charged by Dutch authorities with the crime of selling a Vermeer – therefore a national treasure – to the Nazi official Hermann Göring. To prove his innocence, if innocence it might be called, and demonstrate that he had merely sold a worthless fake of his own forging, not a real Old Master, Van Meegeren performed the extraordinary feat of whisking up a fresh masterpiece from thin air before the experts' astonished eyes. Voilà, Vermeer.\n\nThe Hay Wain, by John Constable (Credit: BBC)\n\nMore recently, in a 2017 episode of BBC's popular arts programme Fake or Fortune?, presenter Philip Mould's long-held hunch that a painting he once sold for £35,000 was really a priceless original by the English Romantic artist John Constable – an alternative, and previously undocumented, view of the landscape artist's 1821 masterpiece The Hay Wain – was dramatically confirmed after Mould and fellow presenter Fiona Bruce excavated long-buried financial records. Having traced the painting's ownership back to a sale by the artist's son, the team recalculated the canvass true value to be £2m, proving that some pasts are worth hanging onto.\n\nRule 3: Squint\n\nArtists' gestures – their simultaneously studied and instinctive brushwork and draughtsmanship – are nothing less than fingerprints writ large across canvases and works on paper. One artist's lightness of touch and another's sturdiness of stroke are exceedingly tricky to falsify, especially if you are conscious that every twitch of your brush and jot of your pen will be scrutinised by suspicious eyes and cutting-edge equipment. Pressure under pressure is hard to maintain, an obstacle that the British forger Eric Hebborn (who died under suspicious circumstances in Rome in 1996 after a career spent counterfeiting more than 1,000 works attributed to everyone from Mantegna to Tiepolo, Poussin to Piranesi) overcame with alcohol.\n\nBy all accounts, brandy was Hebborn's tipple of choice for calming his rattling nerves. It allowed him to inhabit, without inhibition, the mind and muscle of whichever old master he was channelling. Whereas fakes from the hands of Beltracchi and Van Meegeren have since been found under closer inspection to be riddled with incoherent gestures, the fluidity of drawings falsified by the tipsy Hebborn in his heyday in the 1970s and 80s continues to confound the experts. To this day, institutions that possess works that passed through his hands refuse to accept they are all fakes, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's pen and ink drawing View of the Temples of Venus and of Diana in Baia from the South, a work it still insists is from the circle of Jan Brueghel the Elder. What do you think?\n\nRule 4: Go deeper\n\nGetty Images Still life with meadow flowers and roses, by Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhen the analysis of pigments, provenance, and paintbrush pressure still leaves you stumped, it may be necessary to dive a little deeper. For 20 years since the 1990s, the authenticity of a still life purportedly by Vincent van Gogh was serially confirmed and refuted by experts. To some, the garish reds and submarine blues that echoed eerily from the bouquet of roses, daisies, and wildflowers didn't have the ring of truth and seemed at odds with the painter's palette. The absence of any ownership record for the painting didn't help.\n\nBut an X-ray undertaken in 2012 put questions to rest when it revealed that the artist, pinching pennies, reused a canvas on which he had created another image entirely – one to which he makes explicit reference in a letter from January 1886. \"This week\", Van Gogh remarked to his brother Theo, \"I painted a large thing with two nude torsos – two wrestlers… and I really like doing that.\" As if proleptically anticipating the ensuing scholarly wrangle over the work's authenticity that the painting would in time trigger, the static tussle of the two athletes, trapped beneath paint for over a century, not only rescued the work from unfair allegations of illegitimacy, it created a kind of fresh composite painting, a vivid compression – a freeze frame of a restless mind forever scuffling with itself, desperate to survive.\n\nRule 5: It's the little things that give you away\n\nAs a final safeguard in authenticating a work of art, run the spell check. Doing so would have saved the collector Pierre Lagrange $17m – the price he paid in 2007 for an otherwise compelling forgery of a small 12x18in (30x46cm) painting falsely attributed to the American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock. Famous for his drippy style, Pollock has a surprisingly legible signature, an unmistakable \"c\" before the final \"k\". The skipped consonant would do more than expose a single forgery; it would shatter the reputation of an entire gallery.\n\nThe sloppy signature was just one of many missed red flags in works falsely attributed to Rothko, De Kooning, Motherwell and others that the Knoedler & Co gallery, one of New York's oldest and most esteemed art institutions, succeeded in selling for $80m. The fraudulent works had been supplied by a dubious dealer who claimed they came from an enigmatic collector, \"Mr X\". Just before the scandal erupted in the press, the gallery closed its doors after 165 years, while the suspected perpetrator of the fakes, a self-taught Chinese septuagenarian by the name of Pei-Shen Qian, who had operated from a forger's workshop in Queens, vanished; he later turned up in China.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'\n\n6 days ago Share Save Dayna Camilleri-Clarke Share Save\n\nAlamy\n\nThe tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\n\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\n\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page, Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\n\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’s Blue Lagoon is a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\n\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\n\nViewing Malta Comino's Blue Lagoon is one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations (Credit: Viewing Malta)\n\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\n\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\n\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds, protesting what they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\n\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\n\nAlamy Locals hope that the new daily visitor cap will help with the island's overtourism issues (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\n\nThey go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed… Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference – Joanne Gatt\n\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations to combat overtourism. Venice has introduced entry fees for day-trippers, while Athens has capped daily visitor numbers to the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\n\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\n\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking.\n\nFew images are as indelible as the sight of candy-coloured tulips bursting through the dark winter ground. But in the Netherlands – the world's largest exporter of the magical bloom – venerating tulips is a way of life. In the weeks leading from icy winter to spring, rows of flowers stud the country's landscape in technicolour streaks, most famously in the Bollenstreek \"Bulb Region\", stretching between the towns of Haarlem and Leiden, arching towards the North Sea. And with tulips come tourists; eager to experience the blooms for themselves.\n\nThe SpeciaList Nienke Panis-Ringersma is the owner of the photography and Dutch culture blog Tulips in Holland, which now also shares its tulip photos and weekly flower updates via X, Instagram and most recently TikTok. She is a licensed national tour guide, and her husband says she eats, sleeps and dreams tulips.\n\nWe spoke to Nienke Panis-Ringersma, the lens behind the popular Dutch-based tulip photography blog, Tulips in Holland, to find the best tulip bloom experiences in the Netherlands. \"People in the Netherlands are very down to earth,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose images and tulip facts receive thousands of likes per month on Facebook. \"They are quite used to the flower fields. You know when it's tourist season, because the roads are clogged with people on a bike who are not used to riding bikes.\"\n\nNonetheless, Panis-Ringersma adores her nation's iconic bulb flower – enough to have made it her career. \"I think it's the excitement,\" she says. \"It starts around December when we can buy tulips in the florist shops. And around the third weekend of January, we celebrate National Tulip Day. Around 300,000 tulips are placed on the museum square in Amsterdam with a beautiful backdrop of the Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum. It's the start of many tulip festivals leading up to the start of spring. It's a magical place and I love the flower, the fragrance. Every tulip is unique. There is a great story to tell.\"\n\nHere are Nienke Panis-Ringersma's favourite ways to experience tulip season in the Netherlands.\n\nSerghei Starus / Alamy Stock Photo A stop at the iconic Keukenhof Gardens in Lisse is obligatory for any tulip lover visiting the Netherlands (Credit: Serghei Starus / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n1. Best overall: Keukenhof\n\n\"So, you ask for absolutely number one place? Visit Keukenhof,\" says Panis-Ringersma.\n\nEstablished in 1949, Keukenhof Gardens is undoubtedly the most popular tulip experience in the Netherlands; its lushly landscaped \"inspirational\" tulip gardens and windmills drawing over a million visitors each year during its eight-week season. \"Around 7 million bulbs are planted by hands, not by machine, every year,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose budding love for tulips was ignited by childhood visits to Keukenhof, where her grandfather volunteered as a ticket taker. \"It's the most beautiful spring garden in the world.\"\n\nResponsible Flower Viewing Tourists, take note; in the Netherlands, it's illegal to park near or walk through tulip fields. \"Flower fields are commercial fields,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can damage crops by entering with your normal shoes, when you bring in bacteria, especially the hyacinths are very sensitive to that. And you don't want to have people over in the fields taking photos, picking flowers over there. Some tourists think that the fields are for there for them.\"\n\nVisitors enjoy a wide variety of experiences at Keukenhof including picnics, flower exhibitions and didactic \"whisper boat\" cruises through the gardens, where contemporary art sculptures dot the grounds. But plan ahead; Keukenhof is open for just two months, usually from the first day of Spring to the first week of May, depending on the weather (in 2025, 20 March to 11 May). \"The best time to go is the $1m question,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's different every year… right now we have an extremely warm winter. I think the best time to visit for this year is around the middle of April.\"\n\nWebsite: https://keukenhof.nl/en/ Address: Stationsweg 166A 2161 AM Lisse Contact: info@keukenhof.nl Instagram: @visitkeukenhof\n\nfamveld / Alamy Stock Photo The Bloemencorso parade of exquisitely decorated flower floats marches through the Bollenstreek, creating a vibrant Springtime atmosphere (Credit: famveld / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n2. Best cultural experience: Catching the Bloemencorso Flower Parade\n\nTo truly get swept up in the excitement of tulip season, be sure to catch the Bloemencorso Flower Parade.\n\n\"A flower parade is a very festive flower festival,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's about 20 different floats, marching bands, cars very lavishly decorated with all kinds of flowers, people enjoying themselves, street entertainment… every town is a very festive atmosphere.\"\n\nInsider Bloemencorso Flower Parade tip Panis-Ringersma encourages visitors to also catch the events surrounding parade day. \"Not many people know that there's the Night Parade on Friday evening,\" she says. \"It's in Noordwijkerhout, a very small town. People gather there to look at the parade floats, have a drink and have something to eat outside on the terrace.\" During the Night Parade, the floats are illuminated, creating a magical atmosphere. And on float Construction Days (Wednesday to Friday), spectators can watch volunteers decorate the floats with thousands of flowers. On Sunday afternoon, after the parade, the floats are displayed for one last time in the city of Haarlem.\n\nThe Bloemencorso parade takes place each year on the third Saturday of April, marching along the road from Noordwijk to Haarlem, through the Bollenstreek and past Keukenhof. \"It's a full day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"People line up at least three four lines thick to see. Some people get their seats ready at least three hours before the parade to make sure… it's like a Disney parade. People are sitting down on the streets waiting for the parade to pass by.\"\n\nPanis-Ringersma's tip: watch from Noordwijk. \"Lots of people try to see the parade around Keukenhof because it passes the gardens,\" she says. \"But that's an extremely busy spot. Go to Noordwijk early in the morning. It's a beautiful seaside town.\"\n\nWhile waiting for the parade, feast on Dutch Stroopwafel cookies, or have lunch at Panis-Ringersma's casual Dutch dining pick, Hudson Restaurant. \"It's a very festive day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"Every town is having markets … it's an absolute must-see for people traveling to the Netherlands.\"\n\nAFF/Alamy Stock Photo For the best – legal – immersive tulip experiences, visit a tulip farm like the Tulip Barn in Hillegom with its 750,000 tulips (Credit: AFF / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n3. Best interactive experience: Visiting a tulip farm\n\nFor those who aren't satisfied merely admiring the blooms from afar, Panis-Ringersma suggests visiting a tulip farm. \"Because everybody really wants to go into the fields, which is not allowed,\" she says. \"So, please go to a tulip farm where it is allowed!\"\n\nPanis-Ringersma's three farm recommendations are all found in the heart of the Bollenstreek. \"All three are founded by bulb growers,\" she says. \"So, they know absolutely what they are doing. They're all a very hands-on experience.\"\n\nThe family-run Tulip Experience in Noordwijkerhout is Panis-Ringersma's first pick; home to nearly 1 million tulips. \"You can go to the field where you can see at least 700 different types of tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can visit the tulip market with all kinds of products made of tulips or with tulips on it. You can pick your own tulips. It's a very fun experience.\" What sort of tulip products? \"Beer with tulips, tulip vodka, tulip Aperol Spritz, soap smelling of tulips, vases, napkins with tulips, wallets with tulips,\" she says. \"If you can name it, everything with tulips.\"\n\nAlternatively, visit Tulip Barn in Hillegom just 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, where visitors can immerse themselves in the 750,000 tulips sprawling across the farm's gardens and production field. \"They are more focused on making Instagrammable photos,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"So, for a bit younger target audience.\"\n\nHeading further south, Panis-Ringersma also likes De Tulperij in Voorhout. \"You can go together with the bulb grower,\" she says. \"You're walking into the fields. He will dig up some tulip bulbs and will show you how they are growing and what they are doing each year to make them grow. It's a very interesting environment.\"\n\nWebsite: https://tulipexperienceamsterdam.nl Address: Delfweg 37, 2211 VK Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands Phone: +31651368784 Instagram: @tulipexperienceamsterdam\n\nfamveld / Alamy Stock Photo The Bloemencorso parade of exquisitely decorated flower floats marches through the Bollenstreek, creating a vibrant Springtime atmosphere (Credit: famveld / Alamy Stock Photo))\n\n4. Best for kids: Tulip picking\n\nFor visitors with antsy kids (and a car), Panis-Ringersma loves tulip picking in the Bollenstreek. \"Not in the regular fields where you can say as you're walking, 'Oh, I like this one!'\" she says. \"No, just go to a to a picking farm and pick your own tulips.\"\n\nTulip Road Trip Map When roaming the Bollenstreek, it's helpful to have a plan – like Panis-Ringersma's helpful tulip road trip map; perfect for navigating the area by car or by bike. \"The green map square is Keukenhof,\" she explains. \"All the yellow stars are flower fields. The pink line is a long route among various flower fields; the blue is a route towards the beach. And when you drive by bike or by car, you will absolutely find tulip fields in bloom regardless the time of season during springtime.\"\n\nThere are several picking farms in the Bollenstreek area, but Panis-Ringersma recommends heading to Annemieke's Pluktuin, a tulip nursery in Hillegom run by husband-and-wife team, Annemieke and Pieter. \"Pluktuin is literally 'picking garden',\" explains Panis-Ringersma. \"Tulip picking is an absolutely brilliant experience, especially when you go with children to walk into the field and get the tulip with the bulb and you can take the bulb and the tulip with you back home or to the hotel.\"\n\nWebsite: https://www.annemiekespluktuin.nl Address: Haarlemmerstraat 15A, 2182 HA Hillegom, Netherlands Phone: +31653839979 Instagram: @pickinggardenholland\n\nNini Kraan / Alamy Stock Photo Head to the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen to see rare historic bulbs in living colour (Credit: Nini Kraan / Alamy Stock Photo)\n\n5. Best for tulip aficionados: Hortus Bulborum\n\nFor Panis-Ringersma, whose passion for tulip photography led her to become an expert in tulip horticulture, the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen is a sacred institute of learning.\n\nDid You Know? \"An interesting fact about tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's not native to the Netherlands but people think it is.\" Tulips are, in fact, native to the Himalayas, where they flourished as a small red mountain flower before being brought to Turkey in the 1400s. \"People from Turkey went to the Himalayas and took this magical flower,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They thought, 'Oh, it's very interesting. Let's see if we can make it taller or different colours.' At the end of the 16th Century, it came to the Netherlands. People would have thought, 'Okay, it's a very ugly bulb, but there comes a beautiful flower out of it.'\"\n\n\"It's like a living museum,\" she says. \"Tulips entered the Netherlands around the 16th Century. And people loved them from the very beginning. And right now, there is one place in the Netherlands that keep the bulbs alive from the 16th Century and later on. So, this is a place where you can visit and find the oldest bulbs of the Netherlands still blooming.\"\n\nThe Hortus Bulborum houses more than 4,500 varieties of historical spring bulbous plants, from tulips to daffodils to hyacinths, which are rarely cultivated in modern day. The garden's star bulbs include a specimen of Fritillaria Persica, dating to 1557, and the ancient 16th-Century tulip Duc van Tol Red and Yellow.\n\n\"So, you can visit and it's a very small garden,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They have great apple pie! So absolutely visit and drink some coffee with apple pie over there and have a look at all the different kinds of flowers.\"\n\nWebsite: https://hortus-bulborum.nl/en/ Address: Zuidkerkenlaan 23A, 1906 AC Limmen, Netherlands Phone: +31617291643 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/hortusbulborum/\n\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Here's how to minimise your impact\n\n5 days ago Share Save Thea de Gallier Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs polar tourism surges, experts warn of its environmental impact. From transport choices to local food, here's how to visit responsibly while protecting fragile ecosystems.\n\nI first learned of Greenland's existence from a world map pinned on my childhood bedroom wall. Decades later, I finally made it to the capital, Nuuk. I'd long been fascinated by pictures of the brightly coloured wooden houses lining its rocky shores – red, yellow, green and blue against an icy backdrop. Small icebergs floated just offshore and the absence of trees gave a stark, otherworldly feel. I looked forward to experiencing the crisp, biting air, exploring Inuit art at the Nuuk Kunstmuseum and maybe, if I was lucky, spotting some seals or a passing whale.\n\nI'm not the only one entranced by Greenland's icy beauty: between 2018-2023, tourism to the country grew by 46%, with 131,767 visitors arriving in 2023. Much of this surge is due to the increasing number of cruise ships navigating Arctic waters.\n\nAccording to the Arctic Council, ships entering the Arctic Polar Code area – a regulated maritime zone around the North Pole – increased by 37% between 2013 and 2024. Many cruise operators, like Hurtigruten, Swan Hellenic and Ponant, offer routes encompassing Iceland, Svalbard and Greenland, with the latter expecting visitor numbers to keep growing thanks to a 2024 airport expansion in Nuuk and two more international airports set to be built by 2026.\n\nMeanwhile on the opposite side of the planet, Antarctica is seeing a similar tourism boom. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports a steady rise in visitors since the 1990s. In the 2022-23 season, 104,897 people visited the continent, rising to 124,262 last year. More than 80,000 of those set foot on Antarctic land – an alarming statistic for conservationists who warn that human presence can disrupt fragile ecosystems, alter animal behaviour and unwittingly bring invasive foreign organisms with them.\n\nAlamy The polar regions are threatened – and travellers can make careful choices to lessen their impact (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs tourism to the poles increases, organisations like the Arctic Council, the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO) and Visit Greenland stress the urgent need to balance economic benefits with environmental responsibility. The lure of the polar regions is undeniable: the near lunar landscapes; the intensity of the blue sky on a freezing, sunny day; the thrill of fresh snow crunching underfoot; and the unique wildlife that calls these places home.\n\nJames Grecian, a marine ecologist at Durham University, UK, and scientist-in-residence at climate advocacy nonprofit Arctic Basecamp, has spent years studying polar wildlife. Last year, he was in Antarctica studying snow petrels – or more specifically, their vomit.\n\nThoughtful Travel Want to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\n\nSnow petrels' stomach oil deposits freeze into solid lumps that contain, when analysed in a lab, data on how their diet has changed over the years, and in turn, what that means about the local ecosystem. \"We can tell a lot about past conditions by taking samples from the environment, or from animals,\" Grecian explains. \"For example, the baleen plates of whales can be taken from dead animals, and the chemical signatures will tell you something about the environmental conditions or what the animal was eating.\"\n\nAs a fairly frequent polar visitor, he understands the appeal of these environments – and also the impact. He notes there are choices we can make to reduce the damage to these vital but threatened regions. Polar tourism is showing no signs of slowing down, but Grecian hopes that, with increased awareness of its drawbacks, visitors can make the most ethical choices possible. Here are his suggestions on how to do that.\n\nJames Grecian Marine ecologist James Grecian has spent years studying polar wildlife (Credit: James Grecian)\n\nPlanes, trains or cruise ships?\n\nFirst of all, you'll need to weigh up your travel options to reach the polar region of your choice.\n\nThe problem with a cruise ship is that you're bringing the hotel and all the services with you,\" he says. \"I've heard stories of towns being quite unhappy about the disruption when lots of people disembark. They get all their meals catered on the ship so they won't go to the local cafes. Contrast that to planes – if you fly into an area, you're going to be staying in local hotels, you're going to be using local tour operators. The communities have a chance to benefit economically. But you need to offset that against the massive carbon emissions of planes.\"\n\nWhile ships may seem a greener alternative to flying, global data suggests otherwise. Aviation accounts for 2.5% of CO2 emissions globally, while shipping contributes slightly more at 3% (although most of that is from cargo ships). There's also the noise pollution issue – the hum of ships' engines has been shown to disrupt whales' echolocation ability.\n\n\"There's a horrible video – an animation based on real blue whale migration tracking, and it's a blue whale caught in shipping lanes,\" says Grecian. \"It's like a pinball in a machine; it keeps turning around and turning back because of the amount of noise that the ships produce.\"\n\nSo what's the alternative?\n\n\"Using trains is about a 90% or 95% reduction in CO2, so from a climate perspective, a train to Norway for the fjords is a better option.\" It is possible – but takes much longer – to reach parts of the Arctic by train, even if flights are required for some of the journey. There's direct trains to Narvik in the Norwegian Arctic from Stockholm; from Trondheim to Bodø in Norway or from Helsinki to Rovaniemi in the north of Finland.\n\nAlamy Many travellers don't realise that there is train access to some parts of the Arctic (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOr you could – if you have the money – charter a small sailing boat. \"I know people in the Falklands who sail to Antarctica fairly regularly,\" says Grecian. \"The cost of [a private charter] probably wouldn't be far off the cost of a berth on a fancy cruise ship.\"\n\nThink before you selfie\n\nPolar wildlife is a big draw for visitors, but Grecian cautions against disturbing the very animals people come to see.\n\n\"You must be appreciative of being a guest in that environment and try to treat it with as much respect as you can,\" says Grecian. \"There can be a tendency these days to try and get selfies with animals and that can cause a lot of disturbance. They're not used to seeing people, so give them space. You shouldn't be trying to chase them down.\"\n\nGrecian recommends patience. \"If you sit quietly, some animals are quite curious. I haven't seen penguins in Antarctica but I have in the Falklands, and they came within 3-4m (10-13ft). So if you're quiet and still, you might get a visitor.\"\n\nLocal guides can also provide essential knowledge – plus Grecian says that sometimes it's about noticing the small things. \"Some people say you should always look up, but if you look down, you can see signs of animals. You might see footprints in the mud, or scat that will give you a suggestion of what animals might have passed through.\"\n\nJames Grecian Polar wildlife is a big draw for visitors, but travellers should be respectful and give animals space (Credit: James Grecian)\n\nConsider eating seal\n\nThat might sound drastic, but if you're visiting on land rather than on a cruise, there is a good reason to eat local products. Transporting supplies to these remote areas carries a significant carbon footprint – globally, food production contributes three billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually.\n\nIn Greenland and parts of Arctic Canada, many Inuit communities still subsistence hunt. Their hunting rights are legally protected in Canada and in Greenland, and are regulated to prevent over-hunting. \"The rights of the Indigenous population to pursue traditional hunting practices is enshrined in law,\" says Grecian. \"The meat of a ring seal or a harp seal in Greenland will have a much lower carbon footprint than imported meat or non-native crops.\"\n\nOf course, your personal comfort levels at the idea of eating seal meat are yours to decide, but bear in mind that if you're visiting a majority-Inuit region like Greenland, the alternatives are limited and local meat is the more environmentally-friendly option – a study comparing the carbon footprint of imported meat and local seal in Greenland found seal had the lowest footprint compared to pork and poultry.\n\nThink outside the box when packing\n\nFor the intrepid travellers planning on camping or venturing off the beaten track, it's vital to have the right gear – and not just the obvious things like base layers, shoe spikes and waterproofs.\n\n\"If you're going somewhere particularly cold or out camping in more remote parts, you can hire gear in the country,\" says Grecian. Not only will it make your suitcase lighter; it'll benefit the local economy.\"\n\nAlamy Plan your trip for May or June to see icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBut when it comes to packing for your visit, Grecian offers tips on some practical but often forgotten items. \"Nasal spray,\" he says. \"Cold environments tend to be dry, so the inside of your nose can dry out and can bleed.\" And don't underestimate the strength of polar Sun – Grecian recommends taking factor 50 sunscreen. If you're camping or in other basic, remote accommodation, you might want some creature comforts, too: \"On an expedition, coffee is vital for me. On my last trip I took a moka pot and a French press!\"\n\nSync up with nature\n\nGrecian laughs when I tell him that, on my visit to Greenland, I didn't see a single whale. I went in October – the start of winter, just as humpback whales begin their migration to the Caribbean.\n\n\"If there's a specific activity or animal you want, look up their migration patterns,\" he says. And if it's a natural phenomenon, check when it occurs. \"For instance, a lot of people go to Newfoundland in May or June [to see] grass and flowers against the backdrop of icebergs. If you want to see that you have to go at that specific time of year.\"\n\nHis advice underscores a broader idea: polar travel should be guided by what's best for the natural world, not just what looks good on social media.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Bellamy had made an excellent start to his tenure last year, unbeaten in six games and introducing an enterprising new playing style as he led Wales to promotion to the Nations League's top tier.\n\nHis ultimate aim, however, was for Wales to not only qualify for the 2026 World Cup, but to make a more meaningful impact when they get there having meekly exited at the group stage in 2022.\n\nAt pains not to get ahead of himself, Bellamy stressed this week that he and his players dared not look beyond this Kazakhstan game.\n\nThe visitors had been on a 12-match winless run before beating Curacao in a friendly on Wednesday, though they had won against the likes of Denmark and Northern Ireland in recent years.\n\nHaving been embarrassed at home by Armenia in their unsuccessful Euro 2024 qualifying campaign, Wales knew that fixtures against lowly opponents were not always straightforward.\n\nJames had given Wales a 1-0 lead in the 10th minute before they were humiliated 4-2 on that occasion in 2023 but, when he put them in front in the ninth minute here, few inside Cardiff City Stadium would have sensed such an upset was in the offing.\n\nIt was a messy goal, with Wales making a hash of a short corner and Kazakhstan doing an even worse job of clearing it. Liam Cullen did well to regain possession and Davies laid the ball off to James, whose low shot took a deflection and looped in past a wrong-footed Zarutskiy.\n\nThe home crowd might have thought the floodgates would open at that point but, with Joe Rodon heading over and James having a penalty appeal rejected, Wales struggled to really assert themselves on the game.\n\nThen, out of nothing, Kazakhstan were level. Roberts had turned away from Chesnokov's cross when it hit his arm and, after a VAR check, Tagybergen scored his penalty to delight the tiny but proud contingent of away fans.\n\nA relaxed atmosphere had suddenly turned edgy, Welsh fans anxiously wondering if this was going to be one of those nights they had hoped were a thing of the past.\n\nThankfully for them - and the blood pressure of the perpetually pacing, twitchy Bellamy on the touchline - Davies eased those nerves as he nodded into an empty net after Zarutskiy failed to gather Thomas' corner.\n\nZarutskiy made a spectacular save to deny substitute Jordan James, who brought balance to the Welsh midfield, and the Kazakh keeper also repelled a free-kick from Neco Williams.\n\nDespite the frustration of those missed opportunities, Wales kept their cool and, in added time, Thomas supplied a fine low cross for Matondo, whose first-time finish made victory safe.",

Here's how to visit one safely\n\n2 days ago Share Save Anna Fiorentino Share Save\n\nAlamy\n\nWith glaciers disappearing at an alarming rate, 2025 has been named the Year of International Glacier Preservation. Here's how and where to see one responsibly before it's too late.\n\nOn an exceptionally warm July day in 2022, certified mountain guide Andrea Milani took a lunch break from rock climbing near the Italian Dolomites' Passo Fedaia ascent. As he ate pizza with two friends, helicopters circled and ambulance sirens wailed in the distance. A massive chunk (80m wide and 25m high) had just broken off nearby Marmolada glacier, triggering an avalanche of ice, snow and debris. Milani's two friends who'd finished that descent just hours before meeting him were the lucky ones: 11 climbers tragically died that day.\n\n\"Now more than ever, climate change is making glacier travel more dangerous. Rising temperatures mean the snow covering crevasses and seracs becomes less reliable, increasing the risk of hidden hazards,\" says Milani, who guides climbers, skiers, bikers and hikers of all levels safely across Northern Italy with Dolomite Mountains tours.\n\nThe reality is that one-third of glaciers could disappear from climate change by 2050 – and for Marmolada, it's 2040. This is why the United Nations has declared 2025 the International Year of Glaciers' Preservation. It has also set 21 March 2025 as the first annual World Day for Glaciers in partnership with Unesco and the World Meteorological Organization. The initiatives aim to mobilise governments and organisations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and implement climate adaptation strategies to protect the planet's 200,000 glaciers as the Earth warms faster than ever before.\n\n\"Worldwide, human-caused climate change has melted so much ice from glaciers that the meltwater has raised global sea level 8cm since 1900,\" says Patrick Gonzalez, former principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service and assistant director for climate and biodiversity of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nSadly, scenes like the one at Marmolada have played out across the planet time and again. Over the past two decades, Bolivia's 18,000-year-old Chacaltaya glacier, once the world's highest ski resort, has melted completely. Italy and Switzerland were forced to redraw their shared borders last autumn due to the melt of the Matterhorn in Zermatt. And at Muir Glacier in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park, climate change has melted away a layer of ice as tall as New York's One World Trade Center.\n\nAlamy Italy's Marmolada glacier could disappear by 2040 as temperatures continue to rise (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThese slow-moving, fast-retreating dense masses of ice, snow and rock that have accumulated in the mountains over centuries on every continent except Australia are glaring evidence that man-made climate change exists. If all glaciers were to melt today, sea level would increase by a half a metre, leaving entire cities underwater, devastating ecosystems and depriving two billion people of drinking water.\n\nThoughtful Travel Want to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\n\nBut travellers can still visit glaciers like Marmolada safely – they just need to know how. In fact, research has shown that seeing a glacier in nature can prompt us to protect the planet. Glaciers are now a symbol of its fragility, reminding us how, through simple cost-effective solutions like walking, biking and purchasing solar and wind energy, we can help limit global warming.\n\nWhile 91% of glaciers are in Antarctica, many can be found in more accessible parts of the world, so go visit one; it's easier than ever, just make sure you proceed with caution.\n\nWapta Icefield, British Columbia, Canada\n\nMountaineers, skiers and nature lovers from all over the world flock to the Canadian Rockies for irresistible high alpine terrain, and that includes the Columbia Icefields. Straddling the majestic Banff and Jasper national parks on the Continental Divide, it's all that's left of an ice mass that once enveloped most of western Canada's mountains. Ride the Ice Explorer train to the Athabasca Glacier to walk the glass-floored Columbia Icefield Skywalk with sweeping views over the waterfalls coming from the Sunwapta Valley's glacier and the famous mountain goats of Glacier Lookout along the cliffs.\n\nShaun King Columbia Icefield visitors can walk on the glacier and learn about its geological features (Credit: Shaun King)\n\nIf you are bold enough to climb the glacier, go with an experienced Yamnuska Mountain Adventures guide. You'll learn about glacier dynamics, route finding and risk management on one of the largest icefields in North America. It's an adventure that demands respect and preparation, says Yamnuska mountain guide Jesse de Montigny.\n\n\"The primary danger is crevasses – deep, often hidden cracks in the ice that can be difficult to detect, especially when covered by snow,\" says de Montigny. \"Weather conditions can change rapidly, creating whiteout conditions that make navigation difficult. Proper rope systems, glacier travel techniques and crevasse rescue knowledge are essential for mitigating risk in these environments.\"\n\nMendenhall, Alaska\n\nMendenhall is one of more than 100,000 glaciers in what's appropriately called the \"Glacier State\". Inside the Tongass National Forest, 19km from Juneau along the Alaska-Canada border in south-eastern Alaska, is the Juneau Icefield. It's also one of Alaska's only glaciers that can be reached for viewing by car or shuttle; start your adventure at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center.\n\nSince it has been melting excessively in recent years, you'll need to join a helicopter tour to get more than a look out at the glacier; to hike it (or fly over it) try Alaska Shore Excursions. (The glacier's ice caves are no longer safely accessible.)\n\nAlamy Mendenhall is one of Alaska's only glaciers that can be reached for viewing by car or shuttle (Credit: Alamy)\n\nNote: As of 13 March, the majority of the glacier's Forest Service park rangers and staff were laid off due to federal cuts, despite the tourist season commencing in April. Meanwhile the Juneau Icefield is melting five times faster than it was in the 1980s.\n\nMarmolada, Italian Dolomites\n\nIt's worth overcoming your fear of heights for the \"Queen of the Dolomites\", located within Northern Italy's 12 interconnected Dolomiti Superski resorts. Take the cable car up, and whether you ride back down or ski the glacier, make a stop at Europe's highest museum to learn about World War One tunnels dug by Austro-Hungarian soldiers who lived there for months in their glacier \"Ice City\".\n\nCrevasses can be sneaky, hiding under thin layers of snow, so knowing how to spot and test them is crucial – Andrea Milani\n\nIf you decide to brave mountaineering or climbing, be sure to hire a guide. Miliani always tells his Dolomite Mountains tour groups to stay aware and read the environment. \"Glacier mountaineering isn't just about skill; it's about preparation, experience and respect for the environment, he says. His advice? Distance yourself from the next climber (by 8-12m) moving along the rope at a steady pace and avoid sudden movements that could throw off your balance. Check the map and the weather (the colder the better), and most importantly, the avalanche forecast. Wear the right gear, pack a self-rescue kit, GPS, compass, altimeter and radio or satellite phone. And don't leave home without taking a first-aid course.\n\n\"Crevasses can be sneaky, hiding under thin layers of snow, so knowing how to spot and test them is crucial,\" he adds. \"If you're crossing a snow bridge [an arc formed by snow across a crevasse] make sure it's stable before stepping onto it. And let's not forget seracs and avalanche zones – don't hang around under them longer than necessary.\"\n\nMer de Glace, France\n\nIt's just got easier to visit Chamonix's Mer de Glace (also known as Montenvers), only second in size in the Alps to Switzerland's Aletsch Glacier. This iridescent ice aqua glacier – transmitting a blue wavelength and absorbing all the other colours – has become harder to view after losing 6m of thickness a year.\n\nAlamy The Mer de Glace ice cave has to be dug out each summer since the glacier shifts as much as 70m every year (Credit: Alamy)\n\nSince last year, though, visitors' can now see Mer de Glace via a new gondola from a 1,913m-high panoramic platform. There's an on-site restaurant, coffee shop, museum and even an ice cave that visitors can still walk through – originally cut into the glacier in 1992 by high mountain guides and now re-dug every summer because, like icebergs, glaciers are always moving, more than ever now. Access the gondola by taking the train up the mountain from Chamonix town centre.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Rags-to-riches hero or villainous torturer? The truth about Henry VIII's scheming right-hand man Thomas Cromwell\n\n2 days ago Share Save Clare McHugh Share Save\n\nNational Portrait Gallery\n\nWith her award-winning Wolf Hall series of books, Hilary Mantel made Tudor bad guy Thomas Cromwell sympathetic. But as TV adaptation Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light premieres in the US, the question is: did she also 'sidestep crucial matters'?\n\nNearly 500 years after his death, Thomas Cromwell lives again, reborn in the popular imagination thanks to novelist Hilary Mantel, and her Wolf Hall trilogy. For decades, historians piled layer after layer of interpretation upon Henry VIII's astute chief minister, a key figure in the Reformation, when King Henry broke from the Catholic Church to establish his own Church of England. But now, with the emergence of Mantel's fictional Cromwell – so attractive, so splendidly presented – the real man is in danger of being buried forever.\n\nGoing forward, Cromwell's name will likely call to mind the lean, canny look of actor Mark Rylance – star of the television adaptations of the Wolf Hall series – rather than the grumpy, heavy-jowled visage captured by artist Hans Holbein in a portrait done from life circa 1534. And a figure once counted among history's villains will retain the glow of Mantel's revisionist high regard for many years to come.\n\nNational Portrait Gallery The famous Hans Holbein portrait of Cromwell portrays him as a grumpy individual (Credit: National Portrait Gallery)\n\nStarting on 23 March, US audiences can watch Rylance play Cromwell, alongside Damian Lewis as King Henry, one more time. Six hours of Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, based on the third and final book, make up the last tranche of episodes of the BBC's lavish costume drama. The script takes the complicated story of Cromwell's fall, culminating in his execution for treason in 1540 after six years as the King's right-hand man, and renders it (relatively) easy to follow. Especially impressive is the dialogue, often lifted directly from Mantel's text. The author, who died of a stroke in 2022, had a gift for rendering 16th-Century speech in a non-risible way. (The Wolf Hall novels have also been adapted into two plays.)\n\nAlthough critics consider The Mirror and the Light to be the least successful of the novels – it's the only one of the three not to win the Booker Prize – the TV version received rapturous reviews when broadcast in the UK last autumn. The Guardian's five-star review proclaimed: \"The final instalment of Hilary Mantel's masterpiece is the most intricate television you are ever likely to see. It is so beautifully made it's breathtaking.\"\n\nFact v fiction\n\nBut where do sumptuous production values end, and the facts begin? Such questions have accompanied Mantel's project from the start. Tracy Borman, Chief Historian at Historic Royal Palaces and author of 2015's Thomas Cromwell: The Untold Story of Henry VIII's Most Faithful Servant, tells the BBC about the impact Mantel's first Tudor novel, Wolf Hall, had on her upon its publication in 2008. \"All through my education, from early school days until university, I was taught that Henry VIII's chief minister was a grasping, ruthless, cynical henchman, driven by greed and power. Then I read Wolf Hall and it gave such a different perspective… I was inspired to write a non-fiction biography so that I could find out where the truth lay.\"\n\nResearching her book, Borman discovered a sharp-witted and enterprising Cromwell, as Mantel did, and realised just how thorough the novelist had been in mining primary sources for innumerable details, including Tudor swear words, Cromwell's favourite wines, and the names of his servants. \"Granted, she took artistic license when she needed to,\" Borman says. \"Notably in downplaying Cromwell's role in Anne Boleyn's execution, and in making him something of a heartthrob at court.\"\n\nSamantha Rogers, who teaches early modern history at Vanderbilt University, agrees. \"There are a great many popular novels about the Tudors I can't bear to read,\" she tells the BBC. \"Mantel's work is the gold standard – well-researched and rooted in history. However, to paint a largely sympathetic portrait of Cromwell, she does sidestep some crucial matters.\"\n\nBBC/ Playground Entertainment Mark Rylance plays Cromwell in the BBC TV adaptations of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall novels (Credit: BBC/ Playground Entertainment)\n\nRogers notes that when King Henry wanted to rid himself of his second wife, Anne Boleyn, the court musician Mark Smeaton, under torture, implicated her in serious crimes – adultery with five men including her own brother. Cromwell most certainly supervised his torture, and yet in the taut and chilling Bring Up the Bodies, the second of Mantel's Tudor novels, Smeaton is merely threatened, put in a dark closet, and never physically assaulted.\n\nLiterary critic and biographer Megan Marshall, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Margaret Fuller: A New American Life, explains to the BBC how, in writing about a historical figure, both a biographer and novelist \"will pluck out what concerns us, and what concerns the audience… although the novelist likely has a more conscious agenda than a biographer\".\n\nMantel's view of Cromwell is inevitably coloured by her personal perspective. She made no secret of her rejection, during adolescence, of the Catholic faith she was brought up in, nor her scorn for the representation of Cromwell and his staunchly Catholic nemesis Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt's play A Man for All Seasons, which, as a film, won the Oscar for best picture in 1967. In Bolt's telling, Cromwell is the big baddie, both ruthless and underhanded in his methods. More, Lord High Chancellor of England, and later venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, is the hero, executed for refusing to swear an oath recognising the monarch as the supreme head of the Church in England. More's eloquent resistance, and faithfulness to the dictates of his own conscience, resonated amid the counter-culture of the 1960s.\n\nMost of Henry VIII's court were blue-blooded nobles, then in comes Cromwell, the son of a blacksmith from a seedy part of London, and he takes it by storm. It's a story as dramatic as it is seductive – Tracy Borman\n\nEamon Duffy, emeritus professor of history at the University of Cambridge, has accused Mantel of going too far with her demythologising of More. He says that she made More into a monster, \"a torturer and a misogynist whose wife and womenfolk were afraid of him,\" he said in a recent interview with the Idler magazine, adding, \"I think that [More] portrayal was the least successful bit of Wolf Hall.\"\n\nA hero for our times\n\nYet as she drags More down, Mantel is simultaneously rehabilitating Cromwell. And in the process, does she not give readers a Cromwell that fits the 21st Century? A hero for our time? Rogers believes that she does, pointing out that writer and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, with his hit musical Hamilton, recast Founding Father Alexander Hamilton in a similar way. \"Both are appealing, scrappy guys who come from nothing,\" says Rogers. Appealing, in other words, to audiences preoccupied by the structural barriers – be they based on class, race, wealth or gender – that prevent people today from flourishing.\n\nAlamy The 1966 film Man for All Seasons depicted Thomas More (played by Paul Scofield, pictured right) as a hero and Cromwell as a villain (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBorman concurs. \"Henry VIII's court was far from being a meritocracy: most of its members were blue-blooded nobles and the top positions were practically hereditary. Then in comes Cromwell, the son of a blacksmith from a seedy part of London, and he takes the court – and its king – by storm. It's a story as dramatic as it is seductive.\"\n\nWhat Wolf Hall leaves out, however, is of particular interest to the leading Cromwell scholar working today. Diarmaid MacCulloch, emeritus professor of history at the University of Oxford, and author of 2018's Thomas Cromwell: A Life, argues that rather than Cromwell pursuing the country's religious change for political ends, he was a sincere Protestant, determined throughout his years in the King's service to bring church reform to England. And while MacCulloch greatly admires Mantel's novels, in a 2018 interview with the podcast History Extra, he said that \"the one thing she played down… is the religion\". He added: \"Perhaps for a modern novel-reading audience, you simply can't do it.\"\n\nHistorical fiction may indeed reveal as much about the time it is written in, as the time it is written about. Mantel referred to this duality in her Reith Lectures on the craft, presented for the BBC in 2017, along with the many challenges of weaving fiction out of fact. \"The pursuit of the past makes you aware, whether you are novelist or historian, of your own fallibility and inbuilt bias,\" she declared. It's in the gaps in the official record that a writer of fiction can do her most valuable work, she said.\n\nThat audiences – readers, theatregoers, TV viewers – all find Mantel's Cromwell so compelling testifies not only to her skill at filling in gaps, but to her love for the protagonist – the witty, affectionate, energetic, all-seeing polymath – she contrived after emerging from the archives. \"When I sat down to write at last,\" Mantel recalled in a 2012 essay, \"it was with relish for his company.\"\n\nThe Mirror and the Light premieres on 23 March on PBS Masterpiece in the US and is available now to stream on BBC iPlayer in the UK\n\n--",

        "content": "'We use them every day': In some parts of the US, the clack of typewriter keys can still be heard\n\n15 hours ago Share Save Chris Baraniuk Share Save\n\nErnesto Roman (Credit: Ernesto Roman)\n\nComputers and smartphones might be where most writing is done these days, but typewriters still have work to do in the US.\n\nPretty much every day, another customer clutching an old typewriter will walk into Mike Marr's shop in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Marr carefully looks the machine over. Invariably, it will be a total mess. Made decades ago, the hunk of heavy metal bristling with moving parts is now laced with years of grime. The keys are too stiff. Or maybe the paper that's supposed to glide through it keeps getting stuck.\n\n\"Do you think you can get it going again?\" the customer will ask, a touch of anxiety in their voice. Marr, who has been repairing typewriters for more than 20 years, will say he'll give it his best shot.\n\n\"When they come in and pick that typewriter up, just seeing their smile is everything to us,\" he says. Even in the year 2025, a century and a half after the first commercially successful typewriter was introduced to the American public, surprising numbers of people in the US are still using these machines. And not just for fun – many of Marr's customers are businesses. \"We're still servicing probably 20 to 25 typewriters a week,\" he says. He employs three other people in his shop to keep up with the demand. \"Isn't that crazy?\"\n\nIn today's world, internet-connected computers and smartphones are king. They're used for the vast majority of business tasks and transactions. But here and there, in little offices and warehouses, you can still find a well-worn typewriter lingering in the corner. A machine whose keys have been pressed many thousands, if not millions, of times. To this day, typewriters print names on forms. They put addresses on envelopes. They fill out cheques. And the people who use them, generally speaking, have no intention of switching to a computer any time soon – at least for those particular tasks.\n\nIt was back in 1953 that Marr's grandfather founded the business he now runs: Marr Office Equipment. Decades ago, a call came through from IBM. The tech giant was looking for a new typewriter distributor in the northeast of the US. Marr's father and uncle, in charge at the time, were over the moon. \"That was the biggest thing that could ever happen to them,\" says Marr. \"Trailer trucks would just pull up and unload IBM after IBM. They'd already be sold. We couldn't keep up with it.\"\n\nErnesto Roman Mike Marr has been repairing typewriters for more than 20 years and still sees dozens being brought into his shop in Rhode Island every week (Credit: Ernesto Roman)\n\nMarr Office Equipment's heyday may be long gone but Marr still knows typewriter users all over his local area. He mentions one that is about a 10 minute drive away, in south Providence – a law firm named Tomasso & Tomasso, co-owned by brothers John and Ray, both attorneys. \"We sound exactly alike,\" says John, laughing as he introduces himself over the phone. Do they actually still rely on typewriters? Absolutely. \"There's not a day that goes by that we don't use them,\" says Tomasso. \"This is really still the best way.\"\n\nThe firm's office has three typewriters, John says and his colleagues still use them to type up cheques and fill in legal forms to ensure the details on those documents are legible. Plus, there's a security angle. It's very hard to hack a typewriter since they are not connected to the internet. In 2013, jaw-dropping details emerged about the extent of US intelligence agency surveillance programmes. This prompted the Russian Federal Guard Service (FSO) to revert to typewriters in an attempt to evade eavesdropping. German officials were also reported to be considering a similar move in 2014. (During the Cold War, Soviet spies actually developed techniques for snooping on electric typewriter activity, a form of \"keylogging\" technology – where the keystrokes inputted on a keyboard are captured. US operatives also reconstructed text from typewriter ribbons – meaning that even typewriters aren't completely safe.)\n\nI ask Tomasso whether there are downsides to using the typewriter – isn't it harder to correct mistakes? No, he replies, he has a model with an \"eraser ribbon\" that seamlessly covers up a mistype. Plus, the typewriters are inexpensive to run. Replacement ink ribbons cost around $5 (£4), he estimates. Replacement printer ink cartridges can cost several times that.\n\nBesides, Tomasso loves to see his writing materialise instantly on the page in front of him. \"There's more of a sense of accomplishment than just letters that appear on a screen,\" he explains. \"It's one of those amazing devices that just makes our life better – I think that's the purpose of technology.\"\n\nAs a person who repairs typewriters, that's always running at the back of my mind – why are businesses still using these things? – Paul Lundy\n\nFurther west, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is a real estate agency called Jarvis Realty, owned and run by Woody Jarvis. \"I'm real old school,\" he says. Jarvis, too, regularly uses a typewriter for office work. He gives the example of putting together an offer of purchase for a client. It'll start on the computer but he'll then print the document out and, should he need to make any modifications, he prefers to use correction fluid and his typewriter rather than re-printing the contract and wasting a lot of paper. \"Our contracts are very legible and easy to understand,\" he says. He'll also occasionally type up a name and address on an envelope for a colleague. \"For me, it works because I know how to make it all work.\"\n\nIn the 21st Century, typewriters have remained popular in certain corners of the world, despite the rise of computers. In India, for example, typewriters have found a flourishing market among enthusiasts and are still a common – albeit steadily vanishing – sight in courts and government offices.\n\nErnesto Roman Marr says he tries his best to keep these well-used and well-loved machines going for their owners (Credit: Ernesto Roman)\n\nJarvis's cousin, Lisa Floading, who works at the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design, is a big fan of typewriters. She has 62 of them. \"There's something very inviting about a typewriter waiting with paper in it,\" she explains. \"I have them all over my house.\"\n\nFloading uses a typewriter every day, she says, to make lists or write letters, and for office admin. \"There it is, you wrote three pages, boom, done. That's kind of lost on the laptop,\" she says. And she'll even bring a typewriter to her local coffee shop sometimes so she can work on it there. People regularly come up to her to ask about it, she says.\n\nIn June, Floading took part in an event in Milwaukee called Qwertyfest – intended to celebrate both the typewriter and the Qwerty keyboard layout, in memory of Christopher Latham Sholes. Among the attractions was a room full of typewriters where attendees could simply sit down and type. The sound of clacking keys and carriages returning filled the space. It was once a sound common in typing pools in businesses around the country.\n\nErnesto Roman The law firm run by John Tomasso and his brother is one of many businesses in the US that still rely on typewriters every day (Credit: Ernesto Roman)\n\nJim Riegert, now in his 70s, remembers what it used to be like. \"Back then, typewriters were pretty big. Typewriters and adding machines,\" he says, referring to desktop calculators. \"It got really difficult in the typewriter business about 25 years ago,\" he says. \"The internet was coming on and killing us, too.\" He runs Typewriters.com and, despite a decline in sales in recent decades, he still shifts four or five electric IBM typewriters every week. \"I just sold 12 to a prison that's putting them in the library because they don't let prisoners use computers,\" he says. Funeral homes, some of which use typewriters to compile death certificates, are also regular clients.\n\nRiegert's business is based in the city of Tucker, Georgia. His own office, inside a giant warehouse, is crammed witharound 70 or 80 IBM electric typewriters – second-hand units, which he services and sells. The build quality is top notch, he stresses. A prime model could set you back $749 (£594). When they were brand new in 1984 they would sell for around $1,000, but even accounting for inflation they have retained a surprising amount of value in the digital age. \"They're still the best typewriters you can buy,\" he says. These days, demand might be low – but somehow business remains steady, and profitable.\n\nIBM, nowadays arguably better known for supercomputers such as Watson, sold its typewriter business to Lexmark in the early 1990s. However, an IBM spokesperson says on very rare occasions, \"some people do ask for old manuals or service documents for typewriters, which we can provide if they're in the archives\". Lexmark, meanwhile, sold its last typewriter in 2002 and no longer has any typewriter-related services, though some of its former distributors still carry out maintenance on IBM Lexmark typewriters.\n\nErnesto Roman Despite being largely replaced by computers, typewriters are still more than just a collectors' item (Credit: Ernesto Roman)\n\nIf, on the other hand, you want to buy a brand-new typewriter, that too remains possible. Many thousands are still manufactured every year. Todd Althoff is president of Royal, a US company that has been making typewriters since 1904. \"We're going to continue,\" he insists. \"Obviously [there is] not that much growth but it's sustainable and we keep the factory busy.\"\n\nThe factory is in Indonesia, he explains, and is run by a team from Nakajima, a typewriter manufacturing firm from Japan. Every year, Royal still sells around 20,000 new electric typewriters and more than double that amount of mechanical typewriters. The latter have become desirable partly as decoration – a librarian might buy one for a display at the front of their library, for instance, suggests Althoff. The mechanical and electric models Royal sells cost between $300 (£238) and $400 (£317).\n\nThankfully, there are still companies that make new typewriter ribbons, notes Paul Lundy, who runs Bremerton Office Machine Company, a typewriter repair business in Seattle. \"Those accessories are readily available,\" he says. \"As a person who repairs typewriters, that's always running at the back of my mind – why are businesses still using these things?\"\n\nBut he has some good examples, including workers in warehouses who must continually process the transfer of goods by filling out forms. It's hard to feed these complex forms into a computer printer so that information gets printed onto them in exactly the right places. So, says Lundy, the warehouse workers prefer to insert the form into a typewriter and type it up by sight instead.\n\nGrant Hindsley Paul Lundy is finding that some of the typewriters he maintains for his customers are now starting to show their age (Credit: Grant Hindsley)\n\nOver the years, he's noticed that some aging typewriter parts are becoming more fragile, in some cases possibly as a result of plastic fatigue. But overall, they remain \"incredibly durable\" machines, he says.\n\nAnd, best of all, when you sit down to use one, there are no distractions. You just type. One of Lundy's customers who appreciates this perhaps more than most is Anjali Banerjee, a novelist who lives in Seattle. She has published 15 books and she wrote the first drafts of the last three on a typewriter.\n\nSome years ago, Banerjee began getting increasingly frustrated when trying to type new material on her computer. Notifications kept popping up or her word processing software would repeatedly intervene on things like spelling and grammar. So she went out and bought a typewriter.\n\nBanerjee started with an electric model but then got interested in mechanical versions. Now, she claims that her first drafts emerge more fluidly when she sits down at a typewriter rather than a screen. \"I have to keep moving forward. The story moves faster, if that makes sense,\" she says. \"You have to put it out there, like clay.\" The further editing – or shaping of the clay – takes place after she scans the typewriter-produced drafts into her computer.\n\nBanerjee goes on to admit candidly: \"I developed what we call 'typewriter fever'.\"\n\nGrant Hindsley Keeping these ageing pieces of equipment going requires a great deal of attention (Credit: Grant Hindsley)\n\nFollowing her first typewriter purchase in 2019, she built up an astonishing collection of no fewer than 120 machines. However, she has recently slimmed this down to about 80 typewriters and plans to sell off roughly half of those. In essence, it became an epic search to find her perfect typewriter. And Banerjee has definitely discovered some personal favourites, such as her Olivetti Studio 45, an Italian-made model. The author, who also plays piano, compares typing on a typewriter to playing a tune on the instrument. It's percussive. And it requires more effort from your hands and fingers than a computer keyboard. She has sought out typewriters that are just right – not too stiff, not too loose. But a good, deep \"throw\" (the depth of key press required) is satisfying, she adds.\n\nTypewriters engage the senses, says Banerjee. You hear the energetic clack-clack-clack of the keys as you work away. You might even detect the musty aroma of old offices or maybe long-faded cigarettes. In that atmosphere of industry distilled, you focus in on what you're doing. \"I lose time,\" she says. She'll look up and two hours may have gone by. Her thoughts are right there on the pages in front of her.\n\nLisa Floading Lisa Floading uses her collection of typewriters every day to write letters, compile lists and do admin (Credit: Lisa Floading)\n\nAs long as there are writers like Banerjee, and office workers who prize well-practised convenience over modernity, typewriters will never be completely obsolete, it seems.\n\nThat ought to keep Mike Marr busy, at his shop in Rhode Island. \"I was born and bred to repair typewriters and office equipment,\" he says. \"It's all I know in life.\"\n\nMany of the ailing machines that customers bring to him are fundamentally in good condition, merely requiring a clean and a re-oiling of their moving parts. A smattering of decades-old grease in the machine's tightest nooks and crannies has simply dried up. But that's an easy fix. The typewriter itself is perfectly fine – and it has plenty more work to do.\n\n--\n\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.",

A new exhibition explores this close friendship, and how it benefited art history.\n\nOn 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin.\n\nA rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. \"Roulin… has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,\" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Van Gogh's Postman Joseph Roulin, 1888 – Roulin was a close friend and loyal ally of the artist (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nPaying homage to this touching relationship is the exhibition Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits, opening at the MFA Boston, USA, on 30 March, before moving on to its co-organiser, the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in October. This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.\n\nRoulin wasn't just a model for Van Gogh – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship – Katie Hanson\n\n\"So much of what I was hoping for with this exhibition is a human story,\" co-curator Katie Hanson (MFA Boston) tells the BBC. \"The exhibition really highlights that Roulin isn't just a model for him – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship.\" Van Gogh's tumultuous relationship with Gauguin, and the fallout between them that most likely precipitated the ear incident, has tended to overshadow his narrative, but Roulin offered something more constant and uncomplicated. We see this in the portraits – the open honesty with which he returns Van Gogh's stare, and the mutual respect and affection that radiate from the canvas.\n\nA new life in Arles\n\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in February 1888, believing the brighter light and intense colours would better his art, and that southerners were \"more artistic\" in appearance, and ideal subjects to paint. Hanson emphasises Van Gogh's \"openness to possibility\" at this time, and his feeling, still relatable today, of being a new face in town. \"We don't have to hit on our life's work on our first try; we might also be seeking and searching for our next direction, our next place,\" she says. And it's in this spirit that Van Gogh, a newcomer with \"a big heart\", welcomed new connections.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A pen, ink and chalk portrait of Roulin, 1888, is among the exhibits in the show Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nBefore moving into the yellow house next door, now known so well inside and out, Van Gogh rented a room above the Café de la Gare. The bar was frequented by Joseph Roulin, who lived on the same street and worked at the nearby railway station supervising the loading and unloading of post. Feeling that his strength lay in portrait painting, but struggling to find people to pose for him, Van Gogh was delighted when the characterful postman, who drank a sizeable portion of his earnings at the café, agreed to pose for him, asking only to be paid in food and drink.\n\nBetween August 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh made six portraits of Roulin, symbols of companionship and hope that contrast with the motifs of loneliness, despair and impending doom seen in some of his other works. In each, Roulin is dressed in his blue postal worker's uniform, embellished with gold buttons and braid, the word \"postes\" proudly displayed on his cap. Roulin's stubby nose and ruddy complexion, flushed with years of drinking, made him a fascinating muse for the painter, who described him as \"a more interesting man than many people\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Portrait of Joseph Roulin, 1889 – Van Gogh's paintings of the Roulin family were full of warmth and optimism (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin was just 12 years older than Van Gogh, but he became a guiding light and father figure to the lonely painter – on account of Roulin's generous beard and apparent wisdom, Van Gogh nicknamed him Socrates. Born into a wealthy family, Van Gogh belonged to a very different social class from Roulin, but was taken with his \"strong peasant nature\" and forbearance when times were hard. Roulin was a proud and garrulous republican, and when Van Gogh saw him singing La Marseillaise, he noticed how painterly he was, \"like something out of Delacroix, out of Daumier\". He saw in him the spirit of the working man, describing his voice as possessing \"a distant echo of the clarion of revolutionary France\".\n\nThe friendship soon opened the door to four further sitters: Roulin's wife, Augustine, and their three children. We meet their 17-year-old son Armand, an apprentice blacksmith wearing the traces of his first facial hair, and appearing uneasy with the painter's attention; his younger brother, 11-year-old schoolboy Camille, described in the exhibition catalogue as \"squirming in his chair\"; and Marcelle, the couple's chubby-cheeked baby, who, Roulin writes, \"makes the whole house happy\". Each painting represents a different stage of life, and each sitter was gifted their portrait. In total, Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the Roulins, a significant output for one family, rarely seen in art history.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Roulin's wife is portrayed in Lullaby: Madame Augustine Rocking a Cradle (La Berceuse) 1889 (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nVan Gogh had once hoped to be a father and husband himself, and his relationship with the Roulin family let him experience some of that joy. In a letter to Theo, he described Roulin playing with baby Marcelle: \"It was touching to see him with his children on the last day, above all with the very little one when he made her laugh and bounce on his knees and sang for her.\" Outside these walls, Van Gogh often experienced hostility from the locals, who described him as \"the redheaded madman\", and even petitioned for his confinement. By contrast, the Roulins accepted his mental illness, and their home offered a place of safety and understanding.\n\nThe relationship, however, was far from one-sided. This educated visitor with his unusual Dutch accent was unlike anyone Roulin had ever met, and offered \"a different kind of interaction\", explains Hanson. \"He's new in town, new to Roulin's stories and he's going to have new stories to tell.\" Roulin enjoys offering advice – on furnishing the yellow house for example – and when, in the summer of 1888, Madame Roulin returned to her home town to deliver Marcelle, Roulin, left alone, found Van Gogh welcome company.\n\nVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston The Baby Marcelle Roulin and Armand Roulin, both 1888 – Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the family (Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin also got the rare opportunity to have portraits painted for free, and when, the following year, he was away for work in Marseille, it comforted him that baby Marcelle could still see his portrait hanging above her cradle. His fondness for Van Gogh shines through their correspondence. \"Continue to take good care of yourself, follow the advice of your good Doctor and you will see your complete recovery to the satisfaction of your relatives and your friends,\" he wrote to him from Marseille, signing off: \"Marcelle sends you a big kiss.\"\n\nVan Gogh lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies\n\nVan Gogh's portraits placed him in the heart of the family home. In his five versions of La Berceuse, meaning both \"lullaby\" and \"the woman who rocks the cradle\", Mme Roulin held a string device, fashioned by Van Gogh, that rocked the baby's cradle beyond the canvas, permitting the pair the peace to complete the artwork. The joyful background colours – green, blue, yellow or red – vary from one family member to another. Exuberant floral backdrops, reserved for the parents, come later, conveying happiness and affection – a blooming that took place since the earlier, plainer portraits.\n\nArt history has also greatly benefitted from the freedom this relationship granted Van Gogh to experiment with portraiture, and to develop his own style with its delineated shapes, bold, glowing colours, and thick wavy strokes that make the forms vibrate with life. In the security of this friendship, he overturned the conventions of portrait painting, prioritising an emotional response to his subject, resolving \"not to render what I have before my eyes\" but to \"express myself forcefully\", and to paint Roulin, he told Theo, \"as I feel him\".\n\nCredit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A photograph of Joseph Roulin in 1902, 12 years after the death of his friend Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nHad Van Gogh not felt Roulin's unwavering support, he may not have survived the series of devastating breakdowns that began in December 1888 when he took a razor to his ear. With the care of those close to him, he lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies.\n\nLike the intimate portraits he created in Arles, the exhibition courses with optimism. \"I hope being with these works of art and exploring his creative process – and his ways of creating connection – will be a heartwarming story,\" Hanson says. Far from \"shying away from the sadness\" of this period of Van Gogh's life, she says, the exhibition bears witness to the power of supportive relationships and \"the reality that sadness and hope can coexist\".\n\nVan Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits is at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 30 March to 7 September 2025, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam from 3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "How a computer that 'drunk dials' videos is exposing YouTube's secrets\n\n20 February 2025 Share Save Thomas Germain @thomasgermain Share Save\n\nEstudio Santa Rita\n\nYouTube is about to turn 20. An unusual research method is unveiling statistics about the platform that Google would rather keep hidden.\n\nYouTube may not seem secretive. It's public facing. You can watch an endless stream of content from now until your dying breath. There's been a mountain of research about the platform, unpacking everything from the commodified economy that surrounds it to the radicalising effects of its algorithm. But the picture goes blurry when you start asking simple questions. For example: how much YouTube do we all watch?\n\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, is quiet about that and many other details. In February, the company revealed that people who access YouTube on their TVs collectively watch one billion hours a day, but total numbers for the platform are an enigma. Estimates say YouTube has around 2.5 billion monthly users – almost one in three people on Earth – and the average mobile app user watches something like 29 hours a month. With that, let's try some back-of-the-napkin maths.\n\nIf we make a few assumptions, and say that monthly viewing average for app users can be applied across all YouTube users on both the website and television, we can multiply 2.5 billion by 29 hours. This would tell us that humanity consumes something like 8.3 million years of videos on YouTube every month. Over 12 months, that adds up to almost 100 million years, hundreds of times longer than the sum total of human history.\n\nHow many YouTube videos are there? What are they about? What languages do YouTubers speak? As of 14 February 2025, the platform's will have been running for 20 years. That is a lot of video. Yet we have no idea just how many there really are. Google knows the answers. It just won't tell you.\n\nExperts say that's a problem. For all practical purposes, one of the most powerful communication systems ever created – a tool that provides a third of the world's population with information and ideas – is operating in the dark.\n\nIn part that's because there's no easy way to get a random sampling of videos, according to Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the US. You can pick your videos manually or go with the algorithm's recommendations, but an unbiased selection that's worthy of real study is hard to come by. A few years ago, however, Zuckerman and his team of researchers came up with a solution: they designed a computer program that pulls up YouTube videos at random, trying billions of URLs at a time.\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts at Amherst/ BBC Curious how many YouTube videos there are? For now, the best answer you'll get is estimates from outside researchers (Credit: University of Massachusetts at Amherst/ BBC)\n\nYou might call the tool a bot, but that's probably over selling it, Zuckerman says. \"A more technically accurate term would be 'scraper',\" he says. The scraper's findings are giving us a first-time perspective on what's actually happening on YouTube.\n\nIn its 20 years of operation, YouTube has shaped entire generations' sensibilities and redefined global culture. Surveys show YouTube is the most popular social media site in the US by far, with 83% of adults and 93% of teenagers among its patrons. It's the second-most-visited website on Earth by most estimates, topped only by Google.com itself. But as the platform enters its third decade, the most basic facts about YouTube are still a closely guarded secret.\n\nA Google spokesperson shared a blogpost about the platform's recommendation algorithm, but declined to comment on the statistics and other issues mentioned in this story. For now, YouTube's mysteries continue.\n\nUnusual methods\n\n\"It's extremely difficult to get a grasp on what's going on inside social media platforms, because while the companies that operate them do make certain public disclosures, those disclosures are fragmentary and often somewhat misleading,\" says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"I think there's an instinct at Google that it's not in their interest to emphasise just how gargantuan YouTube is, how titanic the number of users, how phenomenal the amount of content. Google doesn't want to be seen as influential as it really is.\"\n\nBut Zuckerman and his colleagues found a way to peek behind the curtain. YouTube URL's have a standard format. With a few exceptions, the addresses begin with \"youtube.com/watch?v=\" and end with a unique string of 11 characters. Gangnam Style's identifier is 9bZkp7q19f0, for example.\n\nSo, the researchers wrote a program that basically generates 11 random characters and checks if there's a corresponding video. When the scraper finds one, it downloads it. Zuckerman says you can think of it like a pesky teenager, punching in random numbers for prank calls after dipping into his parent's liquor cabinet.\n\nEstudio Santa Rita On YouTube's 20th birthday, many basic facts about the platform are still shrouded in mystery (Credit: Estudio Santa Rita)\n\n\"If I wanted to know how many valid phone numbers there are in New York's 212 area code, I could just dial 212 and seven random numbers to see if somebody answers. I'd probably get cursed out a lot if I did it enough, but eventually I'd gather enough data to figure it out,\" Zuckerman says. \"That's what we did with YouTube. The thing is, YouTube has 18.6 quintillion potential numbers, so you have to dial a few billion before someone picks up.\"\n\nSo, Zuckerman's lab let the scraper drunk dial YouTube, over and over again, until it put together a big enough data set. To collect the first 10,016 videos they gathered for their initial study, the scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs. It took almost 1.87 billion bad guesses for every real video it found. If you did that work yourself, spending three seconds on each try, it would take an average of 178 years before you landed on a single video.\n\nWhen the researchers analysed their findings, the results challenged the prevailing narrative about what YouTube actually is.\n\nSecret stats\n\nThe first question was simple. How many videos have people uploaded to YouTube? Google used to release that statistic in the early days, back when YouTube had something to prove. When Google first acquired the platform in 2006, around 65,000 videos were uploaded every day. More recently the company says more than 500 hours are uploaded per minute, but it's tight-lipped about the number of videos.\n\nZuckerman and his colleagues compared the number of videos they found to the number of guesses it took, and arrived an estimate: in 2022, they calculated that YouTube housed more than nine billion videos. By mid 2024, that number had grown to 14.8 billion videos, a 60% jump.\n\nFor many, YouTube brings to mind the faces of bright-eyed influencers vying for money and fame, or professional content creators like MrBeast or Joe Rogan. But the researchers then took a subset of the videos and had human reviewers watch each one to answer a series of questions about what they saw. For the most part, they didn't find the work of professionals.\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts at Amherst/ Yun Sun Park/ BBC The majority of YouTube videos get less than 500 views. 4% have never been seen a single time (Credit: University of Massachusetts at Amherst/ Yun Sun Park/ BBC)\n\nOnly 0.21% of the videos they analysed featured any kind of monetisation, such as a sponsorship or an advertisement in the video itself. Less than 4% of the videos included a call to action like YouTube's famous invitations to like, comment and subscribe.\n\nThose with some kind of set or background design accounted for 14% of videos, while only 38% had undergone any form of editing. More than half of the videos had \"noticeably shaky\" camera work. Only around 18% of videos we're judged to have high quality sound, and the sound quality varied significantly almost 85% of the time. More than 40% had just music, and no speech. About 16% of videos in the sample were primarily still images.\n\nThe top YouTubers attract audiences in the hundreds of millions, but the researchers estimated the median number of views for a YouTube videos is just 41, and 4% of videos haven't been watched a single time. About 74% of videos have zero comments. Around 89% have no likes. Typical YouTube videos aren't just getting little attention it seems, they're also very short. They assessed that the median YouTube video is only 64 seconds long, and more than a third of videos are less than 33 seconds long.\n\nTroubling questions\n\nYouTube once sold itself as a tool for regular people. The company's early slogan was \"broadcast yourself\". But today, YouTube suggests it's more of a service for people to watch the work of professional creators. In his annual letter at the start of 2025, YouTube's chief executive Neal Mohan said the company's mission is still to \"give everyone a voice\" – but most of the message was a discussion about how \"YouTubers are becoming the start-ups of Hollywood\" and \"YouTube is the new television\".\n\nThis narrative misses a critical piece of the picture, says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in Zuckerman's lab, who participated in the scraping project. YouTube is a free service that was built from the ground up by a private company, and it could be argued that Google should be able to run the platform as such. But when you examine how people are actually using YouTube, it looks less like TV and more like infrastructure, McGrady says.\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts at Amherst/ Yun Sun Park/ BBC English is the most common language on YouTube, but it accounts for less than 30% of video (Credit: University of Massachusetts at Amherst/ Yun Sun Park/ BBC)\n\n(To identify languages, the researchers used speech recognition software called Whisper. It paints a fairly accurate picture, but makes occasional errors. For example, Whisper sometimes identifies unintelligible sounds as Nynorsk, a written-only language in Norway.)\n\n\"Most of us imagine YouTube as this place where millionaires give away prizes in a Squid-Game-style contest,\" he says. \"But when you want to have a conversation about YouTube and its place in our society, we need to look at the ways it's used, not just the ways it's consumed.\"\n\nYouTube is one of the internet's de facto repositories, the first place many of us go when we have videos we want to post or store online. It's also a place where local authority meetings are broadcast, for example, providing a vital opportunity for public accountability in ways that weren't possible before it existed. It isn't just a \"platform\", McGrady says, it's a critical piece of infrastructure, and that's how it should be regulated. \"For companies that own so much of our public sphere, there are some minimum expectations we should have about transparency.\"\n\nGoogle is dealing with more regulatory pressure than ever before. The company has faced multiple cases across the globe accusing it of running illegal monopolies in several industries. Google has lost several of them, and is currently fighting a number of other antitrust lawsuits.\n\nBut YouTube has escaped much of the scrutiny that's challenged its biggest social media competitors, according to Barrett of New York University. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk make frequent, loud pronouncements about how they do business and what's happening on their platforms. \"Google, in contrast, has largely stayed out of the crossfire by choosing a strategy of being much quieter, a strategy I'd say has largely worked for them,\" he says.\n\n\"Social media is an anomaly when it comes to how little companies need to explain themselves if you compare it to other industries like finance, or agriculture or even broadcasting,\" Barrett says. \"But social media companies are fundamental players not just in mass communication but in all matters of political and civic life.\"\n\nThe most important thing to understand is the inner workings of YouTube's algorithm, a system that has astronomical power over the distribution of information all over the world, Barrett says. But simple details about what happens on the platform are important as well. \"It would be very valuable to know all of the facts that are currently so shrouded and unavailable. They are the building blocks of doing deeper research,\" he says. \"It only takes you so far, but you've got to start someplace. The more basic information we have to assess, the healthier the public debate about the role of social media in society will be.\"\n\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

        "content": "The art curator saving the world's rarest fruit\n\n12 March 2025 Share Save Lucy Lovell Share Save\n\nLucy Lovell (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nFormer Tate Modern director Vicente Todolí founded Todolí Citrus Fundació to preserve rare citrus varieties and compile a catalogue of farming knowledge to inspire future generations.\n\nOur preconceptions of lemons are very rarely challenged. But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todolí is showing me the secret side of citrus – and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\n\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\n\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todolí warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todolí is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\n\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at Todolí Citrus Fundació, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todolí's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\n\nLucy Lovell Todolí Citrus Fundació is home to more than 500 varieties of citrus (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nNow, Todolí considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todolí Citrus Fundació came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todolí did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\n\nAround the same time, Todolí was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adrià, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todolí asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adrià replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nTodolí was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todolí Citrus Fundació is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todolí is blessed with buckets of it.\n\nLucy Lovell Vicente Todolí was inspired by history's most illustrious citrus gardens (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todolí explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\n\nPlan your trip: Tours cost €15 for adults and €10 for children up to 15 and are available from around November to April (depending on when the fruit matures). Book at todolicitrusfundacio.org. The closest airport is Valencia Airport; it takes around an hour to drive from Valencia city centre to Todolí Citrus Fundació.\n\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todolí.\n\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todolí Citrus Fundació seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\n\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todolí Citrus Fundació, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todolí cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Tours include an exploratory walk and a tasting of seasonal citrus fruits (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nAs well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual Poecítrics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.\n\nBack on the tour, and Todolí's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\n\nPeople think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago – Vicente Todolí\n\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todolí's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\n\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,\" Miara says. \"Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Buddha's Hand is named for its resemblance to the fingers shown on many Buddha representations (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nMiara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. \"We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,\" Miara says. \"It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.\"\n\nAfter flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon – not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.\n\nFor Todolí, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. \"For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,\" he says. \"People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago, that it's one of the oldest fruits in the world. It has been so important in literature, poetry and art.\"\n\nTodolí can see the art of citrus – and from his otherworldly orchard, he's helping the rest of the world to see it too.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "What your fingernails can reveal about your health\n\n10 February 2025 Share Save Jasmin Fox-Skelly Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nFingernails help protect the underlying skin from injury, and they also come in handy when you want to scratch an itch or peel a satsuma. But what do they reveal about your health?\n\nThere's no shortage of folk wisdom about how to glean the state of your overall health from your nails, such as the pervasive idea that the white flecks that sometimes turn up – known as leukonychia – are a sign of calcium deficiency. But is there any truth to these ideas?\n\nFirst up some basic anatomy. Nails are an extension of the skin. They are made from keratin, a super tough protein that shields the toes and tops of your fingers from trauma. The half-moon shape seen at the base of the nail is the lunula, which serves as the \"growth centre\" for the nail, producing the cells that will eventually harden into the nail plate . It sits above the cuticle, a layer of dead cells joining the base of the nailbed to the skin. The cuticle offers extra protection by acting as the nail's security guard, stopping bacteria, fungi and other pathogens in their tracks.\n\nWhile the eyes might be the windows to the soul, to a doctor the nails can be the windows to your health. Physicians can use them to diagnose all sorts of conditions, from dermatological problems to kidney disease or even autoimmune disorders.\n\nA sign of something serious\n\n\"One of the first things I learned in medical school was to look for something called clubbing, where there is this loss of the angle between the nail and the nail bed itself,\" says Dan Baumgardt, a general practitioner in medicine and lecturer in neuroscience and physiology at the University of Bristol.\n\nWith clubbing, the nail beds soften, and the nails almost seem to \"float\" instead of being firmly attached to the finger. The fingertips also appear large or bulging. \"It causes an unusual sort of swollen finger appearance where the finger looks a little bit like a drumstick,\" says Baumgardt.\n\nClubbing is a sign of extremely low blood oxygen levels. It is most commonly associated with lung cancer, but it can also indicate an infection of the lining of the heart chambers and heart valves, among other things. Other conditions where it is observed include celiac disease, cirrhosis of the liver and lung infections amongst others.\n\nAlamy Clubbed nails are shaped like an upside down spoon, and can be an indicator of a serious underlying condition such as lung cancer (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"If you do see a patient with clubbing the rule of thumb is to get them an x-ray as an urgency, because it could be an underlying lung cancer that could be explaining it,\" says Baumgardt. \"Having said that even though it's one of the first things that we learned in medical school. I really don't know why, because in all the 14 years I've been a doctor, I've only ever seen it once,\" he says.\n\nWhite flecks on the nail – known as leukonychia – are often touted to be a sign of vitamin or mineral deficiencies. However, the evidence to support this is mixed. In one small study of undergraduates, there was no correlation between this symptom and a person's intake of either zinc or calcium. However, in one case report of a patient with Crohn's disease who developed severe leukonychia on his fingernails while deficient in selenium, it disappeared after treatment with this mineral.\n\nIn general, leukonychia are more likely to be a result of nail trauma. Stubbing your toe, trapping your fingernail in a door, too many manicures, or dropping a heavy object on your foot may cause such a mark.\n\nNevertheless, white discolouration on the nail could suggest an underlying health issue. For instance, white marks can be a sign of heavy metal poisoning with lead or arsenic. White discolouration of the nail could be a sign of psoriasis, a chronic skin condition that causes raised, inflamed, scaly patches of skin. If the entire nail turns white, this could suggest a deficiency of protein in the bloodstream, which can indicate kidney disease, liver disease or diabetes.\n\n\"If people have low protein levels in their bloodstream it [often] causes the whole nail to go white,\" says Baumgardt. \"We tend to associate that with people who've got liver disease, so things like cirrhosis of the liver, perhaps as a result of alcoholism.\"\n\nBlue nails, on the other hand, are a sign that the body might be lacking oxygen. It could be a sign of serious heart disease or emphysema and is something you should get checked out by a doctor as soon as possible. This is also the case if you see dark lines underneath the nail, as although this can be caused by trauma, it could also be a sign of subungual melanoma, a rare but serious type of skin cancer.\n\nBleeding beneath the nail – if it doesn't heal – could also indicate something more serious. \"You can get what we call splinter haemorrhages, which look like little red streaks of blood, similar to if you imagine a splinter stuck under your nail,\" says Baumgardt. \"That haemorrhage can sometimes be suggestive of vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. One of the main underlying causes can be an infection of the heart valve, which causes these odd little red swellings,\" he says.\n\nGetty Images There are many possible causes for leukonychia, including superficial damage from bashing – though it can also be a sign of something more sinister (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nA touch of fungus\n\nOther, more common conditions can also be diagnosed by looking at the nails. When examining a patient, doctors typically look for alterations in colour, thickness and shape.\n\nFor example, in a healthy nail the underlying nail bed should be pink except for the white tips. Other colours could indicate an infection of the nail itself, or an underlying health condition.\n\nNails are extensions of the skin, effectively, and your skin can tell you so much about what's going on in your body – Dan Baumgardt\n\n\"If you see either white or yellow discolouration on your toes, especially on your toenails, that is a sign of a fungal infection,\" says Holly Wilkinson, a lecturer in wound healing at the University of Hull.\n\nAlthough in many countries, such as the US and the UK, you can buy over-the-counter topical medication for mild fungal nail infections, if you leave it too late then it can become more difficult to treat. (It's important to always consult a doctor if you suspect that you have a nail infection.)\n\n\"I think a lot of the time when people have discolouration in the nails they don't realise that it's an infection, so it can get to a point where it becomes quite bad, and then they have to go and see a podiatrist,\" says Wilkinson.\n\nFragile nails\n\nMeanwhile the shape of the nail can also reveal underlying problems. Healthy toe and fingernails should be convex, which means they curve slightly outwards. They shouldn't contain any dips or craters. If they do, it may be a sign that you have koilonychia, a condition where the nail curves inwards and looks thin and brittle. In some cases, people with koilonychia have a central depression in their nail deep enough to hold a drop of fluid, hence the condition is often referred to as \"spoon nails\".\n\nIf your any of your nails bear a resemblance to a spoon, this could be a sign of anaemia, when the body doesn't have enough healthy blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues. Anaemia can be caused by iron deficiency. However, it can also be a sign of coeliac disease, among other conditions.\n\nOn the other hand, some changes in the nail can indicate nutritional deficiencies. Some people have horizontal ridges, known as Beau's lines, that run horizontally across their nails. This could indicate a deficiency such as insufficient protein. However, this feature could also be a sign of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease – a disorder involving reduced circulation of blood to certain parts of the body, usually due to the buildup of fat and cholesterol in the arteries – so it is still important to get it checked out.\n\n\"Beau's lines can indicate zinc deficiency, while brittle nails are a sign of hypothyroidism or vitamin B7 deficiency,\" says Mary Pearson, a paediatrician working at the University Hospital of Wales. \"In some cases we might be more diligent about looking for these, for example in safeguarding cases where we are concerned about a child's nutrition, or where we suspect chronic disease,\" she says.\n\nIn other cases, nail changes may be caused by lifestyle factors rather than health problems. For example peeling nails, also known as onychoschizia, occurs when thin layers of the nails literally separate from the free nail edge and peel back. \"Onychoschizia may be the result of excessive hand washing, nail dryness, and the use of acrylics and other nail polishes,\" says Joshua Zeichner, professor of dermatology at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.\n\nGetty Images Fungal nail infections can take up to a year to treat successfully (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nYou may wonder what it is about nails that makes them so revealing of a person's underlying health. One of the main reasons is that nails are obviously one of the few parts of the body that you can see from the outside.\n\n\"Nails are extensions of the skin, effectively, and your skin can tell you so much about what's going on in your body,\" says Baumgardt. \"Your first impression of a patient often starts from the bedside, so you look them all over and you start off with their nails, you look in their eyes and their mouth. And you start to do an end-of-the-bed assessment, trying to pick out diagnostic pictures from that point early on. So nails are one of the first things we see,\" he says.\n\nWhile most of the time changes in the nail are harmless, and are simply down to a nail injury, if you notice that the change in shape, colour, or texture is more permanent, then you should always consult the advice of a doctor.\n\n* All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

        "content": "How often should you poo?\n\n26 February 2025 Share Save Jasmin Fox-Skelly Share Save\n\nEmmanuel Lafont/ BBC\n\nThe ideal poo is a 'type 3' or 'type 4' – cracked or smooth sausage – delivered once per day.\n\nAre you a three-times a day kind of person, or is a trip to the lavatory a more rare and special occasion? And crucially, what does your poo frequency reveal about your health? Sit down, relax, and learn about the science of poop.\n\nHow often we go for a number two can vary from person to person. Every time we eat, the large intestine contracts and pushes food along the digestive tract. This automatic \"gastro-colic reflex\" results in a the release of hormones that create the urge to poo, otherwise known as a \"call to stool\". Most of us have learnt to suppress this urge, however, meaning that once a day or less has become the new norm.\n\n\"We all tend to be too busy to poo,\" says Martin Veysey, a gastroenterologist and general medicine physician based at Canberra Hospital in Australia.\n\nConventionally, it has often been claimed that one poo a day is a sign of good gut health. But in the past it wasn't known what constitutes 'normal' when it comes to bowel movements. One study even implied that anything from one bowel action every few weeks or months to 24 poos a day could be regarded as normal.\n\nHowever, thanks to the pioneering work of scientists like Ken Heaton, a consultant physician at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the UK, we now known better. In the late 1980s, Keaton and colleagues surveyed residents of East Bristol, asking them the rather impertinent question – how often do you poo?\n\nThe results revealed a huge variety in bowel movements. Although the most common bowel habit was one poo per day, only 40% of men and 33% of women adhered to this practice. Some defecated less than once a week, others three times a day. Overall, the study concluded that \"conventionally normal bowel function is enjoyed by less than half the population and that, in this aspect of human physiology, younger women are especially disadvantaged\".\n\nPeople who pooed four soft stools a week were 1.78 times more likely to die within five years than those who pooed normal stools seven times a week\n\nIncidentally this wasn't the only contribution Heaton made to the science of stools. He later helped devise The Bristol Stool Form Scale, which, with its accompanying illustrations, has become a widely used practical guide to help doctors diagnose digestive problems. The scale features handy descriptions of stools varying from \"separate hard lumps, like nuts\" to \"fluffy pieces with ragged edges\".\n\nThe \"goldilocks/ goldiplops\" zone\n\nThe NHS and other health bodies state that having a bowel movement between three times a day and three times a week is considered normal. But normal and healthy aren't necessarily the same thing. Scientists might have solved the mystery of how often we poo, but it does nothing to answer the question how often should we poo? Increasingly, researchers are finding that a person's bowel movements are a strong indicator of their health.\n\nFor example, a 2023 study examined the bowel habits of 14,573 adults in the United States. The most frequent bowel habit was seven times per week (50.7% of people), and the most common poo type was \"like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft\". Researchers then tracked the participants for over five years to see if there was any relationship between stool frequency and mortality. They found that people who pooed four soft stools a week were 1.78 times more likely to die within five years than those who pooed normal stools seven times a week. Infrequent defecators were also 2.42 and 2.27 more likely to die from cancer and cardiovascular disease, respectively.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont/ BBC Having a shorter 'gut transit time' – essentially, pooing more frequently – has been linked to a healthier microbiome (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)\n\nHow much is a good amount to poop is also a question occupying Sean Gibbons, a microbiologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, the US. In 2024, Gibbons led a study which categorised 1,400 healthy adults into four groups based on their toilet habits; constipated (one-two bowel movements per week); low-normal (three-six bowel movements per week); high-normal (one-three bowel movements per day); and diarrhoea. They then looked to see if there was any association between poo frequency and a person's gut microbiome.\n\nGibbons found that frequent pooers who squeezed out one to three stools a day had a higher proportion of 'good' bacteria residing in their guts than those who visited the lavatory less often. On the flip side of the coin, Gibbons found that people who pooed less than three times a week were more likely to have toxins in their blood that have previously been implicated in conditions such as chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer's.\n\n\"In the Goldilocks zone of pooing [the high-normal category], we saw a rise in strictly anaerobic microbes that produce chemicals called short chain fatty acids,\" says Gibbons. One of these short chained fatty acids (SFAs), butyrate, is known to lower inflammation in the body. This is important, because chronic inflammation is now thought to be the driving factor behind conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even Alzheimer's.\n\n\"Having higher levels of butyrate also allows you to control glucose levels in your blood better, so you have better insulin sensitivity,\" says Gibbons. \"Butyrate will also bind to cells in the gut, stimulating them to produce hormones that make you feel full,\" he says.\n\nGibbons believes one reason people who were constipated had higher levels of harmful toxins in their blood stream is that when a person has infrequent bowel movements, poo sticks around in their gut for long periods. This causes bacteria in the gut to eat up all of the available fibre, converting it into health-promoting SFAs. The problem, however, is that once all the fibre is gone, the bacteria start fermenting proteins instead – which releases harmful toxins into the bloodstream. These toxins are known to cause damage to organs including the kidneys and heart. One, known as phenylacetylglutamine, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, for example.\n\n\"If you have chronically high levels of this metabolite in your circulation, it can promote atherosclerosis, a kind of hardening of the arteries and damage to the cardiovascular system,\" says Gibbons.\n\nGibbons says that even though clinical guidance states that between three stools a day to three poos a week is healthy, his study showed that even in the low-normal stool group there was a rise in toxins in the bloodstream.\n\n\"It's hard to say definitively, because we don't have causal data to know whether these people went on to get sick in the future, but it does seem to be the case that, based on what we were looking at, pooping every other day to a couple of times a day is probably a better window to be healthy,\" says Gibbons.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont/ BBC Experts recommend keeping track of your poos, so you can detect any changes that you might need to discuss with a doctor (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)\n\nHowever, as ever, correlation is not causation. It is possible that people who are already less healthy in other ways might have less frequent bowel movements, although Gibbon's study tried to control for this by only selecting adults who had no reported health concerns.\n\nOne measure of the health of your gut is the time it takes for food to travel through your digestive system – known as gut transit time. You can easily test this at home by eating brightly-coloured foods such as sweetcorn, and then timing how long it takes to come out the other end. Generally speaking, the longer a person's gut transit time, the less often they poo, and the more likely they are to suffer constipation.\n\nMore like this:\n\nIn 2020, researchers at King's College London gave blue muffins to 863 people to measure their gut transit time. This was part of the Predict1 study – a clinical research project focused on understanding how individual variations in genetics, gut microbiome, and other factors influence how different meals affect blood sugar and fat levels in the body.\n\nThe study revealed that gut transit times varied widely from person to person, ranging from under 12 hours to many days. Remarkably, the microbes found in the guts of people with short transit times – who tended to defecate more often - differed remarkably from those with longer transit times, with a short transit time associated with a healthier gut microbiome.\n\n\"What we found was that people who had a longer transit time tended to have more 'bad' gut bacteria, so bacteria that have previously been linked to having worse heart health and metabolic health,\" says Emily Leeming, a microbiome scientist at King's College London.\n\nThis finding was most pronounced for people with a gut transit time of 58 hours or more, who tended to poo less than three times a week.\n\nLike Gibbons, Leeming suspects that in those whose poo spends longer in the gut, microbes aren't getting a fresh meal – so they end up switching from eating fibre and carbohydrates to proteins. This then produces byproducts which are bad for your health.\n\nAs well as a healthier gut microbiome, Leeming's study revealed that those with shorter gut transit times benefited from having less visceral fat – a type of fat that lies deep within the belly and surrounds abdominal organs. Visceral fat is dangerous because it can increase your risk of many health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Finally, people with short gut transit times also displayed healthier responses to food, known as a 'postprandial response'. This means they had lower levels of sugar and lipids in their blood following a meal, lowering their risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe finding fits with what scientists know about constipation, and its links to chronic disease. If someone is chronically constipated, then they may be at higher risk of things like bowel cancer. However, the evidence to support this is mixed – one meta-analysis, a type of study which combines the results from several others which answer the same question, found that bowel cancer was not more prevalent in constipated individuals.\n\nEmmanuel Lafont/ BBC Eating more fruits and vegetables can help people to poo more frequently (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)\n\n\"But we also seeing links with other parts of the body. For example, people with Parkinson's Disease can have constipation up to 20 years before they show any motor symptoms,\" says Leeming.\n\nVeysey, meanwhile, points to the known link between slow bowel transit and gallstones – hard deposits of bile that form in the gallbladder. \"It also raises the risk of developing polyps, pre-cancerous lesions in the bowel, which then can become cancers,\" he says.\n\nWhat your poo says about you\n\nRather than the number of bowel movements a week – which can vary from person to person, Leeming says that the key thing to look out for is any unexplained changes in bowel habits. She also advises that it's a good idea to keep track of your regular pooping habits to get to know what's normal for you.\n\n\"We should all be looking at our poo, because it's basically like a free gut health test,\" says Leeming. \"It's not just how often you go, it's also colour and the shape of your poo as well. What you're really looking for is type 3 to type 4 [on the Bristol Stool Form Scale], which is basically a sausage with cracks in it, or a smooth sausage.\"\n\nAs regards colour, if you see any black or red in your stools, that indicates the presence of blood. Although there could be a harmless explanation for this, it could be a sign of colorectal cancer and so it's important to see a doctor as soon as possible. You should also talk to your doctor if you regularly have diarrhoea or need to go very suddenly, or if you experience a lot of cramps, bloating, and gas after eating.\n\nFinally, if you'd like to become more \"regular\", there's three simple things you can do. \"In our study, the people in the Goldilocks zone ate more fruits and vegetables, were more hydrated, and were more physically active,\" says Gibbons.\n\n--\n\nFor trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.",

        "content": "Why your most attractive qualities can give your partner 'the ick'\n\n23 February 2025 Share Save William Park @williamhpark Share Save\n\nJavier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images)\n\nThe qualities that make us stand out the most, and the main reasons that people find us attractive, can be a blessing and a curse. Sometimes our most appealing traits can become a reason for a breakup.\n\n\"The ick\" was one of the more unusual words to be added to the Cambridge Dictionary in 2024. The phrase describes the feeling of suddenly seeing something about a partner in a new light, and finding it so unattractive it can't be unseen. Once you have the ick, it is unfortunately incurable.\n\nWhile the phrase might be intended in a lighthearted manner, it shows that there can be unattractive qualities about a partner that are not immediately obvious. In fact, we might have found those qualities really attractive earlier in the relationship. This is called \"fatal attraction\" – when a person comes to dislike aspects of a partner that they were initially attracted to. \"It doesn't mean fatal in the sense of deadly, but fatal as in the sense of prophetic,\" says Diane Felmlee, a social psychologist from Penn State University in the US.\n\n\"I like to think of it as having 'too much' of an attractive quality,\" she says. \"Disenchantment with a partner can occur even when people get what they want, and perhaps because they get what they want.\"\n\nDuring her own research, Felmlee asks people for reasons they were first attracted to a partner, why they became dissatisfied and why past relationships ended. Most people listed various needs that were not being met by their ex-partner as a cause for a breakup. But Felmlee noticed some of those missed needs were related to reasons they were attracted to an ex-partner in the first place.\n\n\"It is a different interpretation of the same quality,\" she says. \"It's a negative way of looking at a positive trait. I have an example here of someone who said they were attracted to their partner because she was considerate. And then they complained that she said 'sorry' too much. Well, that sounds pretty considerate.\"\n\nOther examples identified by Felmlee include being attracted to someone with a high-powered job, only to find that they spend too long at work, or finding a partner funny, but then complaining that they don't take life seriously. Easygoing, laid-back partners became flaky or never on time. \"Easygoing is great, as long as you're punctual,\" says Felmlee with a laugh.\n\nLikewise, partners who are at first judged to be powerful or strong become controlling or overbearing after a breakup. People who are nice become pushovers. Successful people become workaholics.\n\nDisenchantment with a partner can occur even when people get what they want, and perhaps because they get what they want – Diane Felmlee\n\nWith fatal attraction, the stronger the initial attraction to a particular characteristic, the more likely it is to become a reason for a breakup. Why might it be that big positives end up being dealbreakers?\n\nFirst, it could be that the things we first notice about new partners, or potential partners, are the extreme qualities that make them stand out. \"We don't describe partners as 'kind of helpful', or 'a little hard working',\" says Felmlee. \"And the more extreme it is, the more likely people are to dislike those qualities later.\"\n\nThere might be an element of naivety too, adds Felmlee – our initial infatuation temporarily blinds us to the potential downsides of a very extreme characteristic. But after the initial excitement subsides, we become more aware of how those characteristics might have a negative effect.\n\nThis reevaluation can happen subtly over time. Fatal attraction might be a slow, dawning realisation rather than a drastic reversal in judgment as with the ick. Couples that have been together for between 10 and 21 years have the lowest levels of relationship adjustment, meaning that they find it harder between these ages to resolve conflicts, adjust to new challenges or change their expectations towards their partner.\n\nJavier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images Someone who enjoys organising surprises can also become frustratingly difficult to plan anything with (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images)\n\nIt is important to reevaluate relationship satisfaction because it is a predictor for many aspects of life, according to Samantha Joel, a psychologist at Western University in Ontario, Canada. People in unhappy relationships have poorer physical health, higher blood pressure, are at higher risk of poor mental health and have worse work-life balance, among many other problems.\n\nA simple measure of relationship satisfaction, called social exchange theory, can be made by comparing the rewards we receive from being with a partner, such as how much fun we have, if they make us feel prized, their beauty or money, against the costs, such as conflicts, the potential to be hurt or financial investments. There are two ways that people use social exchange theory – firstly by comparing a current relationship to past ones. We will find a relationship less satisfying if it falls below the standard that we expect based on past experiences. The other comparison we might make is with other options available to us currently. We might reject potential partners, even if we think the signs may be promising, if we feel we might have better odds with other people.\n\nThose calculations will be different for everyone. Same-sex couples, for example, are likely to face higher relationship costs because of discrimination and homophobia. Depending on where you live, you might have fewer dating options available to you too.\n\nIt is probably a better bet to look for someone with similar extremes to us rather than average qualities – Diane Felmlee\n\nSo, are we better off being drawn to a middle-of-the-road partner with fewer extremes? \"I don't think so,\" says Felmlee. \"It is probably a better bet to look for someone with similar extremes to us rather than average qualities.\"\n\nCouples that are similar in some key traits are more likely to be successful. Looking at a pool of 79,000 British couples, the strongest indicator for relationship satisfaction is being a similar age. But other demographic factors, including education, and some other things like religious or political beliefs and substance use are also strong predictors for relationship success. There are also smaller but still significant correlations between biological factors like being a similar height and BMI.\n\n\"We found particularly high correlations for things like beliefs and values, educational attainment, and certainly substance use,\" says Tanya Horwitz, a doctoral student at the University of Colorado Boulder in the US. Similarity seems to be strengthening, but dissimilarity only seems to be a problem in certain circumstances. \"A smaller minority showed any sign of a negative correlation,\" she says. One example which did seem to matter was that morning people really don't seem to be compatible with evening people, and vice versa.\n\nJavier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images Despite the difficulties it can cause, fatal attraction doesn't necessarily mean the end of a relationship (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/ Getty Images)\n\nHorwitz says that two very different people might still find themselves attracted to each other initially, but they are less likely to be successful long-term. The couples in her study were older, cohabiting, married or co-parenting. \"These were generally people who are in quite serious or long-term relationships, and I think it really says more about what makes for a long-term union, than what makes for an initial attraction,\" she says.\n\nFelmlee caveats that fatal attraction doesn't have to be terminal for a relationship. Partners who share similarly strong characteristics might do OK. \"Studying fatal attraction, it's less common for people to complain about the similar qualities that they say they have in themselves,\" she says.\n\nOne of her interviewees, an older man, said he was first attracted to his wife because of the strength of her character and her confidence. The downside, he said, is that she could sometimes be stubborn. \"But they're still married,\" says Felmlee. \"So what's going on? He also showed an awareness of himself and admitted he could be stubborn too. That was really sweet.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The grannies who saved Albanian cuisine\n\n7 March 2025 Share Save Tristan Rutherford Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAfter being sealed off from the outside world for decades and experiencing a mass exodus, Albania is leaning into its culinary roots with the help of grandma chefs.\n\nTefta Pajenga, aged 76, is one of many pension-age TV chefs in Albania. In her nationally televised cooking show, the retired teacher instructs a younger housewife how to cook japrakë, a traditional platter of vine leaves stuffed with rice and herbs.\n\nJaprakë holds a special place in Albanian hearts. It's typically prepared by families together and then shared on Christian and Muslim feast days in this religiously diverse nation. Like so many dishes in this culinary crossroads, the recipe comes from elsewhere (the name derives from the Turkish word for \"leaf\", courtesy of Albania's more-than 500 years under Ottoman rule). Yet, the ingredients are all local: dill, peppers and mint from northern Albania.\n\nToday, Albanian grannies like Pajenga are teaching multiple generations in one of Europe's youngest-aged countries how to cook age-old dishes. That's because the Balkan nation has suffered not one, but two bouts of culinary amnesia over the past 80 years.\n\nAlamy Japrakë is a popular Albanian dish among both Christians and Muslims (Credit: Alamy)\n\nFirst, from 1946 to 1991, Albania was ruled by hardline communists who effectively sealed the small, mountainous nation off from the outside world, leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say it was once \"the North Korea of Europe\". During this period, cookbooks were burnt, imports were prohibited, foreign travel was banned, food was collectivised and shortages were widespread. It was a recipe for disaster.\n\nSecond, in the violent build-up and aftermath of communism's collapse in the 1990s, 710,000 citizens – 20% of the population – fled Albania from 1989 to 2001 in search of work in other countries. Over time, Pajenga said that many of these emigrants forgot their grandmothers' recipes as they adapted to new countries and cultures. Between the widespread food shortages during communism and the subsequent emigration after it, by the early 21st Century, many Albanians at home and abroad had forgotten how to prepare traditional Albanian cuisine – except for women of a certain age.\n\nIronically, Pajenga says that the Albania's transition to democracy compounded the problem. \"During communism, people had one fixed job from 07:00 until 15:00,\" she recalls. \"When democracy came, you needed more than one job to feed the family.\" Therefore, many of those who did recall how to prepare traditional Albanian dishes now no longer had the time to make them.\n\nAlamy Albania was once known as \"the North Korea of Europe\" (Credit: Alamy)\n\nSo, when Pajenga started her TV show in 2004, \"my audience was not for chefs but for housewives\" and also young people, \"who were lacking the knowledge or had forgotten how to make traditional cuisine\".\n\nAlbania's culinary culture has long reflected its status as a stepping stone between East and West. The Romans introduced grapes, olives and other modern Albanian staples when they took hold of the area in the 2nd Century BCE. Starting in the 16th Century, dishes like Arnavut ciğeri (Albanian liver) spread east from Albania across the Ottoman Empire, while sutlijaš (rice pudding) likely arrived in Albania courtesy of the Ottomans. And after World War Two, imported dishes like ajvar (a relish made from roasted red peppers, aubergine and spices) migrated south from the northern Balkans.\n\nSome indigenous foods, like mishavinë (a type of white, grainy cheese), cannot be found anywhere else. Its preparation method, in which curd is packed tightly for three months inside animal fat until it ferments into a piquant cheese, has been passed down by generations of transhumant herders in the Albanian Alps. Other age-old Albanian dishes include flia, a pancake with crepe-like layers brushed with cream, and byrek me mish, a Turkish-style borek laced with paprika.\n\nGjyste Bici, 67, learned centuries-old recipes at her grandmother's knee in Albania's northern Alps, where snowy winters can still cut off residents for months at a time. \"Even before communism there was little material published, so recipes were always passed from grandmothers to younger generations,\" she says.\n\nAlamy Flia is a typical and very popular Albanian dish (Credit: Alamy)\n\nMany Albanian recipes have a religious root. This was frowned upon under communism, especially after 1967, when authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha banned all religious practices.\n\n\"The dictatorship tried to destroy all religions,\" recalls Dallendyshe Xhahysa, a 91-year-old amateur chef who memorised Albanian recipes from her ancestors and made them through the country's near-half century of communist rule. According to Xhahysa, \"recipes used in Muslim and Christian celebrations never would have survived if it wasn't for the efforts of grandmothers like me\".\n\n\"We had to cook special dishes secretly during Easter or Ramadan,\" continues Xhahysa. One such dish was halva, a dense, fudge-like dessert traditionally shared on the holiest day of Ramadan, Lailat al Qadr.\n\n\"If you cooked halva over Ramadan, neighbours would spy on you in order to get a bonus from the state,\" Xhahysa remembers. So as not to attract attention, the ingredients were purchased weeks in advance. \"We would cook halva with the windows closed or curtains drawn\" to curtail the fragrant waft of sugar, nuts and rosewater.\n\nAlamy Albanians had to make certain religious dishes, like halva, in secret during communism (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe punishment if caught preparing a religious feast was harsh. \"We could be taken to a re-education camp for many months to be given a bad job, like cleaning a jail in a remote area,\" recalls Xhahysa, shuddering.\n\nExtreme food shortages led to the loss of other recipes. \"Very few people were allowed to keep animals or farm land,\" explains Bici. Only those in rural areas were allowed to work a 50-sq-m plot and keep a few chickens. \"It was forbidden to own a pig or sheep.\"\n\nEverything was rationed, continues Bici. \"Each month you were allowed 10kg of potatoes and 2kg of cheese per family.\"\n\nWithout easy access to ingredients or cookbooks, centuries-old recipes like tavë krapi (a baked carp casserole) were largely forgotten due to the prohibition of private fishing.\n\nUka Farm Following the fall of communism, many farmers migrated to Albanian cities, leaving only the elderly behind (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\nWhen Albania's borders finally opened up in the 1990s and its national television networks were no longer controlled by the state, many grannies started using TV to revive the nation's long-lost culinary heritage.\n\nBici began cooking on the show The Albanian Sunday in 2007, showcasing recipes she says were cooked \"for thousands of years\", like lakror me arra (an Albanian pie often made with layered ricotta, nettles, leeks, lamb and nuts).\n\nBut while Bici and Pajenga's cooking shows were helping to revive traditional recipes, they were fighting against another tide: farmers in rural Albania were migrating to Tirana in search of work and many rural villages became ghost towns. \"Farming has still not fully recovered from what happened [in the decades after communism],\" says Pajenga.\n\nBici has made it her mission to ensure Albania's traditional recipes aren't forgotten a third time. The grandmother has collated age-old cooking methods in a book, Unique Cuisine of the Albanian Highlands. She also cooks mountain recipes on the TV show Histori Shqiptare (Albanian History).\n\nUka Farm Uka Farm uses recipes from grandmothers like Xhahysa (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\n\"I have many requests from Instagram for old recipes,\" Bici says. \"If youngsters follow my recipe for lakror on TikTok, that's fine too.\"\n\nXhahysa, now a great-grandmother, is also still sharing her knowledge. She started cooking with her grandmother in the 1930s and contributed recipes to Albania's first farm-to-fork restaurant, Uka Farm, a Tirana-based wine bar and agrotourism that has inspired 100 rural farm stays across Albania.\n\nXhahysa's recipe of fërgesë (a baked vegetable dish with cheese) is a popular appetiser at Uka Farm. The farm's butter-fried peppers served with a big dollop of gjizë (a ricotta-style cheese) is a taste of Albania’s forgotten past.\n\nInspired by Pajenga, Bici and other TV-cooking grannies, a 2018 event in Tirana pairing 12 grandmothers with 12 top chefs became an instant Albanian sensation, spawning several granny-meets-millennial TV shows like Gjyshet Milionere (\"Millionaire Grandmothers\").\n\nMullixhiu Chef Bledar Kola has been turning to Albanian grandmothers to revive the nation's traditional cuisine (Credit: Mullixhiu)\n\nThe event was hosted by one of Albania's most famous chefs, Bledar Kola, who has dedicated much of his career to championing traditional Albanian cuisine. \"Not being too cocky,\" says Kola, \"but this show started a small spark on a big fire.\"\n\nAfter a career working in Europe's top restaurants, including stages at Le Gavroche in London and noma in Copenhagen, Kola returned to Tirana a decade ago to present ancient Albanian recipes in a more modern way at the capital's top restaurant Mullixhiu. In the absence of cookbooks, he also picked up skills from an Albanian granny.\n\nNow Kola is going one step further by opening a traditional restaurant in Gjirokaster, a Unesco-inscribed city in southern Albania. At the forthcoming rural restaurant Mullixhino (which is expected to open in late 2025), the focus is squarely on Albania's age-old dishes. \"The cuisine will be garden-inspired, everything cooked on an open fire, in an open kitchen,\" says Kola.\n\nThe restaurant's recipes are an homage to Albanian grandmothers. \"We've been meeting grandmothers for coffee to come up with a great concept,\" says Kola. \"We will serve traditional food from Albania's south, influenced by grandmothers in the region.\"\n\nAlamy Thanks to Albanian grandmothers, the nation's once-forgotten foods are returning (Credit: Alamy)\n\nA new foodie almanac containing 7,000 Albanian ingredients, dishes and cooking methods – many sourced from grandmothers – is also in progress and is being co-written by Kola's brother Nikolin, alongside nine academics.\n\nNikolin believes the book \"will raise awareness of Albanian food, like what René [Redzepi] did for Danish cooking\".\n\nThanks to grannies, Albanian cuisine is finally being reborn.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

The island lies further west than Hawaii; its position on the cusp of East Asia makes it one of Alaska's more remote and idiosyncratic communities.\n\nPart of the Aleutian Islands, a 1,100-mile volcanic archipelago that curves in a westward arc to within 600 miles of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, Unalaska features one of the harshest environments on the planet outside the polar regions. The windswept coastlines are rugged, often precipitous and almost entirely devoid of trees.\n\nBecause of the Aleutians' location in the Pacific Ring of Fire – one of the world's most seismically active areas – earthquakes are ubiquitous, and half of the island chain's 70 volcanoes, including Unalaska's active Makushin volcano, have erupted in the last 250 years. \"Cradle of Storms\" and \"Birthplace of Winds\" are two well-deserved nicknames among locals for the Aleutians. Conflicting weather systems generated in neighbouring seas result in cyclonic storms, hurricane-force winds, heavy rain and dense fog that have a considerable impact upon weather across much of Canada and the continental US.\n\nJohn Zada Unalaska's 4,200 residents live in one of the harshest environments on the planet outside the polar regions (Credit: John Zada)\n\nToday roughly 4,200 people call Unalaska home, including fishermen and the Indigenous Unangax̂ people (pronounced Oo-Nung-akhh). Also referred to as the Aleuts, the Unangax̂ have lived in the archipelago and parts of the Alaska Peninsula for at least 9,000 years, creating a subsistence lifestyle that drew upon every resource that the land and sea offered. But over the past several centuries, the Unangax̂ population has plummeted due to disease and the gradual attrition of their culture that came on the heels of colonialism. Today there are around 2,000 Unangax̂ in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.\n\nRediscovering America Rediscovering America is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\nYet, this wind-battered island has historically been home to another very different group of peoples who also migrated across what is now the Bering Strait: Russians.\n\nAfter Danish explorer Vitus Bering and his Russian colleague Alexei Chirikov became the first-known Europeans to visit the Aleutian Islands in 1741, waves of Russian fur traders flocked to the archipelago to hunt sea otters and fur seals. After establishing a Russian settlement on Unalaska in 1759, the islands officially became a colony of the Russian Empire in the late 1700s. Today many inhabitants still have Russian surnames. The Russian Orthodox Church followed the fur hunters, building small houses of worship across the islands and converting many Unangax̂ to their faith.\n\nAlthough the US gained control of the Aleutian Islands when it purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, the Russian Orthodox legacy has survived. Unalaska's Church of the Holy Ascension is one of a few Russian Orthodox houses of worship that remain. Rebuilt atop its original 1824 location in 1896, it is the oldest cruciform-style Russian Orthodox cathedral in North America, and contains one of Alaska's greatest collection of Russian artefacts, religious icons and artworks – including some that were donated directly from Catherine the Great.\n\nJohn Zada Reverend Evon Bereskin was previously Unalaska's sole Christian Orthodox priest (Credit: John Zada)\n\nBefore the arrival of the current Russian Orthodox priest, reverend Evon Bereskin was Unalaska's sole Christian Orthodox priest and the keeper of the Church of the Holy Ascension from 2013 to 2023. A member of the Unangax̂ community, he oversaw all the parishes in the Aleutian islands.\n\n\"I am constantly in awe of the fact that I [was] the custodian of this incredible relic building,\" he told me. \"It [was] an unbelievable honour and responsibility.\"\n\nAs head of the church, Reverend Bereskin raised funds to restore the church and its icons, which had suffered at the hands of time and the elements. He also changed the liturgy of his services to English (from the Unangax̂ language and old Slavonic) to make services more accessible to worshippers.\n\nPrior to World War Two, the US had a modest commercial and military presence on the Aleutian Islands, which, lying relatively close to East Asia, were vulnerable to attack after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. On 3-4 June 1942, planes from two Japanese aircraft carriers attacked Dutch Harbor in the town of Unalaska on the island's northern coast, killing 50 people. Several days later Japanese forces invaded Kiska and Attu islands, the westernmost islands in the Aleutians (670 and 850 miles from Unalaska, respectively), in an attempt to inflict a psychological blow and divert US forces from the Central Pacific theatre, where the Battle of Midway Island was about to take place. It was the first invasion of US soil since the British incursions in 1812. The SS Northwestern, a passenger and freight steamship used by the US Navy in the war, was destroyed in the Japanese attack on Dutch Harbor. Its rusted hull still rises above the water's surface, a ghostly reminder of a bloody battle.\n\nJohn Zada The SS Northwestern, a steamship destroyed in a WWII Japanese attack, still rises above the water's surface (Credit: John Zada)\n\nWithin months of the Dutch Harbor attack, 145,000 US and Canadian soldiers were deployed to defend and retake the occupied Aleutians. They secured the islands with fortresses, artillery and bunkers, such one on Bunker Hill above Dutch Harbor, which is now the setting of a hike with stunning 360-degree views. A larger base overlooking Unalaska Bay and the Bering Sea a few miles away on nearby Mount Ballyhoo, known as Fort Schwatka, once featured 100 buildings and was built to withstand earthquakes and hurricane-force winds. Epic, harrowing battles were fought on bleak and difficult terrain. Thousands died on both sides of the conflict – many from exposure to the islands' harsh weather. By August 1943, the Japanese were expelled from the Aleutians, and over time, the battles that took place here have been largely forgotten.\n\nAfter the Japanese attacks, the US military ordered the mandatory evacuation of the Unangax̂ from the Aleutians for their safety and to prepare the island for arriving military forces. Residents were given less than a day's notice, allowed one suitcase each and weren't told where they were going or when they would return. In all, 881 Unangax̂ were expelled from nine villages across the archipelago and were interned at abandoned canneries in the temperate rainforests of south-eastern Alaska for three years. Many had never left their homeland before, let alone seen trees.\n\nAround 10% of the camps' population perished due to poor housing and sanitation conditions and limited access to health care. Those who returned to Unalaska in 1945 found their villages either looted or burned down. In the 1980s, the Unangax̂ sued for ill-treatment and deprivation of their rights in conjunction with Japanese Americans who were also interned during the war. In 1988, a restitution law was passed granting financial compensation and an apology to the Unangax̂ from both Congress and the President. Today, an etched stone slab Unalaska serves as is a memorial to that dark period.\n\nAfter World War Two, Unalaska became a hub of the US' commercial fishing industry, which still dominates the island today. Dutch Harbor is the US' top commercial fishing port by volume and the main delivery port featured on Discovery Channel's hit reality show, Deadliest Catch. Four hundred vessels from 14 countries make port here each year, catching several hundred million pounds of fish – around 10% of the entire US fishing industry. Halibut, salmon, herring and several varieties of crab are among the species caught in nearby waters.\n\nJohn Zada Unalaska’s nutrient-rich waters are home to a staggering amount of marine mammals, including orcas, Dall porpoises, sea otters, harbour seals and whales (Credit: John Zada)\n\nAlaskan pollock comprises 80% of all seafood processed on the island and is used to produce fish oil, fish fillets (for frozen fish sticks and McDonald’s Filet-o-Fish sandwiches) and surimi (imitation crab meat) among other products. UniSea, the largest seafood processing plant on the island, has some of the highest environmental standards of any fishery in Alaska, including traceable seafood and lowest by-catch.\n\n\"We use every part of the pollock fish here and nothing goes to waste,\" said Tom Enlow, president and CEO of UniSea and a resident of Unalaska. \"Fish oil gives us a renewable hydrocarbon to help power and heat our plant and worker accommodations, thereby offsetting the burning of diesel.\"\n\nIn addition to an abundance of fish, Unalaska's nutrient-rich waters play host to a rich variety of marine mammals, including orcas, Dall porpoises, sea otters, harbour seals and whales (humpback, pilot and fin). Steller's sea lions gather on isolated rocks known as rookeries to mate and give birth between May and July. The Aleutian coastlines are also home to a nesting seabird population that is larger than that of the rest of the US combined. Bird enthusiasts travel from all over the world to see the varied waterfowl, especially the ultra-rare whiskered auklet.\n\nMeanwhile, hiking Unalaska's trails exposes the remote corners of the island. Traversing its rolling alpine meadows and dramatic mountains is to experience the palpable soul of the Aleutians. These poetic, lyrical landscapes soften the harsh and sometimes unforgiving attributes of a place deeply beholden to the elements.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

More than 64% of the world's travellers are women, with 82% responsible for making a family's travel decisions, according to Skift Research's 2024 The Woman Traveler report. Not only that, but women are also travelling in more ways and to more places than ever before.\n\nSolo female travel is particularly on the rise, with nearly 40% of women travellers planning a solo trip in 2025, according to Skift. This trend also increases with age, as 21% of female travellers aged 55 and up prefer solo travel versus travelling with a spouse or children.\n\n\"Solo travel as a woman feels like a quiet act of rebellion. It is a radical form of self-care, a bold claim to joy and a path to self-actualisation,\" said Lauran Peoples, a director at Richmond Region Tourism in Canada. \"Solo travel allows me to move through the world for no one's benefit but my own. Every time I return, I feel more capable than I give myself credit for. I come back cooler. I come back braver. I come back more in tune with who I truly am.\"\n\nWith their growing financial resources, women are also discerning, choosing destinations with safety, freedom and welcoming cultures in mind. To aid that process, we pulled together some of the most popular ways women around the world are travelling today.\n\nGetty Images Solo female travel is on the rise, but safety remains a top concern (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nSolo female travel\n\nGoogle searches for \"solo female travel\" have increased 1,000% in the past decade, as women look to book more and more trips alone. But compared to men, women have slightly different concerns when planning holidays: safety and cultural attitudes continue to rank top of mind.\n\nAccording to Solo Female Travellers – a company empowering women to travel solo – 66% of female travellers mark safety as their top concern; a figure unchanged since 2020.\n\nThe company's index of more than 200 countries (based on current US/UK advisories, the current Global Peace Index and a survey ranking how solo women travellers viewed their risk while travelling) finds a few places consistently topping the list, including Spain, Australia, the Nordic countries, Thailand, the UK, Singapore, New Zealand, Indonesia and Japan. Japan, which has one of the world's lowest crime rates, ranked number one for safety and stands out as a memorable destination for many solo female travellers.\n\n\"Japan was by far the easiest country I have ever traveled in solo,\" said Georgia Fowkes, a travel expert at Altezza Travel. \"I felt this peculiar but wonderful mix of excitement and utter ease when I arrived in Tokyo. Whether in Shinjuku's buzzing chaos or Kyoto's quiet corners, the streets felt unbelievably safe, even at night.\"\n\nShe found particular ease in women-only train cars and female-focussed capsule hotels. \"It all adds up to a place where you can truly let your guard down and soak it all in,\" she said.\n\nFiona Spinks, who writes the blog Following Fiona, echoes the survey's finding about how female travellers feel welcome in New Zealand. \"Here, it wasn't just about the views (although they're unreal). What stood out most was the people and the way travel in New Zealand often became a real community experience,\" she says. \"When I hiked through the Abel Tasman track, total strangers ended up sharing stories and food. Kiwis love chatting, and you'll gain so much insight from local conversations.\"\n\nTo help support other women-owned businesses on their solo adventures Wanderful, a leading women's travel community, recently launched a map highlighting city guides around the world with women-owned shops, cafes and hotels.\n\nWomen-only group trips\n\n\"Maybe it's the wine, but I laugh more when I travel with women,\" said Kimberlee Lauer, a New Orleans-based senior account executive who travels frequently with her female friends. \"We can be spontaneous and silly together, and we find joy in our shared travel experiences, even when they go awry. I have travelled with my significant others in the past, but I don't really enjoy travelling with men nearly as much as my girlfriends!\"\n\nWhether a girls' getaway or a \"solo-but-not-alone\" trip, group travel built exclusively for women is skyrocketing. Nearly 14% of women are planning a women-only trip in 2025, according to Solo Female Travellers. The survey also found that 36% of women travelled solo on a small group trip, with 8% joining a trip with girlfriends. Road Scholar saw its enrollment in senior-focused women-only tours double in recent years.\n\nMegan Vila, Innovation Manager for TourAxis, recommends women seek out smaller groups and female-led guides. \"Smaller group tours create a more intimate experience and offer a great way to form friendships with other travellers,\" she said. She also recommends itineraries that combine guided activities with plenty of free time. \"Women value expert guidance but also enjoy exploring at their own pace.\"\n\nCruises have emerged as a holiday popular for women, whether already in a group or looking to make new friends. Uniworld recently launched their first women's-only river cruise departing in August 2025 throughout France.\n\n\"Group tours provide something like a tasting menu of different places, so I can see a bit of each city and decide for myself which ones I may want to come back to in the future. I can travel alone, but I'm not actually by myself,\" explained New York resident and frequent group traveller Jessie Parker. \"Get to know the other people in your tour group. There's an instant connection in your choosing the same trip at the same time, so be open to connecting with them as well, not just the location.\"\n\nNatural Habitat Adventures also expanded its women-only itineraries by 75% in 2025, noting that 30% of travellers are women travelling solo. The small, women-led group tours cover destinations like Greenland, Alaska and Costa Rica, focusing on wildlife viewing and highlighting women's history in each destination. Adventure travel continues to be a female-majority space – with women comprising 57% of all adventure travellers.\n\nGetty Images Fit, flush and adventurous, women travellers over 50 seek out set-jetting and bucket list holidays (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nSenior travel\n\nWhile solo travel might have once conjured an image of a young, nomadic backpacker, The Woman Traveler Report by Skift recently busted that myth. Only 4% of adults aged 18-24 planned on embarking on solo trips, while nearly 25% of those aged 65 and above planned a similar journey.\n\nAccording to the report's findings, as women reach retirement age, they look forward to travelling to enjoy freedom and flexibility, escape their routines and challenge themselves. According to a 2023 study by Road Scholar, 85% of the operator's solo travellers are women, and 69% of their overall travellers are women. Barring health or mobility issues, many baby boomer women also set their sights on \"bucket list\" travel.\n\n\"With retirement came the precious gift of time, a treasure to be cherished; immersing myself in the moments that fill my heart and nourish my spirit,\" said Venida Hudley, who solo travelled to 12 African countries in 11 months and chronicled her adventures at Venida Discovers Africa. \"My passion was innovation, so I looked for out-of-the-box volunteer opportunities that fed my spirit like volunteering with an innovative fashion designer in Gaborone, Botswana, and volunteering with a business that creatively improves the environment like Gjenge Makers in Nairobi, Kenya.\"\n\nA 2025 AARP report cited Europe as the most popular destination for international baby boomer travel, with Italy, Great Britain, France, Spain and Ireland in the top positions. At Scotland-based small-group tour company Rabbie's, seniors aged 60 and over receive discounted prices, and they've seen senior women most interested in \"set-jetting\", checking out the Downton Abbey Castle or Outlander filming locations in Scotland. \"The real-life history behind these famous locations is often just as captivating as the fictional storylines they have watched on screen,” says Rabbie's CEO Hazel Rickett. \"Take Doune Castle, for example. Known to Outlander fans as Castle Leoch, it has centuries of its own stories to tell. Some driver-guides were even extras in the series, so they offer first-hand insights.\"\n\nGetty Images Cross-generational travel can be a wonderful way to reconnect and create new moments (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nMulti-generational travel\n\nAnother growing trend has been the emergence of cross-generational travel, driven in large part by millennials and Gen-Z parents who are including both their children and their own parents on their travels. According to American Express Travel's 2025 Global Travel Trends, 58% of millennials and Gen-Z parents plan to bring their extended family on trips in 2025, up from just more than 30% of Gen-X and baby boomers.\n\nFemale-focused tour operator Pink Girls Run the World sees a high percentage of its travellers embark as multigenerational trips. \"Plan experiences that can be shared across multiple generations, like afternoon teas,\" suggests founder Tashieka Brewer. \"Over Mother's Day weekend, we're planning a special multi-generational weekend in Bristol, Virginia and we're planning for a unique wine tasting experience at a local vineyard.\"\n\nStephanie Webb of Seesight Tours echoes the sentiment. \"Some of my most meaningful trips have been with family. I took my mom to Italy, where she finally got to see the Amalfi Coast after dreaming about it for years,\" she said. \"Travelling across generations teaches you patience and appreciation. It's about slowing down, choosing activities that suit everyone's energy levels, and focusing on shared experiences rather than just checking off a bucket list. These trips remind me that travel isn't just about the places we see, but the moments we create together.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "source": "https://www.bloomberg.com/",
        "content": "00:00\n\nThis is \"Wall Street Week.\" I'm David Westin bringing you stories of capitalism. This week, two tales of second acts. Netflix founder Reed Hastings from the top of his Powder Mountain, where he is building a private ski resort for those looking for a little less traffic on the slopes. And from Edna Valley, California, former Raytheon CEO Bill Swanson shows us how he is combining his experience running a major defense firm with what his Croatian grandfather taught him about growing grapes. But we start with a story of reflection, reflecting back on a time only 5 short years ago, when the coronavirus caused one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. But with the world back to normal, we can now reflect on what has changed, what has not, and how the world can better prepare itself for the next time. -I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well-being of all Americans. We have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing, and reducing large gatherings. [Siren wailing] Westin: Most of us remember where we were in mid-March of 2020-- a time of empty streets, lockdowns, and economic turmoil. The S & P 500 slumped close to 20% in one month. The US economy simply came to a stop almost overnight. And initial jobless claims surged to more than 6 million in a matter of weeks. -This blows away even the forecasts. Almost 6.7 million this week. It just goes to point out how bad this is for the overall US economy. -Well, the global economy, of course, including the US and Europe, got a huge shock. Westin: Torsten Slok is Apollo's chief economist. -The shock created quite some significant changes for different sectors, because when you suddenly had in 2019 that the way the economy was working with services playing a certain role, goods playing a certain role, and from one day to the other, goods played a much, much bigger role because we were sitting at home ordering things online and services, we couldn't go out to restaurants, we couldn't go to theme parks, we couldn't travel, suddenly got a huge decline. That change, of course, played a significant role in how the economy responded. -Wash your hands off or use hand sanitizer. Westin: Two of the sectors affected were travel... -Pretty much every aspect of travel changed. I mean, it went off a cliff for quite a while. Westin: and health care. -You know, I always say trust is the currency of public health. And right now, it's bankrupt. Westin: Health care was where we all were focused in the spring of 2020. Dr. Charity Dean is now CEO and co-founder of the Public Health Company. But in 2020, she was the assistant director of the California Department of Public Health. She was one of the very first to see COVID-19 for what it was and could become, and became a major figure in the Michael Lewis book \"The Premonition: A Pandemic Story.\" -The COVID response was a massive systems failure on every level-- across national security, across civilian public health, across the great American companies that hold up our economy. We did not actually have the capabilities to respond to it, and my view of that gets clearer and clearer. 5 years later, as I understand just how deep that devastation was, I still believe that the gift of COVID is it exposed the problems so that we Americans could do what we do best, and that is innovate solutions. I think Americans learned a tough lesson. That is, no one's coming to save you. Westin: A 2023 Gallup poll found that Americans' trust in the medical system fell in the years following COVID, from 44% in 2021 to 34% two years later. -The tension between civil liberties and providing for the common defense of Americans is the oldest tension in public health. It's as old as our country. Ever since there were vaccines, there's been the argument over vaccine mandates. I am not afraid of that debate because it's the right debate to have. Protecting individuals' right to choose versus protecting the whole. I massively support vaccine requirements for kiddos entering public schools. Why? Because the kids that are vulnerable, they have a right to an education that is safe. They have a right to attend school and not worry they're going to get infected by measles because someone else wasn't vaccinated. Having said that, Americans questioning a vaccine mandate during COVID, I think that's just very American. It's who we are. At our core, we're rebels fighting for our freedom, fighting for our individual liberty. That's what founded this country. So, I'm not afraid of that discussion. And I understand American parents who are hesitant, who have lost faith in public health. All of my kids are vaccinated, and so am I. You know, the question of employer vaccine mandates or military vac-- I will leave that to those more qualified to answer those questions, Secretary Hegseth and others who are running those departments, but I'm not surprised that that became a question in Americans' minds, because it-- it's the right debate to have. Westin: Ultimately, we were relieved to some extent from the pandemic by the development of a new vaccine and a new platform for a vaccine. Science really stepped up in the private sector, stepped up in the end. Where are we today, though, on vaccines? That became a political issue in and of itself. And even today, we have a new secretary of health, right, who is really skeptical about vaccines. We have a measles problem right now because of small children not getting inoculated. Where are we with our confidence in vaccinations? -Yeah. I love this topic because it's the juicy one and most people are afraid to talk about it. Americans developed a distrust of what they were told from public health officials about the safety of the COVID vaccine, and I understand. They want to protect their children and they want to make the best decisions. And for parents, it's hard to do that when you don't know who to trust. But make no mistake, the COVID vaccine saved millions and millions of lives, not because it prevented all infections, but because it prevented people from dying. Instead of dying, they got really sick, or instead of getting really sick, they had a minor cough. And so, it saved millions of lives. Operation Warp Speed, that was led by the first Trump administration, it's one of the greatest successes of public-private collaboration in American history. What they pulled off, that's phenomenal. And I think we can replicate that across a number of areas. How do we restore Americans' trust in what public health officials tell them about vaccines? Transparency, sharing the science, answering the questions. Westin: If Americans have struggled to regain their trust in the health care system, they've shown little trouble rediscovering their zest for travel. TSA checkpoint volume has rebounded to higher levels than before the pandemic. Brian Kelly is the founder of The Points Guy and author of the book \"How to Win at Travel.\" -There were multiple days in 2024 where there were over 3 million passengers going through the TSA, record-setting numbers. I think the biggest thing is business travel. You know, there was such a huge block of Monday-to-Thursday consultants and salespeople and traveling for every meeting via plane, and that has not returned. Now, business travel has returned in different ways and more conferences, but that has impacted pricing because the consumer, throughout the pandemic, there were amazing deals to get premium economy and get a taste of business class at a fraction of the cost. And I think what happened is consumers got used to sitting up front at those discounted rates, and now that those rates have come up, they're still not as high as what they used to charge business travelers. So, consumers are taking fewer trips but spending a lot more. That's one of the biggest trends. We've seen the reemergence of multigenerational family trips, where people are spending a lot. Even though there has been a call back to office, so many people still have those flexible work environments and are working from abroad. So, while traditional business travel has not bounced back at the same levels, it just looks different these days. Westin: While the pandemic changed the way the consumer traveled, it also changed the way companies operate, such as hotels. -Many mid-tier hotels have gotten rid of daily housekeeping and gotten rid of room service and stocking minibars. You know, originally those were cut in the name of safety, but I think a lot of that is actually out of cost-cutting. A lot of the industry saw an opportunity to cut back on their services that they offer and get consumers used to it. You know, at the highest end of luxury, there has been pushback, and, you know, from my experience staying at ultra-5-star hotels, things are even better pre-pandemic. But in that 3- and 4-star hotel, they have gotten consumers used to not getting daily housekeeping or at least having to request it in the name of safety. And it has shown--the hotel companies are doing incredible. They're all growing at rapid rates. Westin: Kelly says the growing push to require workers to return to the office will only help business travel, but Slok warns there's still a long way to go. If we go back 5 years, almost all of us were working from home, something that I don't know we'd thought about before. How much did it change the working patterns and the uses of offices and getting together in the office place? -And this is really important today, in particular for commercial real estate and office, including here in Manhattan, because there are studies by Nick Bloom, who is a professor at Stanford, who shows that today, if you look at the data, we still only have 50% of the workweek, meaning-- and the office relative to what we had in 2019. So, that's another way of saying that when you measure how many people swipe their cards going into office buildings, not only in Manhattan but across the country, you have that we are still only an occupancy rate on a weekly basis that is 50% of what it was in 2019, and that has had implications for if we don't come as much into the office, of course, then we don't go and eat lunch in the middle of the day. We don't at the same time commute. Therefore, we don't use public transportation. So, measures of public transportation, including in New York City, are still only-- For example, subway usage is only around 2/3 of where it was in 2019. So, working from home has definitely changed in a lot of different ways, and there's also huge, blossoming academic literature about does that mean that productivity is lower? Or does it actually mean that productivity is higher? Westin: Whether working from home is more productive or less productive, it does affect employment in all the businesses ancillary to the office building. So, there are employment ramifications of working from home. -Absolutely, and that's also why you have seen a shift also on a sector basis there, that there are still some challenges, exactly, in everything-- if you used to buy something when you drove to work, then people just now at home all day long and they're not having lunch, they're maybe not shopping the same patterns they did before. Maybe they buy things more online, which is exactly what all the trends are showing. It is the case also that now it's more possible for people to get a job remotely. So, that's why if you look at some of the job openings, they have been putting more in the postings that there is much more significant now number of job postings that ask for this job can also be done remotely. Westin: But it wasn't just different sectors that were affected in different ways. It was different countries, too. -I would say there was just a good, old-fashioned policy mistake. -Sweden was the odd man out during the pandemic. Westin: And that is where we turn next. From New Zealand to Sweden, countries pursued very different strategies in responding to the pandemic. Where has that left them 5 years later? That's next on \"Wall Street Week.\" When COVID-19 hit 5 years ago, cities and states and entire countries simply shut down-- schools, businesses, public events-- but not every government took the same approach. Some went a very different way. -I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. -We will close our border to any nonresidents and citizens attempting to travel here. -We are not telling people to stay indoors. Westin: Looking back on it, can we see that one worked better than the other? -Well, I do think we can conclude now. Of course, we all had to make sure that the health was the number-one priority. But there were certainly also different countries, including New Zealand and Sweden, that also took different approaches and therefore ended up having also different outcomes. And it has generally been the case today, now that we know that the pandemic, quote unquote, only lasted for a somewhat limited time, that it did turn out to be a better situation to have allowed more flexibility and not be so rigid in terms of what the health restrictions were. -Sweden is one that took that less restrictive approach, avoiding lockdown measures and letting people decide for themselves, an approach that was ridiculed around the world. -As a Swede, I felt quite attacked and harassed during the pandemic, and both foreign friends and media constantly got in touch, asking me, \"Are you all crazy over there in Sweden?\" And we got it from, I mean, from all sides of the political spectrum as well. People saying that Sweden is a cautionary tale. I read that in the \"New York Times.\" And President Donald Trump at the time said that, look, Sweden is suffering tremendously. Hundreds of thousands of Americans would die if we do what the Swedes do. So, we were basically not very popular at that time, and it felt like we had to defend ourselves. I think many people had a vested interest in explaining the Swedish model a failure before we saw the results. Westin: And the results, as it turned out, were better than expected. Johan Norberg is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. His report on Sweden's pandemic response found that where models forecast a death toll of more than 80,000 by July 2020, Sweden had suffered fewer than 6,000 by that point. -The other aspect is what-- is what the Swedish public health agency said. Yes, we might have more cases and deaths early on in Sweden, but this will even out in the long run because no country can completely shut itself off unless they're a tiny island far away from everything. And this is exactly what happened. If you look at total cumulative excess deaths during the whole pandemic period, Sweden came out with one of the lowest excess death rates all over Europe and less than half of the excess death rate of Britain and the United States. So, I think in the end, when we look at the numbers, when we look at the data, I think even some of the opponents of the Swedish model would say that, yeah, we didn't risk people's lives. In fact, it worked out better than in most other rich countries. Westin: Half a world away, New Zealand took yet a third approach. It locked down its borders and implemented strict lockdown measures to avoid community transmission, suffering just 25 deaths from COVID in 2020. But it meant the country was effectively shut off from the rest of the world. Sharon Zollner is the chief economist for New Zealand at ANZ Bank. -It was chaos when COVID first hit, of course, like it was everywhere. Massive uncertainty about what was going to happen. We saw a crash in business confidence. We saw monetary policy eased dramatically and, of course, we had the wage subsidies rolled out very quickly. Of course, inevitably it was a bit slapdash, but I think probably the single biggest forecasting mistake we all made, the government, the Reserve Bank, private sector, was underestimating just how effective those wage subsidies were going to be. Essentially, we were thinking of COVID as primarily a big negative shock to demand, that it was going to destroy confidence that we were at risk of a depression. And, of course, the GDP numbers were all over the place. You hit pause on an economy and you get crazy things like GDP falling 20% in a quarter. But what we learned ultimately was that those numbers didn't mean anything. All our models saying if GDP does this, then house prices will do that, or GDP does that, employment-- this will happen to employment, they all broke immediately, of course, because this wasn't a normal slowdown in GDP. It was an artificial stop and then a restart and then a stop and then a restart. The data, of course, was pandemonium. And it was--it was-- it's easy with hindsight to spot the mistakes that were made. But essentially, it boils down to diagnosing COVID as primarily a demand shock. It was not. It was primarily a supply shock once you take into account the wage subsidy. So, essentially, people were sitting at home. They figured out that their jobs were safe. They worked out that they were very bored and that interest rates were the lowest we've ever seen. The housing market started to take off, and everyone went internet shopping. And we saw as well as just a surge in demand, we saw a big substitution from services to goods. So, you couldn't go on holiday to Fiji, so, you got a spa instead. Westin: New Zealand spent close to $20 billion between 2020 and 2021 in a wage subsidy program that supported 47% of its jobs. -The first lockdowns were incredibly expensive, of course, the fiscal policy, but they were hugely successful. They bought us, you know, a year of normality that other economies didn't have. But I would say there was just a good, old-fashioned policy mistake from fiscal policy and monetary policy. If you look at fiscal policy, other countries also went all out with the wage subsidies and a big surge in spending, but then they wound it back very quickly. We didn't. We didn't have to because our government debt was very low to start with in an international comparison. We also had a left-leaning government. They had pre-funded using that long--long-- large-scale asset program, so, they had money sitting there saying, \"What shall I do with this?\" And they had a very, very ambitious reform program in a whole lot of areas, nothing to do with COVID. So, the fiscal policy remained extremely expansionary for years. So, at the same time, the--the private sector demand was very, very strong because of the super-low interest rates. And so, we had pro-cyclical fiscal policy. We had monetary and fiscal policy ultimately working against each other. You know, monetary policy is a lot quicker to turn. And so, the Reserve Bank is like, oops, OK, inflation's an awful lot higher than we thought. The economy is actually a lot more overheated than we thought. We need to change direction. Fiscal policy is a much, much slower ship to turn, even if all your weight's on the wheel. And it wasn't. So, essentially, for quite a long period, you had monetary and fiscal policy working against each other. Of course, we've had a doozy of a recession. We had a very large recession last year. So, fiscal policy has also started to turn, but we're still forecasting deficits on all the metrics for years to come. So, essentially, the main difference between the economy before COVID and now is that our government debt has broadly doubled. So, it still looks quite reasonable in an international comparison, but our entire country is built on a fault line. There's nowhere in New Zealand that is really safe from that risk. And then we've got, you know, more extreme weather happening as well. And we've got an infrastructure deficit. We've got an aging population, like everywhere. So, we've got some significant medium-term fiscal challenges. Westin: COVID eventually did break through New Zealand's borders in early 2022, and the death toll spiked, just as other countries, like Sweden, were emerging from the worst of it. -Sweden is a small and very trade-dependent country, so, when the rest of the world suffers and locks down, the Swedish economy suffers, too, but the decline in Sweden was much more shallow than in other places, and the recovery was much quicker. Interestingly, when we looked at the end of 2021, where economies were compared to the forecasts before the pandemic, then we could see that by the end of 2021, the world economy was 3% smaller than forecasts had expected. The Euro economy was a bit more than 2% smaller. The US economy was 1.2% smaller. The Swedish economy was actually 0.4% bigger than the forecasts from the OECD and the IMF expected before the pandemic. So, it tells you that by staying open, by not shutting down society, we saved the economy. Westin: In the end, it may be hard to be sure which of the range of approaches worked better than others. We'd all rather forget about the pain and uncertainty of 5 years ago, which may make it hard to anticipate the next one and know which way to go. -During the pandemic era, we had more attention paid to Sweden than ever before, I think, and I was constantly asked about what was going on in Sweden, but afterwards, not a sound. Very few got in touch to see what actually happened, and you're actually one of the few media companies to get in touch to think about, OK, we all thought that Swedes were crazy and that everything was going to the dogs. Now, 5 years later, what really happened? You would think that that would be of interest to people, but it seems like we just want to forget and move on. -More bad, spooky stuff is possible today than ever before, but so is the tooling. I am surrounded by a tribe of people, public servants, some of whom are in government, some of whom are out of government, who are working on building those solutions today for defense, for health security, for intelligence, and I am ever full of hope. Coming up, we tell the stories of two very different second acts from highly successful CEOs, starting with Netflix founder Reed Hastings and how his quest for smaller crowds on the ski slopes led him to buy an entire mountain. This is a story about second acts, something F. Scott Fitzgerald said didn't exist in American lives, but something successful CEOs are pursuing with gusto. Every year, tens of millions of people flock to hundreds of slopes across the country to satisfy the leg workout they crave all summer long. In the 2023-2024 ski season, over 60 million people went skiing and snowboarding across the country, a growth of 7% over 10 years. And as the sport has become more accessible through multi-mountain passes, and climate change shortens the length of the ski season, more experienced skiers and snowboarders are craving exclusivity... -There's 5,000 acres through here. Westin: something Reed Hastings decided to do something about. -We're at Powder Mountain. It's 10,000 acres of skiing. One of the largest resorts in the world. Half of it, roughly, is public, and half of it is Powder Haven or a private skiing resort. And it's been tremendously exciting these last two years to be putting this together. Westin: You might recognize Hastings from his 25-year tenure as CEO of Netflix. He joined the board of Bloomberg LP in October of 2023. Hastings started Netflix back in 1997, growing it from a DVD rental service with $270,000 in annual revenue its first year into a global streaming giant, bringing in $33.7 billion when he stepped down in 2023. -David, we're one of the areas that is a new neighborhood coming. So, it's beautiful aspens, incredible views. There'll be 37 lots here. That's our land. Westin: But through it all, Hastings maintained his passion for skiing. When did you first ski? Where did you find your love of skiing? -Well, I was fortunate that my mom was a skier. And so, we skied most years as a Christmas vacation. But I wasn't hardcore. I wasn't a ski racer, wasn't all of that, and that was up until I was 20 or so, and then my twenties, I didn't ski, and then forties and fifties, we had kids, and we got a place in Park City, so, that was tremendous. But again, I was, you know, full time in Netflix. I was maybe 10 days a year of skiing. What had happened in Park City is long lines, big crowds, no powder. So, we moved here, which is about an hour away. Westin: Do you remember the first time you came to Powder? -Yeah, absolutely. It was Christmas in 2016. Super crowded in Park City. Drove over here and then it was just wide open. Incredible powder. We fell in love with uncrowded, the high altitude, which keeps the snow very good, and the community. Very warm and generous. -What's up? -And then I retired from Netflix and then invested in Powder and eventually started running it. Westin: You heard that right. Reed loved the mountain so much, he bought it. The Netflix tycoon is now taking on a new challenge-- building and partially privatizing a ski resort community after identifying a part of the market he thought wasn't being served. -You're only really making a difference when you're changing the rules. At Powder, we're the first one to be fusing private club skiing and public skiing together. In golf, about 25% of US golf courses, 4,000 and 16,000, are private. And that's because you get better tee times, you get a clubhouse, social interaction. Sometimes they're residential, sometimes not. But in skiing, it's really just been Yellowstone Club and Wasatch Peaks Ranch. So, we're only the third out of 500. So, there's tremendous demand as people move to the subscription club orientation. So, changing the ski industry is something that's the next big challenge. Westin: There was an attempt here on Powder Mountain before, which I think brought you here originally. Why did that one fail and why is this one different? -You know, that was all public skiing, and it's very difficult to compete with Epic and Ikon. Those are really the transformative forces for high-crowded, low-cost resorts. And Powder tried to differentiate but did not have the private skiing. So, I was here, just as a member or as a homeowner, and then post-Netflix, I had the time and I had the capital, fortunately, to really do this transformation. Westin: Wow do you grow this business? -You know, if I was younger, I might be tempted to, like, try to replicate this and do them in every state of the Union. But for me, we're just going to build one incredible boutique. It's a real estate business. The difference here is when the owner-operator lives in the community, it's really driven from the community. So, that's true of Yellowstone. It's true of Powder. We're building up the clubhouse and the club restaurants and building a lodge and doing other things to make it so you can spend a long time. Westin: Hastings has a real estate team devoted to the mountain, the first phase of a 5- to 10-year project. -We're really upgrading everything. We expanded land to be able to fit both a fantastic private skiing experience, and private skiing is 600 families get to enjoy 5,000 acres. I mean, it's fantastic. You know all the people on the lift because of the clubbiness. There's untracked powder days after the last storm. It's fantastic. And then also to have a really vibrant public resort. And we're building that up over the next 5, 10 years and really, to make Powder a sense of curated beauty where art plays a major role. And so, it's the crossover of people who are enhanced and inspired by art, as well as love the adrenaline of skiing. -So, the Powder Haven development phasing is at its early infancy. Although Powder Mountain has been around for over 50 years, this private portion of the development is really quite new and we are just starting releasing those units and those lots right now. Westin: Brooke Hontz is the chief development and construction officer at Powder Haven, the exclusive, private ski-in, ski-out community at Powder Mountain. -Powder Mountain caters to all types of skiers and snowboarders, from first-time skiers through expert, who have a passion and enjoyment of really the sport in its kind of more natural forms, because currently on the mountain, we have not a lot of amenities and it's more of a natural, what skiing used to be and what people, a lot of people, particularly those with mega passes, say, \"That's what I love about skiing.\" So, people that buy into Powder Mountain as part of the club will be able to share their homes with others through an internal rental program. And so, if you're a guest or an owner at Powder Mountain, you would be able to rent or take part in a lease program with other owners, but otherwise, know that membership is closed. Westin: Taking Powder private, even in part, has not been without controversy, with one snowboarder who's used the public resort for years telling \"The Hollywood Reporter\" that, quote, what is happening at Powder Mountain is awful because of the partial exclusivity. Are you losing any skiers who really miss the pure public part of it? -Probably. You know, it's inevitable that as we change and add private, it's going to lose some. But we've made a big effort to really embrace, to increase compensation for all the employees. Open up inexpensive night ski. It's $19 to ski from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Super popular, you know, in the local high school, that kind of thing. So, you know, we're making big investments in staying accessible and open for people. Westin: And other longtime powder skiers, like Larry Wolf, say it's worth it. -I think it's a win-win. He's made a lot of improvements that I'm very pleased with. For example, he said he was going to put in 4 new lifts in a year, and he put in 4 new lifts in a year. So, we now have access to terrain that was only typically available through cat skiing or skinning. The alternative being owned by large corporations or owned by people who don't get it would ruin the place, and I think he gets it and it keeps the--the flavor and the spirit of Powder Mountain alive. -The opportunity here is so different and unique. Not only are we at a slightly different price point than other private skiing, our skiing is more massive in terms of sheer magnitude of acreage, but we also have a wide variety of ability levels. And you're at the top of the mountain almost all of the day versus continuing to return to the bottom. So, every time you finish your day or start your day, you're doing that at the top to see sunrise and sunset. I think the inclusion of the art installation and how unique that is in the world of skiing and resort makes us more creative and hopefully interesting to people. Westin: That type of creativity ultimately reflects Hastings. From media mogul to ski resort oracle, he has drawn from his past life to pursue his second act, this time without the same pressure to maximize the bottom line. -But we don't want to be cookie-cutter. Westin: You are investing a lot of capital investment into lifts, facilities here, and things like that. How does the money flow? How do you cover that cost? -Well, when I think about it, I think of sports teams and I think of Steve Cohen of the Mets or Ryan Smith with the Jazz or my friend Steve Ballmer with the Clippers. And that's big money. In comparison, it's not so much-- not as big an investment, but I think it's similar. You know, for them it's an expression of joy and passion and winning and making a contribution to the public. And for me, it's the same kind of thing, but it's more again, skiing instead of those teams. And then we make money by selling season passes and we make money by selling real estate. Those are the two big revenue generators. The value in the long term is unclear because other ski mountains haven't had that same track record. But I would say we're investing, you know, to really make it a spectacular community experience. Westin: So, obviously, when you built Netflix, it must have been all-consuming. Does this engage you to the same level? Are you as consumed with this as you were with Netflix? -You know, it's different muscles. Netflix was super analytic, super internet scale strategy. This is more about caring and intimacy and making people feel good in a boutique. So, it's a different skill set. It's kind of, I think, what makes it fun. I wouldn't want to go back and try to do another high-scale internet company. How am I ever going to do better than Netflix? So, this is in a completely different realm. Westin: Do you have the same sense of purpose about Powder Mountain as you did about something like Netflix? -It's a very strong sense of purpose to create a place of incredible beauty that sparks wonder and that people are talking about for 100 years. So, think of it as a physical legacy rather than a brand like Netflix's legacy. Part of Netflix's success was a very unique culture that really focused on the high-talent people and giving them freedom to operate, and I have brought that culture here to Powder Mountain. And so, for the employees, it's an incredible opportunity to thrive and to get freedom and to have responsibility. A difference is it's much more emphasizing love and emotion and connection back to the intimacy. Netflix was around super performance and Powder is around connection and sparking wonder, we call it. Westin: Coming up, we go from the snowy slopes of Ogden, Utah to the sunny slopes of the Edna Valley in California for the story of Bill Swanson, who made missiles when he ran Raytheon and today makes Pinot Noir and Chardonnay as he runs his vineyard. That's next on \"Wall Street Week.\" This is the second chapter in our story about second acts, turning from Reed Hastings creating a private ski resort in Utah to the former Raytheon CEO starting a new chapter on his vineyard in California's Edna Valley. -The key to me is that when you have a lot of people work for you, you realize what happens to them after they retire. And one of the things I found is that you can't fish for 7 days. You can't play golf 7 days a week. You got to keep your mind going. And those that had a way to keep their mind going lived the long lives, and those that didn't weren't with us very long. Westin: Bill Swanson spent 42 years at defense contractor Raytheon, rising from mechanical engineer to become its chairman and CEO. During his time in charge, the company's market capitalization went from $12.7 billion to $31 billion. -So, it convinced me that I had to find a way to do something and be engaged after I retired. Westin: Swanson's roots in wine go back to his childhood and a grandfather who immigrated from Croatia to grow grapes on the coast of central California. -My grandfather made wine in the basement and his red wines were so thick you could probably put a fork in them. And as kids, we learned at an early age that my grandmother would take a saucer, she'd make homemade bread, and my grandfather's red wine would be put in the saucer, and you dip the bread in the wine, and as a kid, we stomped. If you know \"I Love Lucy,\" the scene, we did it. We had purple ankles and everything else as little kids, but I stomped grapes when I was growing up. What I learned from him was a real passion about the vineyard and about the vines. Westin: How did you balance running a vineyard with running Raytheon? -I scared my board because they didn't know what I was doing. I had to explain to them that this is something I wanted to do. And so, things moved slowly for a while, and I was more of a hands-off owner at the time, except for capitalization, funds, and so forth. But then in 2015, I retired and then, as I was wrapping things up, I became more involved with the winery, and that's when I decided that if I wanted to move quick, I had to own the entire property and can make things happen at the speed I wanted. Westin: Swanson brought with him to the hills outside San Luis Obispo his remarkable collection of Ferraris, all red, with a few Ford GT40s mixed in, memorabilia from his time at Raytheon, and a wealth of engineering and management experience, a good part of which he applied to growing great wines. -This is a little like aerospace. You can make changes, but you don't see them for a while. And so, as an example, we took out 10 acres in front of Chardonnay and we planted our own varietals. We will not see the product out of that vineyard for probably 4 or 5 years. And so, you make a capital investment that you don't see for a long time. It's like building an aircraft. And so, this business has taught me a little more about patience than I had in aerospace. That flag was given to me by the Marines. It flew in Saddam Hussein's palace. Westin: Oh, wow. -Yeah, it's kind of a-- Westin: I was in that palace. -So, you can see. Westin: Yeah. Baghdad, Iraq, August 7th. -And then this is really special to me. That was the 2013 Boston Marathon. Westin: Oh, boy. -I was in Washington. My wife was in our place in downtown, two blocks away from the bombing. And so, then we went in and did all the security for the next marathon. We put in all the command posts and everything. So, the state police gave me a Distinguished Service Award, and the head of sneaker company gave me one-half of the shoe of the winning marathon. Westin: Oh, is that right? -Yeah. So, this was the guy that ran the marathon, his shoe. Westin: Jeez. Winemaking is an art. But from my experience in dealing with artistic people, you have to watch it, because there's also some business involved in it, because they'd like to be artists and not worry about the business. How do you get that blend right? -Well, that was one of the neat things about coming out of aerospace. As you probably know, I could tell you the price of everything in a missile or a radar or computer system or display. And when I got in this business, there's really no set easy way to figure it out. Westin: Swanson quickly figured out his formula, from barreling... How long do you age them in the barrels, typically? -Typically, it could go anywhere from 18 months to 24 months or so forth. Westin: to bottling. -Today's bottling day. It's super active here in the lab. We're tracking all of the parameters that make sure that we're--that the wines are in spec. -Bottling's exciting because it's the final step in a wine's life. There's a lot of steps to get to where we are today, so, we're bottling right now a lot of wines from 2023, so, it's been a year and a half in the making. Westin: Nathan Carlson and Kevin Bargetto are Center of Effort's winemakers, the men behind Swanson's distinct formula for the vineyard's wine. -Looking at things like the fill height, which is regulated by the government. Wants it to be the amount of wine that it states on the label, but also for wines that are going to age for a long time, it's super important that we're not picking up a lot of oxygen during the bottling process, that we have our, our free SO2 is in line to keep the wine protected for the long term. And so, all of those things become really important. Westin: All the processes go back to one thing: the grapes. -What's beautiful about here is the temperature is always-- it's pretty much always perfect. It's never much more than 85 degrees in this valley. During the hottest time of the summer, at the end of the afternoon, you'll see a big wall of fog kind of marching in from the sea. And so, that makes this especially good for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir varieties that need that cooler climate. And it helps to keep natural acidity really tight. It makes the wines really have good longevity. Everything about our property, it's really tied to the sea. The breeze that's coming in behind me. The soils were all under the ocean not that long ago. All of these mountains kind of pushed out of the sea floor. And so, we'll find, we'll find fossils in the soil pretty often. This is really-- when this dries out, it's just kind of like light beach sand all around us here. When you have vines growing in really poor soil, it makes them struggle to live, and that makes the fruit more intense. -What's fascinating is you learn in this business that you're a farmer, and there are things you can control and things you can't control, and one of them is the weather. And so, for us, we will now start to get into a critical period of frost. Most people think of frost in the fall, but what happens now is we're out pruning, and pretty soon, we'll have bud break, and that's when we can have temperature extremes. You'll notice this whole property, we farm sustainably. We make all our wine sustainably. We care about the environment with our packaging and everything. We don't get any more for our wines price-wise for that. But everybody here feels like we're returning what we're given better than what we got it, and that's what sustainability's all about. Westin: What's the objective? Is it to make money? Is it for the fun of it? Why are you really doing it? -I think I would answer in the way that for 42-plus years, I worked for the shareholders, and I believed I did right by them, but it wasn't my brand. COE, or Center of Effort, is my brand. It's something that we own and it's something that I have the ability to give back and provide a life and security to 30 or 35 people here, or produce a product that people enjoy. And I think for me, getting emails or phone calls or meeting somebody that says, \"I enjoyed your wine. It was terrific. I know why you do it,\" means a lot. And then things happen out of the blue. Our GM, Nathan Carlson, showed me a photo. I get choked up a little bit. It's a photo of our bottle of wine. It's the only thing that survived in this woman's house, in the fire in L.A. And she's happy because there's a bottle of Center of Effort that survived. That's pretty neat. Westin: Well, you mentioned the aerospace training and things like safety training. When you came in, where did you see parallels or overlaps? Things--That's the way we did it at Raytheon. It could apply here as well. -Jeez. Everything applied. I mean, it was-- It was a different way of looking at things. When I found that diversity of thought, background, religion, gender, all of those things, when they come into a problem, you have a different way of looking and solving at it. And what I found here is that my background, the team's background, and everything, when you look at something, we come up with pretty good solutions, and that's really the key to it that I think that's what everybody's background brings. And here, everybody is what we call part of the COE family. The 30, 35 people are our family. Westin: What advice would you give to another high-powered, successful CEO who's looking at retirement? -My advice: threefold. First one is learn how to say no, because you're going to be asked to do a bunch of things and you're so used to agreeing to doing things because somebody would tell you you had to do them. \"No\" it's a hard thing to learn. The second thing is, don't give yourself away wholesale when you get retail. So, do something that, if you're going to do it, get compensated for it, or do it in a way that monetizes it in your well-being and so forth. And the third thing is find something you really love to do. And so, for me, I love wine. Making it. I love collecting cars. So, I planned for my retirement so I would be busy and my planning paid off. I'm busy. Westin: Coming up, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers on flipping a coin on inflation. Numbers for the US economy have been getting softer, with some economists returning to talk about a possible recession. Our special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard has spent a good part of his career advising presidents on the state of the economy, and he is more concerned than he has been recently. -David, I, I think we've seen a sea change in perception in the just almost two months since President Trump was inaugurated. At that time, the prevailing view was very strong economy, possibly inflation, risk, United States exceptionalism relative to the rest of the world likely to manifest itself in continued US outperformance. But the combination of substantial immigration restrictions, substantial layoffs in possible prospect from the federal government, the damage to US competitiveness and to US production done by tariffication and, above all, a big increase in risk premiums have led to a-- sharp reductions in spending on the part of both consumers and on the part of businesses, and even more sharp reductions in intended future spending. You saw that, for example, when Delta Airlines reported a soft first quarter. So, you take all that together. You take the fact that markets were starting at a very high level in terms of valuation, and I think you have to say that there's in the range of, I'd say still slightly below, a 50% chance of a recession starting this year. Westin: So, taking you very literally about that close to 50% chance, for our audience, what numbers should they be looking at to determine what side of that 50% we end up on? -They should be looking at data that points a little bit over the horizon. Data on order books of businesses, data on consumer intentions to buy a car or to buy a house in the next several months as an indicator for judging what is going to happen. All those things taken together, I think, will tell a story. There's also information in what is happening to commodity prices. And I pay a lot of attention to the various compilations that come from investment analysts who are very close to firms who are reporting which way the firms are revising their own forecasts of future revenue and future earnings. All of that are the sort of indicators of what's happening in the economy. I think at a different level, the thing to be looking at is are we getting more policy certainty or are we getting more policy uncertainty? Every time there's a major vacillation, every time there's a question about commitment to law and commitment to following the law in any sphere, you're going to be getting more uncertainty that is ultimately a prospect for chilling investment. Westin: So, President Trump has addressed this and said we're going through what he called a transition period on the way to what he called something very big here. To try to argue his side of it, is this a necessary sort of transition to rebalance the economy, get the government out of the economy to the extent that it was, and really go forward to a better future for the economy? -No. Look, David. Transition period. Doesn't it sound like--a lot like the word \"transitory\"? The idea of transitory inflation, when it was put forward by the Biden administration and the Fed when things weren't going well, didn't work out very well, and I don't think the idea that this is some kind of transition period is going to work out very well at all. Why do we think that it is going to help the US economy to not be able to use Mexico and Canada as a production partner, given that we are competing with Asia and Europe? I don't see what that logic is. Why is scaring people about whether they're going to get their Social Security benefits, scaring people about whether the United States is going to continue to develop new medicines at the NIH, why are those things thought likely to increase confidence? If this was going to increase confidence and people saw it, you'd expect to see surveys of consumer confidence showing an improvement in conditions, and you don't see that at all. I think by far the more likely thing is that we are in the shallow end and we're walking towards the deep end, and the problems are only going to increase with the passage of time. You know, this is not the first time that a country got a new leader who gave a lot of orders and imposed a lot of tariffs. That populist-policy mix is a standard around the world, particularly common in Latin America. And what the studies show is that it can go either way in terms of its impacts in the short run, but it's almost always bad over the medium to long run. So, I'd expect, unless there's a reversal in policy, I would expect this situation to get more serious. Every time he recommits, pessimism increases. And so, I think those explanations of downturn being temporary are actually quite counterproductive. Westin: Larry, to play devil's advocate, I think that if somebody were here from the Trump administration, they'd say, \"The transition is to a world where we have a bigger manufacturing base.\" We had Shawn Fain from the UAW just recently say he thinks what he's doing, he's exactly right, because we've lost so many jobs. Is there an argument that, in fact, we could be rebuilding the manufacturing base that could help the economy in the long term? -Manufacturing has trended downwards for 60 years. It has trended downwards in Germany as a share of the economy. It has even trended downwards in China as a share of the economy. There's a reason, which is that there's just lots that used to be done by people on assembly lines that can now be done by machines, and there may be blips from one year to the next, but the idea that we were going to have some kind of durable manufacturing renaissance was a chimera when Joe Biden said it, and it's an illusion when Donald Trump says it. And the much more likely thing is that the particular kinds of protection that the Trump administration is stressing are actually going to hurt manufacturing. That does it for us here on \"Wall Street Week.\" I'm David Westin. See you next week for more stories of capitalism.",

        "title": "Summers: 'Self-inflicted Wound' to the US Economy",
        "source": "https://www.bloomberg.com/",
        "content": "00:00\n\nHe should be focused on the fact that we had a shock that pushed inflation up and growth down. And that's a bad supply shock. That's a self-inflicted wound. And it tells us that policy is moving in the wrong direction. And it's a shot against the bow of Trump tariff policies, which clearly have materially changed the picture in a way that the Fed is seeing both as more uncertain and more problematic on both their key objectives. I was struck by the fact that in the projections, the growth projections were taken down not just for 25, but 26 and 27 as well. On the inflation side, it was really mainly in 25 and you heard Chair Powell say maybe the effects are transitory. Using that word we've heard before. I would have thought the chairman would retire the word transitory. That is perhaps the most notorious, the ill chosen phrase of his excellent seven and a half year run as Fed chair. And so I was astonished to see him resurrect that concept. He might turn out to be right, particularly if the economy suffers a recession. It's conceivable that the economy won't suffer a recession, and he'll turn out to be right. But it's certainly not something that I would want to bank on. There's another point that I think most observers have missed, which is if you look at the dot plot, the median, the person in the middle on interest rates has not changed. That's what everybody's highlighted. But the average if you just take an average of everybody's forecast, that's moved up a fair amount in the last few months, reflecting the fact that with these tariffs, with the inflation they're bringing, there's less confidence on the part of the Fed that they're going to be able to cut rates, even as there's a prediction of more cyclical weakness in the economy. So this is clearly a more worrying picture than we had in December. And there's only been one important change, and that's been the change in tariff policy and more broadly, the political approach to economics. One of the themes throughout what Chair Powell had to say was uncertainty, because there's a concern about what is being done. There's also the concern about what we don't know around the corner. We have an enormous uncertainty. What does that do to the economic machinery in and of itself? Nothing good. Look, the task of policy is to reduce uncertainty. The task of policy is to give confidence about sustainability. When policy makers are confidently promising a stock market boom, when they come in and then they deliver the 1011 fastest correction in the last 75 last century, the one of the fastest corrections in the last century. And then they discover that they think the economy needs some kind of detox and they don't give any indication of whether it's going to end. And they vow unprecedented levels of protection to be declared on a date in the future. That is introducing uncertainty, not reducing uncertainty. And I think that's really quite dangerous. I am struck, Larry, that as we talk about what the Federal Open Market Committee that we're talking about, the White House almost exclusively and talk about more broadly what we are seeing coming out of the White House, how it is affecting could affect the economy. For example, this week we had the president say, I'm going to dismiss two sitting FCC commissioners, even though they're an independent agency, a concern that might expand extend into the Federal Reserve. What are the ramifications throughout the government and the economy of the actions we're seeing? Let me speak very directly, David. We are not there yet. But. Every week for the last two months. The risk of an attempt to impose authoritarianism in the United States have gone up. The dismissals that you mention are one example. The lawless cutbacks of spending are another example the impositions and threats to universities with no process. Nothing of what is required in Title six law is another example. The steps with respect to expelling people who are here without the process protections contained in law are another example. The assertion that if the President does it to help the country or save the country it can't be illegal is another example of a flirtation with fascists abroad, such as the AfD in Germany by the vice president is yet another example. And there are many more. We have not crossed the Rubicon yet, where court orders are being defied. That hasn't happened yet, but we are getting much closer to that Rubicon, the so-called Overton Window of things that are seen as possible and imaginable has broadened. And ultimately that is going to be alarming for what America is and therefore potentially going to do grave damage to our economy and the world. We are not there quite yet. But I have to say, what was a possible concern two months ago now seems to me to be a genuinely alarming prospect and that should disturb and worry every investor and our country's leaders in the business and financial community who know how much they have depended on the rule of law, should be organizing to resist what could be a extraordinarily damaging long term change in policy. It takes decades to grow a forest and a few minutes to burn it down. Something like that is true with respect to our nation's credibility and commitment to rule of law. And so I do not remember in the last 50 years a more alarming moment in terms of the approach that the US government is taking to our democratic institutions.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Long-time NBC legal drama Law & Order sparked outrage Wednesday after portraying a character obviously based on accused murderer Luigi Mangione as a folk hero.\n\nMangione was arrested last year in connection with the December murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot and killed in a sneak attack outside the Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe March 20 episode, oh-so-subtly titled “Folk Hero,” starts off with the murder of a prominent CEO who is gunned down on the street by a man in a hoodie wearing a mask — just as Mangione is accused of wearing during the murder of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Newsbusters reported.\n\nIn the episode, Ethan Weller (Ty Molbak) is arrested for the murder of the show’s fictional CEO even as he plans the murder of a second CEO. But soon enough, New Yorkers in the show elevate the accused killer to the status of a local hero.\n\nThe accused killer’s lawyer offers the novel defense that Weller’s crime is justified because he felt he was “saving lives” by killing the insurance company CEO.\n\n“There is no question Ethan Weller shot and killed Logan Andrews,” the lawyer states. “But there’s a reason he did it, a legal reason. He was trying to save lives. Logan Andrews caused the death of thousands of innocent people. By denying their legitimate insurance claims. Thousands more were about to die, are about to die, because of Mr. Andrews’ callous disregard for human life. So Ethan Weller killed Logan Andrews before Mr. Andrews could kill again. And his actions are completely and unequivocally legal under the laws of New York.”\n\nLater in the episode, several CEOs come together and point out that the judge who allowed the absurd defense of the killer has a history of donating to extreme left-wing causes and is attempting to paint all CEOs as mass murderers. Another of the CEOs is outraged, saying, “So now we’re all on trial for this?”\n\n“Yeah, and for what? Because we had the audacity to make money for our shareholders? This judge and this defense lawyer are basically telling the world that it is okay to just hunt us down like–like we’re a bunch of pheasants,” a CEO in the meeting says.\n\nThe show ended on an activist note, as well. Instead of revealing a guilty verdict, the show ended with no verdict at all, leaving the audience the room to decide that murdering a CEO is justified simply because they are rich men who run big companies.\n\nIndeed, Jesse Metcalfe, the actor who portrayed a police officer in the episode, thought the ending was great.\n\n“I feel like this open-ended episode played incredibly well,” Metcalfe told TVInsider. “It really works for this episode. We don’t really take a stand on what the verdict should be. We allow the audience to have their own opinion. I think a lot of times when a storyline isn’t resolved, it can cause the audience a little bit of frustration. I think in this particular episode, I think it’s still incredibly satisfying, which is important.”\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, X at WTHuston, or Truth Social at @WarnerToddHuston.",

        "title": "Trump Signals Support for U.S. Joining Britain's Commonwealth of Nations",
        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has signalled a willingness to see the United States join Britain’s Commonwealth, a voluntary association comprised of mostly former British colonies led by King Charles III.\n\nA report from the top-selling Sun newspaper in Britain claimed that President Trump would be presented with an offer from King Charles during his historic second state visit to the UK to join the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nThe Commonwealth is a network of 56 nations, primarily drawn from former members of the British Empire, which aims to promote “mutually advantageous” relationships between independent nations based on shared heritage and common values.\n\nAt the heart of the group are 15 “Commonwealth Realms,” including the United Kingdom and other nations that still have King Charles as their Head of State, such as the Anglosphere nations of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, which already have close ties with the U.S. through the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network.\n\nResponding to the article from The Sun on Friday evening, President Trump remarked on the reported plans to invite the United States to join the Commonwealth: “I Love King Charles. Sounds good to me!”\n\nThe idea of inviting the United States to join the group was first floated during Trump’s first term in the White House. However, the plans were shelved during the presidency of Joe Biden, who was often described as one of America’s most anti-British presidents in modern history.\n\nOn the other hand, President Trump has been seen as one of the most pro-British presidents, having been an ardent ally of the Brexit independence movement and a staunch supporter of the Royal Family, particularly of Queen Elizabeth II. Trump, whose mother was born on the Scottish Isle of Lewis, is expected to become the first modern U.S. President to have two state visits to Britain after being invited last month by King Charles. The visit is expected to take place next year.\n\nShould the United States join the Commonwealth, it could serve to increase America’s influence in Africa, with 21 of the current 56 member nations coming from the continent.\n\nInfluence in Africa, the home of many resource-rich areas, is widely considered to be of increasing importance in countering the rise of Communist China, which has sought to effectively bribe its way through its Belt and Road debt trap diplomacy scheme to gain control of resources such as rare earth minerals.\n\nJoining the Commonwealth would also likely further solidify the “special relationship” between America and Britain. It might also be a venue through which Washington could negotiate beneficial trading arrangements and serve as a counterbalance to the ongoing trade disputes with the European Union. During his first term, President Trump frequently spoke in support of crafting a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK.\n\nUnlike the globalist project of the EU, which President Trump has long been critical of and recently claimed was created to “screw” the United States, the Commonwealth has no power to infringe upon the sovereignty of member states or impose diktats on nations as Brussels has within the EU.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration may be at odds with some of the Commonwealth’s stated goals, such as supporting the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which President Trump withdrew the United States from in one of his first acts after being inaugurated in January. Unlike Queen Elizabeth, King Charles has long openly expressed his support for the green agenda.\n\nNevertheless, President Trump has often expressed fondness for the British Monarch, previously saying that King Charles is a “really good person”.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump honored the late George Foreman on Saturday, calling the heavyweight legend “something really special.”\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social, Trump wrote, “George Foreman is dead. What a GREAT FIGHTER!!! He had, without question, the heaviest and biggest punch in the history of boxing.”\n\n“With the exception of Ali, when you got hit, you went down. He was something really Special, but above all, he was a Great Person, with a personality that was bigger than life. I knew him well, and he will be missed. Warmest condolences to his wonderful family!!!” he concluded:\n\nForeman’s family announced in a social media post on Friday he had passed away at the age of 76 with his loved ones gathered around him, Breitbart News reported.\n\n“A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great-grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose,” the message read, per Breitbart News:\n\n“A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected — a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name — for his family.” The family added that they “are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.”\n\nIn a post on Saturday, the Trump War Room X account shared an image of the smiling president and Foreman that appeared to have been taken in New York City.\n\n“RIP George Foreman,” its message read:\n\nSocial media users also shared their thoughts on his passing, one person writing, “Two fighters and friends. Fight! Fight! Fight!”\n\n“RIP George Foreman, a spectacular Christian!” someone else commented, while another person said, “True and unforgettable champion. RIP George and condolences to the Foreman family.”\n\nAccording to Fox News, President Trump issued his statement about the loss of his friend just before he is expected to attend the NCAA Division I wrestling championships in Philadelphia.\n\n“Foreman became an Olympic gold medalist in 1968 when he defeated the Soviet Union’s Jonas Čepulis in that year’s Mexico City Olympics, but was most prominently known for his big-ticket matches against fellow legendary boxers Muhammed Ali and Joe Frazier,” the outlet said, later adding that following his incredible boxing career, Foreman became a successful entrepreneur and launched his now famous George Foreman Grill.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP)—Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s book, coming out in September, is being billed by her publisher as an invitation for “readers to see the Supreme Court through the lens of her experience.”\n\n“Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution” will be released Sept. 9, according to Sentinel Books, a conservative imprint of Penguin Random House.\n\n“In ‘Listening to the Law,’ Justice Barrett illuminates her role and daily life as a justice, touching on everything from her deliberation process to dealing with media scrutiny,” Friday’s announcement by Sentinel reads in part. “With the warmth and clarity that made her a popular law professor, she brings to life the making of the Constitution and lays out her approach to interpreting its text, inviting readers to wrestle with questions of originalism and to embrace the rich heritage of the Constitution.”\n\nIn a statement issued through Sentinel, Barrett said, “The process of judging, which happens behind closed doors, can seem like a mystery. It shouldn’t.”\n\nHer signing with Sentinel was first reported in 2021, and financial documents released the following year showed Barrett receiving a $425,000 advance as part of a reported $2 million deal.\n\nOther current justices, including Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and Justice Neil Gorsuch, have published books in recent years.\n\nBarrett, 53, is the youngest member of the court, which she joined in 2020 just weeks after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The third justice appointed by President Donald Trump, Barrett solidified a conservative majority that has overturned abortion rights, broadened religious rights and ended affirmative action in college admissions. Some of Barrett’s decisions have angered conservatives, including a recent case in which she was part of a 5-4 majority that rejected the Trump’s administration’s bid to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid.\n\nBarrett has openly advocated for a spirit of civil debate: She and Sotomayor, one of the court’s liberals, made a handful of joint public appearances i n 2024.\n\n“I don’t think any of us has a ‘my way or the highway’ attitude,” Barrett told a conference of civics educators in Washington.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "President Joe Biden’s open borders policy was “pure evil,” President Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, said.\n\nHe used the strong term after administration officials revealed that another yet catch-and-release migrant has been charged with the murder of an American, Camillia Williams, in Georgia.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security told Fox News:\n\nDavid Hector Rivas-Sagastume, a 21-year-old Honduran national, entered the United States illegally on March 17, 2021, and was arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol. He was issued a notice to appear and paroled into the country by the previous administration. A judge ordered him removed on July 11, 2023. On March 18, 2025, he was arrested by the Cobb County Police Department for capital murder and other crimes. ICE has lodged an immigration detainer with the Cobb County Jail. President Trump and Secretary Noem will not allow criminal illegal aliens—including accused murderers—to be loose on America’s streets.\n\n“Camillia Williams, 52, originally from Louisiana but living in Marietta, was found dead on Pat Mell Road last week,” AJC.com reported. “She’d been strangled at some point between 11 p.m. March 12 and 1 a.m. the next morning.”\n\nGeorgia’s WSBTV.com reported:\n\nThe family said they want justice for Camillia. Her brother Arsene Williams said she was at a store the night before she died and told one of her nieces that a man had been following her. “She called the dude a weirdo and from my understanding, he pretty much waited until he caught her by herself and did what he done,” Arsene Williams said. Williams brothers told Newell that Camillia didn’t know the suspect.\n\nUnder Biden, border chief Alejandro Mayorkas welcomed more than 12 million legal, quasi-legal, and illegal migrants amid strong support from House and Senate Democrats and many progressives.\n\nTheir quasi-legal welcome policy contributed to the deaths of over a thousand migrants in 2022 alone on treks to the U.S. border and hundreds more migrants at job sites. “Fatalities in the private construction industry sector accounted for 37.5 percent (315) of the 839 foreign-born Hispanic or Latino worker deaths in 2023,” the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed in December 2024.\n\nMayorkas’s migrants are also killing a growing number of Americans.\n\nMany more Americans are dying in road accidents caused by reckless, untrained, or incompetent migrant drivers. For example, Freight Waves described a March 13 Texas disaster when a migrant truck driver slammed into the back of a traffic jam:\n\nA man has been arrested as authorities continue to investigate the cause of a crash that killed five people Thursday on Interstate 35 in Austin, Texas. Authorities said 17 vehicles were involved, including a tractor-trailer hauling goods for Amazon, in the accident that happened around 11:30 p.m. in the southbound lanes of I-35. Five people were pronounced dead on the scene, including a child and an infant. Eleven others were taken to hospitals. Solomun Weldekeal Araya, 37, the Dallas-based driver of the tractor-trailer, was arrested Friday by the Austin Police Department and charged with five counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault.\n\nThe damage caused by Biden and Mayorkas goes far beyond thousands of deaths.\n\nBecause of Mayorkas’ welcomes, 300 million blue-collar and white-collar Americans lost power in the labor and housing markets, and they lost much workplace investment, productivity, and training once enabled by employers. For example, many college graduates lost career opportunities because Mayorkas expanded the inflow of white-collar workers, such as H-1B visa workers.\n\nCitizens also lost civic stability to government-imposed social diversity and lost political power to the expanding blocs of ethnic voters who demand benefits for their particular communities, cultures, and home countries.\n\nAmericans also grew disgusted at the Biden government’s migration policy as it spent billions of dollars to extract human resources from poor countries for use in the U.S. economy, regardless of the massive loss of life among migrants and Americans, or the enormous damage to the sending countries.",

They have extremist views about race. They think that boys should compete with girls in sports and children should have their sex reassigned. Until they grapple with that first and then have your argument, the two together will work, but you can’t do this to avoid that.”\n\nKlein responded, “I think they’ve moderated. I think the party has moved on a bunch of those issues. Look, they passed the Laken Riley bill. … The Democrats have moved on this. They didn’t move on it early enough and it’s part of why they lost the election. You’re not wrong on that.”\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

Phil Murphy (D-NJ), and Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-NJ) and revealed that the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) “have been partnering very well together” to address the sinkhole issue.\n\n“This has been a whole of government — local, state, federal response to what’s happening here on I-80,” Duffy explained. “This is a massive artery that can’t be shut down, so everyone is working together to figure out what solution we need to make sure we can open up this roadway again. And, again, it’s an evolving situation. We saw sinkhole one, sinkhole two, now we just saw this sinkhole, so as the situation evolves we’re all assessing where we’re at and what is the best response.”\n\nDuffy continued to note that while he had “committed” to doing “all that we can on the federal side to provide assistance and aide” to the state, there may be “some legislative restrictions” that they may have to address.\n\n“The question will be what federal resources are available. I’ve committed to Congressman Kean and the Governor that we’re going to do all that we can on the federal side to provide assistance and aide to New Jersey,” Duffy continued. “We might have some legislative restrictions, and if that’s the case, we’re going to go to Tom Kean who’s going to drive the Congress to make sure you get the help that you need.”\n\nDuffy’s on-scene visit to the site of the I-80 sinkholes comes as several sinkholes have been reported in the state since December 2024, according to ABC7NY News.\n\nThe first “40-foot by 40-foot” sinkhole was reported to have “opened up in December,” while a second sinkhole “opened up and impacted traffic on the eastbound lanes of I-80 in February,” according to the outlet. The second sinkhole is 75 feet away from the first one. The third sinkhole was reported to have “opened up near Exit 34” while NJDOT was conducting a “drilling operation.”\n\nABC7NY reported, “The site is close to another sinkhole already under repair that opened up and impacted traffic on the eastbound lanes of I-80 in February. A 40-foot by 40-foot sinkhole, which officials said was located just 75 feet away from the February one, opened up in December.”\n\nOfficials explained the sinkholes were caused by abandoned mines that are collapsing, according to the outlet.\n\nDuring the press conference, Murphy revealed that New Jersey Transit would be giving people traveling on the Morris and Essex [train] Line, 50 percent off, as part of an effort to “get as may folks off the roads” and to “alleviate some of the pressure.”\n\n“NJ Transit’s going to allow 50 percent off on the Morris Essex Line beginning Monday to get as many folks off the roads into trains for as long as this is blocked up and hopefully that will alleviate some of the pressure,” Murphy said.\n\nRELATED — WATCH: Massive Sinkhole Opens in San Francisco",

While 51 percent approve, 47 percent disapprove of his performance. The president has not fallen below 50 percent approval during his presidency, according to data dating back to January 23.\n\nThe poll’s margin of error is ± 2.5 percent.\n\nWhile Trump enjoys positive marks from the American public for his performance, Democrats are receiving extremely negative scores on the favorability front.\n\nWATCH — “He’d Be in Trouble” Trump Responds to Tim Walz Saying He Could Kick Most Trump Supporters’ Asses:\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll published last week found that just 29 percent of Americans view the Democrat party favorably. This appears to be the lowest mark for the Democrats in a CNN-affiliated poll since at least 2002. The poll was conducted from March 6-9 among 1,206 U.S. adults, and the margin of error is ± 3.3 percentage points.\n\nIn a March 7-11 NBC News poll, conducted by Hart Strategies and Public Opinion Strategies poll, just 27 percent had positive feelings about the Democrat party. Moreover, only 7 percent said they were “very positive,” while 20 percent said they were “somewhat positive.”\n\nThe survey sampled 1,000 registered voters, and the MOE is ±3.1 percent. Harry Enten, a CNN senior data analyst, said Monday on the outlet’s News Central that this is the worst score for the party “going back on record to 1990 in NBC News polling.”\n\nTrump spoke about the beleaguered state of the Democrat party during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Wednesday in a dining room off of the Oval Office.\n\nWATCH — Astronaut Overtime?

In the coming days, 155 U.S. Marines will head south to train Mexican Navy infantrymen.\n\nThis week, Mexico’s Senate voted unanimously for the joint exercise, which calls for 53 Mexican troops to travel to California for training sessions. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum, who is from the country’s ruling party, MORENA, pushed the move.\n\nInformation by Mexico’s Naval Secretariat (SEMAR) revealed that the joint exercise is called Amphibian Phoenix 2025. In preparation for the exercises, Semar released a series of short videos showing their naval personnel boarding a ship and preparing to sail towards Baja California, where they are expected to meet with U.S. Marines for training.\n\nThe training is expected to begin next week and continue into April. It aims to improve Mexican military forces’ capabilities in amphibian operations.\n\nIn the past, Sheinbaum and her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, previously pushed against the U.S. government’s involvement in Mexican military and law enforcement measures. However, since the arrival of the Trump administration and its hard stance against drug cartels, Mexico’s government has been slowly working to appease Trump and his threats of tariffs. As reported by Breitbart Texas, Trump threatened Mexico with a series of punitive tariffs over what the White House calls an intolerable relationship between drug cartels and Mexico’s government.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with the Breitbart News Foundation.

        "title": "Exclusive — Steven Hantler: Michigan Needs Mike Cox for Governor",
        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Michigan is a key battleground for 2028, and the fight starts now.\n\nThe key to winning in 2028 is being smart about who to support for the governor’s seat in 2026.\n\nMany names are being thrown around, but the need to keep Republican control of the House and Senate for President Trump in 2027 and 2028 (and for the MAGA movement as a whole beyond 2028) limits the pool for governor.\n\nSo, let me suggest someone who grew up the son of a carpenter and domestic maid in a working-class neighborhood, and—like JD Vance—enlisted in the Marine Corps. From there, he became a homicide prosecutor in Detroit and then won statewide office as a pre-Trump tea party populist and working-class warrior.\n\nFormer Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox is looking at running, and he fits the bill of what the Republican Party needs in 2026. He won the closest statewide race in at least 50 years when he defeated Gary Peters by 5,200 votes–a razor-thin, 0.17 percent margin that was even more of a squeaker than when President Trump won Michigan in 2016 by 10,700 votes and a 0.23 percent margin. Mike won despite the top of the ticket in Michigan losing, and he beat retiring U.S. Senator Gary Peters in that race—handing Peters the only general election loss he’s ever had. (Full disclosure: I helped Mike in that race). In 2006, Cox again won by nine percent, despite Republicans losing the Governor’s and Senate races by large margins.\n\nAs attorney general, he refused to use his office to defend the University of Michigan when Jennifer Gratz, a white woman from a working-class suburb of Detroit, sued the university over its affirmative action admissions policies. After Gratz won in the United States Supreme Court, Cox supported Gratz’s and Ward Connerly’s effort to enact a Michigan constitutional amendment banning affirmative action in university admissions, public employment, and public contracting. Cox was one of the very few Republicans to vocally support what was called the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative (MCRI). The voters of Michigan amended the Michigan constitution by enacting MCRI by a 58 to 42 percent margin, despite MCRI being massively outspent. Cox then led the fight to defend MCRI in federal court. Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the validity of MCRI in 2014.\n\nIn 2007, after learning the State of Michigan was issuing driver’s licenses to illegal aliens and other non-residents, Cox again fought the status quo by issuing an attorney general’s opinion to prohibit Michigan from providing driver’s licenses to illegal aliens. Just this past December in a lame duck session, Michigan Democrats tried to overturn Cox’s opinion with legislation, but that effort fell apart.\n\nIn 2010, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer tried to stem the tide of illegal aliens by signing the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act (Arizona SB 1070), which, among other things, required local police to verify the legal status of all arrested or detained persons. When the Obama administration sued Arizona and Arizona’s Democrat Attorney General Terry Goddard refused to defend Arizona in court, Cox led other conservative state attorney generals to file a brief in support of Gov. Brewer and the people of Arizona.\n\nCox ran the Attorney General’s Office with a DOGE-like efficiency, cost-cutting and increasing performance for the benefit of Michigan taxpayers. He reduced the size of his office by over 20 percent while handling more cases and advocating for consumers, crime victims, and children who had gone without child support\n\nIn 2010, Cox was a tea party candidate in the Republican gubernatorial primary where he lost to moderate Rick Snyder when he and three other conservatives divided up the conservative primary vote.\n\nSince that time, Cox has been out of office for over a decade—and that’s a good thing. He is not a career politician or career candidate. After his public service, Cox started his own law firm and built a successful business taking up Republican causes and defending victims of overreaching big government and predators protected by institutions. For instance, in 2020, he successfully represented the Unlock Michigan committee, which sought by citizens’ initiative to strip Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s emergency powers that kept Michigan shut down during COVID longer than most states, and shut down 32 percent of all Michigan businesses–the highest of all the states. Ultimately, in a different case, the Michigan Supreme Court found Whitmer’s asserted powers to be unconstitutional. This past November, the RNC hired Cox to represent it in federal court to defend President Trump and the Republican ticket over any election day integrity issues, which fortunately did not materialize. As a private lawyer, Cox is well known in Michigan and in the sports world as one of the three court-appointed lead counsel for 60 lawyers and 1,000+ former University of Michigan athletes who sued the University for the widespread, decades-long cover up of a predator team physician who sexually abused over a thousand athletes and students between 1965 and 1995 during medical treatment.\n\nCox is now exploring retiring from his private practice to run for governor and has already contributed $1,000,000 to his exploratory committee. He has stated that he wants to demonstrate he has skin in the game before he asks for a single vote, volunteer hour, or donation. If he runs again, Michigan would be on track to be “Great Again” under a populist Republican with a working-class agenda of eliminating the tax on work, enhancing public safety, and fixing Michigan’s failing public school system.\n\nFor Michigan’s sake, I hope he runs.\n\nSteven Hantler was the political advisor to Bernie Marcus and is a retired auto-executive and father to two wonderful children.",

        "content": "On Thursday’s broadcast of “NewsNation Now,” John Sandweg, who served as acting ICE Director under President Obama, stated that the Trump administration is pursuing self-deportation and has caused some illegal immigrants to decide to leave the country voluntarily while they can.\n\nSandweg said, “Look, I think we’re going to find here is that the outcomes, maybe this year are not so dramatically different, certainly, let’s say, you compare it to the Obama years. I don’t think it’s fair to compare it to the Biden years, because, until the last six months of the Biden administration, we had a completely different border, we had hundreds of thousands of people come across and making asylum claims, that bogs down ICE and their internal operations.”\n\nHe added that the major difference between Trump and Obama is Trump is “trying to do, really, not just a mass deportation, but a self-deportation. I think you’ve seen that in the rhetoric. They’ve really shifted to overtly discussing that, and they’re not — what they’re trying to do is by taking part of the guardrails off, is create a climate of fear where more people are going to self-deport.”\n\nSandweg concluded, “What we don’t know yet is what impact this has had on the population that lived here. They’re now looking at this saying, hey, I’m scared now living in the U.S. I might end up in an El Salvadoran prison. I might be detained or deported. I’m just going to leave voluntarily while I can.”\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

        "content": "California Cryobank, the largest sperm bank in the United States, has revealed that it suffered a data breach exposing the private details of its customers. The company has not yet disclosed if donor information was also compromised in the breach.\n\nBleeping Computer reports that California Cryobank, a full-service sperm bank that provides frozen donor sperm and specialized reproductive services to all 50 states and more than 30 countries worldwide, has announced that it experienced a data breach after detecting suspicious activity on its network last year. The company immediately isolated the affected computers from the IT network to contain the incident.\n\nAccording to California Cryobank’s data breach notification, an unauthorized party gained access to their IT environment between April 20, 2024, and April 22, 2024, potentially accessing and/or acquiring files maintained on certain computer systems. As a precautionary measure, the company conducted a comprehensive search and review of the files that may have been compromised during the incident.\n\nThe nearly year-long investigation revealed that the attack exposed varying amounts of personal data belonging to California Cryobank’s customers. The compromised information included names, bank account and routing numbers, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, payment card numbers, and/or health insurance information. In response to the breach, California Cryobank is offering complimentary one-year credit monitoring services to individuals whose Social Security or driver’s license numbers were exposed.\n\nTo enhance its security posture, California Cryobank has implemented additional safeguards and security measures aimed at protecting data and monitoring their systems. However, the company has not yet disclosed whether donor information, such as donor ID numbers, was compromised in the breach. This has raised significant privacy concerns for individuals who have donated sperm anonymously in the past, as donor ID numbers are typically shared with customers and can be used by their offspring to learn more about their biological father when they turn 18.\n\nThe potential exposure of donor information is particularly alarming given the sensitive nature of sperm donation and the expectation of anonymity. Many donors choose to remain anonymous to protect their privacy and avoid potential legal or emotional complications that may arise from being identified. If donor ID numbers were indeed stolen during the breach, it could have far-reaching consequences for both donors and their offspring.\n\nAs of now, California Cryobank has not responded to inquiries regarding the exposure of donor data. The lack of transparency surrounding this aspect of the breach has left many individuals feeling uneasy and concerned about the security of their personal information.\n\nRead more at Bleeping Computer here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "The Disney Grooming Syndicate’s woke remake of Snow White is already shaping up to be a box office bomb.\n\nThis dreadful bastardization of Walt Disney’s 1937 masterpiece starring Rachel Zegler opened on 4,200 screens this weekend, cost $270 million to produce, around another $100 million to promote, and will only open to about $45 million.\n\nFor context, Tim Burton’s live-action remake of Dumbo opened to $46 million in 2019 and went on to gross $115 million domestic and $353 million worldwide. It cost $100 million less than Snow White and is not only considered a box office bomb but is, so far, the lowest grosser from this round of Disney live-action remakes.\n\nAlso bombing this weekend is The Alto Knights, the fifth movie pairing director Barry Levinson and star Robert De Niro. This poorly reviewed gangster drama where, for some reason, De Niro plays both main characters, was released in 2,651 theaters and will only gross around $3 million.\n\nBad day for Trump-haters Zegler and De Niro.\n\nTee hee.\n\nThe Alto Knights is done. Toast. Finito. Over and out.\n\nWe won’t know the true fate of Snow Woke until next weekend. Mufasa: The Lion King opened to an awful $35 million in December but went on to gross $253 million domestic and a respectable $717 million global. Granted, that was during the holidays, but Snow White has no real competition until Minecraft hits theaters in two weeks. Children’s movies frequently hold in there and surprise us.\n\nHowever, word of mouth does not appear to be so hot for Snow White. The current IMDB rating from everyday people who claim to have seen the movie is 2.4 out of ten after 16,000 votes.\n\nSnow White earned a B+ from CinemaScore, which is only okay. Back in 2019, Dumbo earned an A-. Rotten Tomatoes scores the Snow White remake as 44 percent rotten. Viewers, however, gave the movie a 71 percent fresh score. Six years ago, Dumbo earned a 46 percent rotten score from critics and a 47 percent rotten score from moviegoers.\n\nSnow White’s best hope is little girls. Those under the age of 12 gave the movie five stars. Among all those polled who have seen it, Snow White earned only three stars and a terrible “definite recommend” score of just 39 percent.\n\nIf your kids force you to see Snow White, here is the best advice I could offer in my review:\n\nIf you must see this movie, the good news is that there’s no gay stuff, and I suggest you leave right after the poisoned apple drops Snow White dead. That way you at least get a satisfying ending.\n\nHey, I’m here to help.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nWhile delivering speeches on Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez told listeners, “We need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us too,” Fox News reported.\n\nIn response, Fetterman shared a screenshot of an Axios story highlighting her comments, then added his own statement.\n\n“Fight ‘harder’—a stunt that would have harmed millions and plunged us into chaos. We kept our government open. Deal with it,” he wrote:\n\nSocial media users shared their reactions to her statement and his response, one person writing, “To be honest, you can fight as hard as you want but you will never outrun the debt and waste. Immediate, decisive action has to be taken to correct course.”\n\n“I’m in PA, if Fetterman walks away from the corrupt Dem party I will vote for him next time,” someone else commented, while another person said, “The Democrats fight harder to ruin our country. They only enrich themselves.”\n\nThe Fox report noted that Fetterman and some of his fellow Democrats recently voted to “overcome a procedural hurdle, which cleared the way for the chamber to vote on a government funding measure to avoid a partial government shutdown.”\n\n“Nine Democrats and one Independent joined with Republicans to end debate and proceed to a final vote on the continuing resolution (CR) to avert a shutdown,” Breitbart News’s Bradley Jaye reported.\n\nFollowing the cloture vote, Fetterman and many other Democrats voted against passing the funding measure that eventually did pass, Fox said, adding that “Ocasio-Cortez had urged senators to vote against cloture and against the measure.”\n\nA recent CNN poll showed that Ocasio-Cortez was found to “best reflect the core values” of the Democrat Party, Breitbart News reported on Monday.\n\nThe outlet said, “The CNN poll also revealed the Democrat party’s favorability among Americans has reached a ‘record low’ of 29 percent, ‘fueled in part by dimming views from its own frustrated supporters.'”\n\nIn January, then President-elect Donald Trump called Fetterman a “commonsense person” after the two met at his Mar-a-Lago home, per Breitbart News.\n\n“He’s not liberal or conservative. He’s just a commonsense person, which is beautiful,” Trump stated.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Kansas City Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann recently filed a lawsuit against a satanic group for allegedly stealing a Holy Eucharist to use in a “black mass” – a claim that the group denied under oath.\n\nThe Catholic Church regards a consecrated Eucharist as the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Jesus Christ while retaining the appearance of bread and wine – a theological concept known as transubstantiation. Earlier this month, the archbishop “filed a petition to recover the Eucharist—under state laws governing the return of wrongfully taken or held personal property—in the civil division of the District Court of Leavenworth County, Kansas,” per the Catholic Register.\n\nAccording to the article:\n\nThe motion names the defendants as Michael T. Stewart and Travis L. Roberts, along with The Grotto Society (also known as The Satanic Grotto), described in the document as a Kansas not-for-profit corporation. Stewart and Roberts are the president and vice president of the society, a Satanic organization that plans to conduct a “black mass” March 28 on the grounds of the Kansas Statehouse in Topeka. The motion cites posts made earlier this month by Stewart on the social media platform Reddit in which Stewart—using the handle “xsimon666x” and describing himself as “Simon Satanas”—wrote that his group “already secured a consecrated host [Eucharist]” and “wine too” for desecration at the planned March 28 event.\n\nIn another post on March 7, Stewart’s handle also wrote on Reddit that the desecration of the Eucharist would be used to “manifest the link between Satan and the capital [sic] building.”\n\n“God will fall and Kansas will be embraced by the black flame of Lucifer,” said a Facebook page for the “black mass.”\n\nIn his petition to the court, the archbishop stated that the Catholic Church “maintains ownership of all Consecrated Hosts [Eucharists] and Wine throughout the world,” adding that the “value of Consecrated Hosts and Wine is incalculable because their significance and importance cannot be measured monetarily.”\n\n“In addition, there is a special need for very prompt action due to the immediate danger that Defendants, consistent with the intent of a ‘Black Mass’ and their statements made to date, will desecrate, conceal, or otherwise damage the property at issue,” the petition said.\n\nCatholics in the diocese were partially put at ease when the satanic group’s leader stated under oath that they did not possess a consecrated Eucharist, Catholic Vote reported.\n\n“In a pivotal court development Wednesday, the leader of a group known as the satanic Grotto testified under oath that neither he nor members of his organization possess a validly Consecrated Host, easing a central concern voiced by the Catholic Church ahead of a highly controversial ritual scheduled to take place March 28,” noted the outlet.\n\n“The sworn testimony came just before a civil legal action filed by Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City in Kansas was set to be heard in district court,” according to the report.\n\nThe last-minute avowal assuaged some tension surrounding the dark event, according to Chuck Weber, executive director of the Kansas Catholic Conference.\n\n“We now have a sworn statement before a judge that the group does not possess a validly Consecrated Host,” he said. “This alleviates a major concern.”\n\nPaul Roland Bois directed the award-winning Christian tech thriller, EXEMPLUM, which has a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating and can be viewed for FREE on YouTube, Tubi, or Fawesome TV. “Better than Killers of the Flower Moon,” wrote Mark Judge. “You haven’t seen a story like this before,” wrote Christian Toto.

He studied martial arts and loved playing Dungeons and Dragons.”\n\nThe actor was born in Indiana and moved to California soon after high school to become an actor. He took on guest roles in popular shows such as ER and Felicity.

        "content": "President Trump recently offered a hopeful glimpse into the treatment Catholics can expect in his America when he pledged to investigate the attack on St. Patrick’s Catholic Church in Wichita, Kansas, that left a Satanic website address scrawled on the wall.\n\n“I think it’s a terrible thing,” Trump said, when asked about the attack. “I am going to take a look at it.”\n\nThis promise – in addition to the administration’s new “Anti-Christian Weaponization Task Force,” – have officially put the cowardly extremists responsible for nearly 500 attacks on Catholic Churches across America since 2020 on notice.\n\nIt seems there really is a new sheriff in town in America, one who will not tolerate the persecution of Catholics and the vulnerable, nor the weaponization of government agencies to shield such abhorrent behavior.\n\nDuring the last four years, Catholics suffered from the Biden administration’s hostility towards, and outright harassment of, people of faith. Not only did the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) authorize federal agents to spy on Catholics at their religious services , but the Department of Justice (DOJ) actively persecuted nonviolent pro-life advocates while deliberately ignoring hundreds of violent attacks on pro-life organizations and churches across America.\n\nAs CatholicVote’s tracking of the hundreds of cases of violence against Catholic churches and pro-life organizations continued to grow, even we were amazed at the shameless double standard of justice under Biden’s DOJ and FBI. While non-violent pro-life advocates, including an elderly survivor of a communist death camp, faced serious jail time for peacefully protesting abortion, domestic terrorist groups like Jane’s Revenge publicly promised and then carried out with impunity violence and vandalism against pro-life charities and churches. (The Jane’s Revenge crimes were documented in a six-part series by Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow).\n\nCatholicVote repeatedly appealed to our second Catholic president and his administration to hear our concerns and stop weaponizing government agencies against their political opponents. Repeated letters to the FBI and DOJ, as well as Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the federal agencies, were met with stonewalling or silence. In April 2023, we joined Judicial Watch in filing a lawsuit against the FBI and DOJ demanding that they hand over records related to the targeting of Catholics.\n\nBy the time the 2024 election rolled around, Catholics were fed up. Catholic voters made their voices heard at the ballot box, effecting an historic swing in the Catholic vote towards Trump, resulting in the largest margin of victory among U.S. Catholics in decades.\n\nTrump’s concern over the Wichita Kansas Church attack – and all anti-Christian bias – is part of the reason why he won the support of these Catholic voters.\n\nThis is the hate crime scene at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Wichita. After forcing their way inside, statues were… Posted by Kansas Catholic Conference on Saturday, March 15, 2025\n\nSince assuming office, President Trump has repeatedly sent the message that bigotry, including when it’s directed against Catholics, is unwelcome in America. Trump-appointed Attorney General Pam Bondi has also vowed to end the previous administration’s use of government power to target Christians when they dissented from its left-wing political agenda.\n\nTrump’s FBI director Kash Patel just turned over “key records” related to the Biden administration’s weaponization of the DOJ and FBI to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) for investigation. These documents reportedly include information on the FBI Richmond Field Office’s anti-Catholic memo and the FBI’s one-sided application of the FACE Act in favor of abortion activists.\n\nInitiatives like this will go a long way towards correcting the injustices of the previous administration and cultivate goodwill between Catholics and their leaders in government.\n\nThankfully, local police, aided by the FBI and ATF, have already arrested a suspect in connection with the attack on St. Patrick’s Catholic Church in Wichita, Kansas, which many suspect could have been connected to a blasphemous “black mass” a Satanist group plans to perform at the Kansas state capitol on March 28.\n\nTrump was right; anti-Catholic bigotry is a terrible thing.\n\nIt’s our hope that President Trump’s team takes a thorough look at the Kansas attack as part of the broader, ongoing spate of violence against people of faith which should have no place in our country.\n\nTommy Valentine is the Director of the Catholic Accountability Project at CatholicVote and architect of the CatholicVote Church Attack and Pregnancy Center Attack Trackers.",

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nThe election is between conservative former Wisconsin Attorney General and Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Brad Schimel and Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, Breitbart News reported on March 7.\n\nWhile speaking with the outlet exclusively, conservative activist Scott Presler said, “I tried to warn people in 2023, and here is what I’m saying now: if Wisconsinites don’t pay attention to this race, history is going to repeat itself, and you’re going to have this court stay under Democrat control.”\n\nCrawford has been called an “extreme abortion activist, not an impartial judge” in mailers that were recently sent to Wisconsin voters, according to Breitbart News.\n\nThe outlet’s Katherine Hamilton further detailed the issues at stake:\n\nThe 2025 race follows a blowout Wisconsin Supreme Court election in 2023, in which liberal-leaning Janet Protasiewicz beat conservative candidate Dan Kelly and flipped the balance of the court 4-3 majority liberal. While conservatives have the chance to take back the majority once more with the retirement of liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, Democrats view the battle as a chance to push policy and redraw legislative maps that could ultimately lose Republicans two U.S. House seats and help them close in on the Republicans’ slim majority. Like every election since the Supreme Court overturned the invented federal right to abortion in 2022, Democrats and left-leaning media are largely framing the election as another referendum on abortion. When Roe v. Wade was struck down, Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion restriction went into effect, but was put on hold in December 2023 and is expected to come before the state’s high court later this year.\n\nCrawford’s campaign has received backing from leftist mega donors, including billionaire George Soros, per Breitbart News.\n\n“Crawford is also endorsed by various far-left groups, like the pro-abortion EMILY’s List and Planned Parenthood, as well as sheriffs who have defied ICE,” the report said.\n\nThe outlet noted on March 12 that Trump won the swing state’s 10 electoral votes in November, and “A new Marquette poll shows Wisconsin residents closely divided on Trump with 51 percent disapproving and 48 percent approving.”\n\n“Next month’s election for a seat on the state’s Supreme Court could give a clearer picture of how Wisconsin voters view the president’s first 100 days and may impact whether Trump will continue to have Republican majorities in Washington,” the article read.",

        "content": "Swedish buy now, pay later (BNPL) fintech giant Klarna has landed a significant deal with food delivery service DoorDash, further solidifying its position in the U.S. market as the company gears up for its upcoming IPO. Thanks to the deal, Americans with no financial literacy can now finance their meal delivery purchases.\n\nCNBC reports that Klarna, a leading player in the rapidly growing BNPL industry, announced on Thursday that it has partnered with DoorDash, marking the food delivery company’s first BNPL alliance in the United States. This partnership will provide DoorDash customers with flexible payment options, allowing them to split their purchases into four equal interest-free installments or defer payments to align with their payday schedules. Incredibly, it seems some Americans are enthusiastically embracing the option to go into debt to have food delivered.\n\nThe collaboration between the two companies is expected to boost the fintech company’s presence in the U.S. market, where it has been steadily expanding its reach. Chief Commercial Officer David Sykes emphasized the significance of the partnership, stating, “Our partnership with DoorDash marks an important milestone in Klarna’s expansion into everyday spending categories.”\n\nThis announcement comes on the heels of another major win for Klarna, as it recently became the exclusive provider of BNPL loans for OnePay, a fintech company backed by retail giant Walmart. These high-profile partnerships are expected to strengthen the fintech player’s position as it prepares for its anticipated debut on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe company’s prospectus, filed last week, revealed a 24 percent increase in revenue to $2.8 billion in the previous year, along with an adjusted operating profit of $181 million, a significant turnaround from the $49 million loss it incurred a year earlier.\n\nAs the demand for flexible payment options continues to grow, particularly among younger consumers, Klarna’s partnership with DoorDash is likely to resonate with a wide audience. The convenience of splitting payments or aligning them with payday schedules is expected to attract more customers to the food delivery platform, while simultaneously boosting the European company’s transaction volumes.\n\nRead more at CNBC here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.",

        "source": "https://www.breitbart.com/",
        "content": "Former First Lady Michelle Obama is surprised that her school lunch program proved to be so controversial.\n\nObama made the remarks during an appearance this week on the Not Gonna Lie podcast with Kylie Kelce, asserting that her decision to make a difference with school lunches — and her overall “Let’s Move” initiative — was “strategic” in nature.\n\n“I was trying to be strategic about aligning my agenda with something that was important to the West Wing. And I thought, ‘There’s no way that anyone is going to take issue with trying to make school lunches healthier, getting kids more active,'” she said.\n\nThe wife of former President Barack Obama then appeared to try and take credit for more recent nutrition-related statements made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claiming that she said “the same things” during her school lunch initiative, which launched in 2010.\n\n“Just trying to make the next generation healthier than ours and, boy, was I wrong, which is really interesting in these times with the current Secretary of Health and Human Services [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] who is now saying some of the same things that I was saying,” Obama said.\n\nShe ultimately blamed the controversy on partisan differences. “It became a partisan issue. People were telling me that I’m trying to be the ‘nanny state’ and I’m trying to control what our kids are eating. And telling them what’s good for them and what’s not good for them.”\n\nHowever, the former first lady maintained that her team achieved its goals with her program. She argued that they improved nutrition standards and factors such as “labels so that they were more readable, so that people’s parents could really understand the breakdown of fat and sugar. And it was clear we got the school nutrition standards improved in our schools for the first time in, like, 50 years.”\n\nObama’s school lunch initiative garnered a flood of negative attention. Many students posted photos online of their unappetizing meals after its rules were implemented. President Donald Trump worked to expand the overly restrictive program by bringing items such as chocolate milk back to the table during his first term in 2017.\n\n“Schools need flexibility in menu planning so they can serve nutritious and appealing meals,” Trump’s then secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, said at the time.\n\n“Schools want to offer food that students actually want to eat. It doesn’t do any good to serve nutritious meals if they wind up in the trash can,” he added.\n\nIn 2020, the first Trump administration went beyond chocolate milk to announce a comprehensive rollback of the Obama-era school lunch standards.\n\n“Schools and school districts continue to tell us that there is still too much food waste and that more common-sense flexibility is needed to provide students nutritious and appetizing meals,” Perdue stated. “We listened and now we’re getting to work.”",

One appeared to be barely conscious during the hearing.\n\nAccording to Petrenko, 19 people are currently in custody in Russia in relation to the attack on Moscow’s Crocus City Hall.\n\nA faction of the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the massacre in which gunmen shot people who were waiting for a show by a popular rock band and then set the building on fire. But Russian officials including President Vladimir Putin have persistently claimed, without presenting evidence, that Ukraine had a role in the attack. Kyiv has vehemently denied any involvement.",

And I don’t hear Democrats trying to grab some high ground here and say, who’s doing this? Who’s doing this? This is not America. You don’t burn up people’s property like this. These are acts of terror, what they’re doing to these Teslas. I don’t hear your guys saying it. Why?”\n\nRaskin responded, “Well, number one, let me say it right now, and I absolutely deplore and oppose any act of violence against human beings, like we saw on January 6, with the massive violence leveled against our police officers. And I’m opposed to burning other people’s property. That’s against the law. And this is the kind of civil disorder that has been unleashed in the country and licensed by Donald Trump, who pardoned more than 1,500 insurrectionists, including hundreds of people who violently assaulted our police officers. So, that scene you’re showing me [of burning Teslas] makes me sick, not as sick as the attack on our police officers, but it’s in the same domain, and it’s all because of the same reason.”\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

        "content": "During the online “Overtime” segment of Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” writer Andrew Sullivan said that former NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci lied to cover up the possibility that COVID leaked from a lab because “you don’t want to go down in history as the person who helped develop the virus that killed millions of people. You want to go down as the one who saved millions of people.”\n\nSullivan responded to a question on reports that British intelligence knew that the lab leak theory was correct by stating that German intelligence also knew.\n\nHe added, “[T]he core paper that killed off any idea that this was a lab leak in China, the Proximal Origin paper, which was produced with Fauci and Collins of the NIH and NIAID helping it along was a lie, a conscious lie. The people who looked at it, we now have their emails, are saying in the very first days of looking at the virus, this looks very man-made to us.”\n\nSullivan further said, “The question is why? Why would they lie to us about that? And they did.”\n\nSullivan further stated, “This lab was a gain-of-function lab…this gain-of-function research was always dangerous. Everyone knew it was dangerous, a long time ago. … Do you know who was the biggest supporter of gain-of-function research for the last 30 years? Anthony Fauci. … There’s a reason he was given a pardon back to 2014. There is something very wrong going on here.”\n\nSullivan added that he doesn’t think Fauci was trying to make himself rich, but “he knew, from the get-go, that the Wuhan lab had security levels that were the average of a dentist’s office. They should have been at the highest level imaginable. He knew that. Not only that, NIH and NIAID had helped fund it. So, you don’t want to go down in history as the person who helped develop the virus that killed millions of people. You want to go down as the one who saved millions of people. That was at stake, a reputational matter.”\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

        "content": "Kitty Dukakis, the wife of 1988 Democrat presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, died on Friday at the age of 88, according to her family.\n\nHer son, John Dukakis, confirmed his mother’s passing, attributing it to complications stemming from dementia.\n\nShe served as the first lady of Massachusetts when her husband was governor from 1975 to 1979. In 1988, Michael Dukakis became the Democrat nominee for president.\n\n“Kitty Dukakis used her role as First Lady of the Commonwealth to champion refugees and the homeless, promote greater awareness of the Holocaust, and advocate for placing more women in leadership roles within state government,” the Massachusetts Democratic Party said in a statement.\n\n“Yet, it was her courage in publicly sharing her struggles with depression and substance use disorder that truly defined her strength,” it continued.\n\n“Her honesty and bravery helped break down stigma, inspiring countless others to seek support and begin their own journeys of recovery,” the Democrat Party of Massachusetts added.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post:\n\nAs first lady of Massachusetts, Mrs. Dukakis described herself as driven by “compassion and humanitarian concern.” She said she was “fiercely proud” of her Jewish background — her husband was Greek Orthodox — and played a role in the creation of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. Her intense personality, chain smoking and preference for first-class travel and designer clothes both complemented and provided a contrast to her husband’s straight-arrow persona. Calm, button-down and abstemious, he nursed a frugality that extended to flying coach and mowing his own lawn as governor. (Massachusetts does not have an official residence for its governor.)\n\n“Kitty had courage. She used her personal pain as a powerful force to help others. Her legacy will live on in the policies she helped shape and the people she inspired to speak their own truths,” Massachusetts Attorney General Joy Campbell said in reaction to Dukakis’s passing.\n\n“My thoughts, prayers and love are with Michael and the entire Dukakis family,” she added.",

        "content": "South Carolina State Sen. Matt Leber (R) is continuing his fight to obligate local officials to follow the existing law and swear an oath to the United States Constitution after county council members reversed their decision to do so, telling Breitbart News that this is “the cutting edge of the culture wars at this point.”\n\nJoining Breitbart News Saturday with Washington bureau chief Matt Boyle, Leber spoke on how he is escalating the legislative battle to make the Charleston County Public Library’s Board of Trustees uphold the Constitution.\n\n“I called as many senators I could get on the phone on the weekend, which is sort of difficult sometimes, but 14 signed a letter with me stating that there was not going to be any new legislation coming. The law suffices. The only new legislation we were going to do is we were going to double down on the penalties and have trigger mechanisms that come into effect immediately. If you do not take the oath, you lose your job that second. And if the county doesn’t remove them, then the county loses their state funding until they do remove them. So the fight goes on. The fight goes on.”\n\nIn an episode of Breitbart News Saturday earlier in March, Leber reported that he verified with South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson that the state’s constitution requires public officials to take the oath, a law that the few conservative members of the board wanted to follow.\n\n“I requested an opinion from the South Carolina Attorney General. He said, ‘Oh, it’s definitely in the law. These folks have to swear an oath to the Constitution.’ And I started to insist on that, and as you can imagine, it just devolved from there,” the state senator said.\n\nThe Charleston County Council has gone back and forth on the issue, switching their votes from no, to yes, to no again on Thursday.\n\nThe next vote will occur next Tuesday to solidify that decision.\n\nCouncilman Brantley Moody (R) told WCBD he agrees with enforcing the oath policy, but needs guidance from state legislators on how to implement it:\n\nWe learned through the last week and a half, that our clerk has been spending 24 hours a day trying to do the state’s work, trying to figure out how to implement this policy of taking the oath, which we all support. Our position tonight is we need to have the general assembly and folks in Columbia give direction to all 46 counties. Charleston County should not be writing legislation for the entire. Everybody up there is in favor of taking the oath; we just need to know how to do it.\n\nLeber stated that eight of the 11 members of the library board have refused to pledge to uphold the Constitution, prompting him to call for their termination:\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the problem is much deeper than the library board:\n\nI mean, think of it this way. If you have someone that says ‘I cannot swear an oath to this Constitution because it’s not always favored me’ — That person is a trustee of the library. What’s the chance that they’re actually going to vote for a book that praises the Constitution or talks about founding fathers? That’s – no, they’re never going to support those books. So it’s bigger. It’s bigger than just not taking the oath. But they have taught these people for decades to hate America, to hate our founding fathers, to hate our sacred documents, and then when they get into power, this is how they’re going to use that education of hating America, and I’m calling them out. This is bigger than just not taking the oath. This is the cutting edge of the culture wars at this point.\n\nThe battle is certainly not over, he added.\n\n“We’re going to fight this all the way through, and they are going to be forced to either take the oath or not,” Leber said. “And I think the left is most fearful that they’re going to have hundreds of people throughout the state that are going to say no to the oath. It’s a great reform.”\n\nBreitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.",

A total of 532,000 migrants entered the U.S. under that policy, which was paused soon after President Trump took office, though it’s unclear how many have been able to secure another status that will allow them to stay in the country legally.\n\nIn a notice, it was revealed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would be “terminating the categorical parole programs for inadmissible aliens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela and their immediate family members”:\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) is terminating the categorical parole programs for inadmissible aliens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela and their immediate family members (hereinafter referred to as “CHNV parole programs”) that DHS announced in 2022 and 2023. This Federal Register notice is intended to provide context and guidance to the public regarding the termination of the CHNV parole programs and related employment authorization.\n\nBreitbart News’s Hannah Knudsen reported in February that CBS News learned through “internal government documents reviewed,” that the Trump administration was planning to revoke the legal status for thousands of migrants admitted into the country under the Biden administration.\n\nA report released by the House Judiciary Committee in early March showed that former President Joe Biden expanded the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, as well as the CHNV Parole Program. Through his expansion of the programs, millions of illegal aliens were allowed to enter the U.S. “with little to no vetting.”\n\nIn August 2024, Fox News reported that DHS under the Biden administration had decided to halt the “issuing of advance travel authorization” for the CHNV Parole Program, “out of an abundance of caution.”\n\nThe freeze of the program at the time came “after an internal report” found there were “large amounts of fraud in applications for” people wanting to sponsor migrants in the program, according to the outlet.",

        "content": "Fifty-one percent of Democrats and 73 percent of liberals oppose the deportation of a Hamas-boosting Arab migrant who led anti-Israel protests at Columbia University in New York, according to a poll by Rasmussen Reports.\n\nThe poll spotlights the Democratic Party’s risky entanglement in radical, anti-Jewish identity politics, much of which was imported by the party’s pro-migration laws and politicians.\n\nIn mid-March, Rasmussen asked 1,219 likely voters:\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a student from Syria who led anti-Israel protests at Columbia University, has been detained by federal immigration authorities who plan to deport him. Should Mahmoud Khalil be deported?\n\nOverall, 45 percent support the detention and 37 oppose the detention. Eighteen percent said they were not sure.\n\nModerates split 36 percent yes, 41 percent no.\n\nSeventy-three percent of conservatives and 67 percent of Republicans support the detention.\n\nKhalil, who is not a citizen, began protesting Israel’s counter-offensive less than a week after Hamas launched its bloody and chaotic cross-border October 7 raid. The raiding Hamas gunmen yelled Islamic slogans as they killed roughly 1,000 Jewish civilians, including many young people at an early-morning rave.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration is deporting migrants who believe in “hateful ideologies,” even if they do not break laws. Khalil’s supporters say he should not be deported because his pro-Hamas advocacy is protected by free speech.\n\nA second question by Rasmussen framed the Khalil issues around free-speech rights, asking: “Which is closer to your opinion, that Mahmoud Khalil was exercising his free speech rights, or that he was supporting the terrorist organization Hamas?”\n\nForty-three percent picked “free speech,” while 40 percent picked “supporting the terrorist organization Hamas?”\n\nSeventy-six percent of liberals picked the speech option, as did 46 percent of moderates.\n\nAmid the partisan divide on migration policy, polls show divided opinion over the proper balance of power between the Presidency and the courts. Democrats say progressive judges must block Trump’s policies, while Republicans expect the Supreme Court to override the lower-court judges.\n\nSince 2021, President Joe Biden’s deputies used a variety of legally questionable policies to jump the foreign-born population past 50 million, or one-six residents of the United States.\n\nThe migrants’ arrival, and the resulting chaotic diversity, have imposed huge pocketbook and civic burdens on ordinary Americans, even as they also expanded the economy, aided major Wall Street investors, and expanded the flow of taxes to government officials.\n\nBut the diversity has also hit Democrats, including the leading Democrat in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nHe has been a determined advocate for more migration. “The one thing I’d really like to do is immigration reform. If that [2013 “Gang of Eight”] bill had passed, the country would be a different place,” Schumer said in June 2023.\n\nBut this year, the Democrats’ splits over might helped cause him to cancel a book tour for his new book, Antisemitism in America: A Warning.\n\nLeft-wing antisemitism is “much harder to grapple with than antisemitism on the right,” Schumer wrote in his book, according to an article in Forward.com, which explained, “because it often comes from political allies and because it can masquerade as human rights activism.”",

They really did get ideologically out of control.” But President Donald Trump is an “extortionist” and higher education as a whole has to say, “no more deals.” And “there will be a time where everybody has to hold together and stand up and say, no, no more deals.”\n\nBrooks said, “In the case of Columbia, I personally think the Trump requests or demands, whatever it is, are kind of reasonable, and Columbia should have done all of this stuff five or ten years ago. They really did get ideologically out of control. And if they are publicly-funded — partially publicly-funded, then you’ve got a problem. And they created this problem.

        "content": "It helps to know the timely dos and don'ts of credit card debt forgiveness before getting started. Getty Images\n\nHopes that the Federal Reserve would resume its interest rate cut campaign, while dim, were eliminated this week after the bank continued to keep its federal funds rate on pause. And while that inaction was largely anticipated, it did little to help borrowers currently saddled with high interest rates on a variety of products. While a cut to that rate would have done little to alleviate the burden being felt by credit card holders, in particular, since rates there are determined largely by the prime rate, it could have at least been a small step in the right direction. Now credit card holders will have to explore alternative ways to tackle their high-rate debt, if they haven't already.\n\nFortunately, there are multiple debt relief options to consider, with credit card debt forgiveness being one of the most dramatic and easy to understand. But credit card debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, shouldn't be approached in a cavalier manner, either, as it can have long-term credit score implications, impacting your ability to borrow money again in the future. In today's unique economic climate, specifically, there are some important credit card debt forgiveness dos and don'ts that borrowers should consider. Below, we'll detail four of them.\n\nLearn how to qualify for credit card debt forgiveness here now.\n\nCredit card debt forgiveness dos and don'ts to know in 2025\n\nDon't just rush to get started with credit card debt forgiveness, particularly if it's not clear that it will offer the relief you may need now. Instead, start by reviewing these four timely dos and don'ts:\n\nDo: Understand the eligibility criteria\n\nNot everyone will qualify for credit card debt forgiveness. You'll typically need at least $7,500 in outstanding credit card debt, a financial hardship you can clearly document showing inability to repay and already be behind on payments. Additional eligibility criteria may apply depending on the debt relief servicer. So, understand the exact qualifications before applying. If you don't closely meet all three, you may find it more effective and less time-consuming to explore alternatives, particularly now knowing that significant interest rate relief has again been pushed off.\n\nExplore your top debt relief options online today.\n\nDon't: Ignore alternatives\n\nCredit card debt forgiveness is understandably considered a top debt relief option thanks to its ability to potentially eliminate up to 50% of your existing credit card debt. But it's not the only option, and possibly not even the most applicable one to consider now. Debt management programs can be particularly helpful for those struggling with their monthly credit card payments.\n\nA debt consolidation loan or debt consolidation program can get your credit card paid off at a potentially much lower interest rate, saving you both time and money. On the other end of the spectrum, bankruptcy could be the most effective way to finally eliminate your credit card debt, even if means a long-term impact on your credit score. You won't know which is optimal, however, until you've closely inspected and compared all alternatives.\n\nDo: Understand the timeline\n\nIf you've met the credit card debt forgiveness eligibility requirements and have determined that this is the top relief option for your needs now, then you're two steps closer to having your credit card debt forgiven. But those are just two steps in what is likely to be a multiple-year journey as most credit card debt forgiveness programs erase a portion of your debt within two to four years. And that's on the assumption that you don't grow your debt further during that time frame. Understanding this timeline is critical, however, as it gives you something to compare against versus waiting for the economic climate to improve and taking a do-it-yourself approach.\n\nDon't: Wait to tackle your debt any longer\n\nUltimately, whatever debt relief course you choose, it's important not to delay action any further. Delaying tackling your debt comes with serious repercussions that could have long-lasting impacts on your financial health. And, in the economic climate of March 2025, with interest rates still elevated, inflation sticky and stock market uncertainty prominent, waiting for a perfect solution to a growing problem doesn't make sense. Whether it's credit card debt forgiveness, debt consolidation loans or some other option (or a combination of multiple ones), what's important is taking action now.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nTo make any debt relief strategy work, those suffering from excessive debt should first familiarize themselves with the dos and don'ts of each unique approach. By being aware of the credit card debt forgiveness dos and don'ts of early 2025, cardholders can determine if this is the right move for them and, if it is, they can then use this knowledge to develop an enduring and ultimately successful debt relief technique. But the work should start now, before additional debt accrues and compound interest makes it even harder to pay down what you already owe.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nPursuing debt forgiveness this March could help you save hefty amounts on your credit card debt. Getty Images\n\nOver the past few years, high inflation and the elevated cost of living that comes with it have made it increasingly difficult for many Americans to stay on top of their finances. With everyday essentials like groceries and gas becoming more expensive, some consumers have had to rely on credit cards just to cover basic expenses. As a result, total U.S. credit card debt soared to a record $1.21 trillion by the end of 2024.\n\nThe financial strain caused by those issues is now evident. Credit card delinquencies have been rising, signaling that more households are struggling to make even the minimum payments on their accounts. Once missed payments start adding up, this type of high-rate debt can quickly spiral out of control, making it nearly impossible to pay off balances in a reasonable time frame. For example, at today's rates, it could take years to pay off a $10,000 balance, even with regular monthly payments.\n\nFor those overwhelmed by debt, credit card debt forgiveness could offer a path to relief. But how much could it actually save someone with a $10,000 balance this March? Let's break it down.\n\nStart on a path to credit card debt forgiveness today.\n\nHow much would debt forgiveness save you on $10,000 in credit card debt this March?\n\nCredit card debt forgiveness refers to the process of settling a debt with your creditors for less than what's owed by negotiating with them directly or using a debt relief company to negotiate with your creditors.\n\nIf you work with a debt relief company, the experts at the company will work with you to create a repayment plan based on your income and expenses. Once the payment plan is created, you'll make monthly payments to your debt relief service and will stop making payments to your credit card issuers. The money from your monthly payments is then held in a special savings account until you have enough funds to settle what you owe.\n\nAfter enough has been saved in the account, the debt relief company will begin negotiations with your credit card issuers, offering settlement amounts that are less than what you owe currently. If these negotiations are successful, a lump-sum payment is made and the remaining balance is forgiven.\n\nGenerally speaking, debt forgiveness reduces your balance by 30% to 50% on average. As such, the process can be a financial lifesaver for some borrowers. For example, here's what your debt forgiveness would look like on a $10,000 balance if a settlement reduced your balance by 30%, 40% or 50%:\n\n30% settlement on $10,000 in credit card debt: $7,000 paid, $3,000 forgiven\n\n$7,000 paid, $3,000 forgiven 40% settlement on $10,000 in credit card debt : $6,000 paid, $4,000 forgiven\n\n$6,000 paid, $4,000 forgiven 50% settlement on $10,000 in credit card debt: $5,000 paid, $5,000 forgiven\n\nAnd, to compare, here's what it would cost you to pay off a credit card with a $10,000 balance on a credit card with a 20.09% APR if you were making a monthly payment of $200 instead:\n\nStarting balance: $10,000\n\n$10,000 Time to payoff: 9 years, 2 months\n\n9 years, 2 months Total interest paid: $11,857\n\n$11,857 Total paid: $21,857\n\nAs illustrated above, it would take you more than nine years and cost you more than $11,800 in interest to pay down a $10,000 credit card balance if you were making minimum monthly payments of $200.\n\nWhile the savings that credit card debt forgiveness offers can be substantial, there are some trade-offs. For starters, because you stop making payments on the debt you're trying to settle, your credit score may drop initially depending on where you started. Debt relief companies also typically charge between 15% to 25% of the settled amount for their services, and you could owe taxes on the forgiven portion of your debt, as the IRS considers it to be income.\n\nGet started and tackle your high-rate credit card debt now.\n\nWho qualifies for credit card debt forgiveness this March?\n\nGenerally speaking, to qualify for debt forgiveness, you typically need to have at least $5,000 to $10,000 in unsecured debt and prove that you're facing a financial hardship that makes it hard for you to pay down your debt. Hardships that might help you qualify for debt forgiveness include a job loss, a significant drop in income or medical bills.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nDebt can feel overwhelming, but solutions like credit card debt forgiveness can provide much-needed relief for those struggling to keep up with payments. By negotiating a settlement, borrowers may be able to significantly reduce what they owe, avoiding years of costly interest and accelerating their path to financial stability. While there are some trade-offs, such as potential credit score impacts and service fees, the long-term benefits of reducing debt burdens can far outweigh these temporary setbacks.",

        "content": "Loudoun County, Virginia — The fate of a historic property once home to one of America's Founding Fathers is uncertain after the Virginia state legislature rejected efforts last month to make Oak Hill, home of President James Monroe, a public park.\n\nLoudoun County's Oak Hill is the only home belonging to one of the country's earliest presidents which remains in private hands.\n\n\"I think he loved the place,\" Gayle Delashmutt, whose family has owned and cared for the property for more than 70 years, told CBS News.\n\nDelashmutt said there was \"quite a bit of correspondence\" between Monroe and President Thomas Jefferson \"about the design of the house.\"\n\nThe family is ready to move on, but there's just one catch.\n\n\"I had no idea it was going to be so hard to give this place away,\" Delashmutt said.\n\nOak Hill, the estate formerly belonging to President James Monroe, in Loudoun County, Virginia. March 2025. CBS News\n\nSince acquiring the property in 1948 at auction, the Delashmutt family has carefully maintained the home and its 1,200 acres. Walking through the home, which was built by enslaved people more than 200 years ago, its history can be felt. The office where Monroe drafted the Monroe Doctrine, which established the tenets of U.S. foreign policy, was in what is today Oak Hill's dining room. Over the years, the family has received top-dollar offers from developers. But the family wants the house and expansive grounds to be preserved as a state park.\n\n\"They could probably sell it for three times as much money as we're paying for it,\" said Heather Richards, Virginia director of\n\nthe Conservation Fund, a nonprofit preservation group, which has agreed to purchase the property for $20 million.\n\nThe Conservation Fund has helped put together another $32 million to turn it into a state park and museum, as well as fund operating expenses for at least a decade. Of that $52 million total, Loudoun County has agreed to provide $22 million in public money to the Conservation Fund in the form of a grant.\n\nAccording to Richards, a recently completed feasibility study commissioned by the Conservation Fund determined that the property could be operated without public funding for at least the next 10 years.\n\n\"The study shows that this property can be acquired, opened and operated with the funding that is being provided well into the future,\" Richards said.\n\nBut in February, the Virginia General Assembly rejected a bill to authorize the plan, which Delashmutt admitted left her \"surprised.\"\n\n\"Because we're practically giving it away,\" Delashmutt said. According to Richards, the family received offers of close to $60 million to purchase the property.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Scott Surovell supports the proposal, but said other lawmakers worried the state would end up footing the bills.\n\n\"There's a lot of concern amongst some of the finance committee members about the future economics of the property,\" Surovell told CBS News. \"I think there's a way to figure all this out, but I think it might just take a little more time.\"\n\nOne option involves Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who could include Oak Hill in an amendment to the state's budget. A vote is expected in the state legislature next month.\n\nOak Hill, the estate formerly belonging to President James Monroe, in Loudoun County, Virginia. March 2025. CBS News\n\n\"1,200 acres of open space in Northern Virginia just will not come along again,\" Richards said. \"And we're very hopeful that Governor Youngkin will see that and take advantage of this opportunity.\"\n\nDelashmutt sees this property serving as a \"wonderful teaching tool\" to the public about one of the Founding Fathers.\n\n\"We saw over the 32 years that we were here, how much it was appreciated when people had a chance to come in and learn the history,\" Delashmutt said.\n\nStill in the home are two mantels that were a gift from Revolutionary War hero the Marquis de Lafayette, who visited Oak Hill twice in 1825 as part of his famous tour of the U.S.\n\n\n\n\"He sent these two wonderful Italian marble mantels to Mr. Monroe, which was a pretty, pretty nice house present,\" Delashmutt said.\n\nThe history is more than presidential, it's prehistoric. On the porch are stones excavated from a quarry on the property that reveal evidence of the dinosaurs who once roamed the land.\n\nSays Richards: \"There are untold stories here that can be told through the mechanism of a state park where people can come and learn about the incredible history, of not just the Monroes, but the entire breadth of our history here in the Commonwealth.\"",

They deny all of the allegations against them.\n\nThe brothers' plane — which Andrew Tate said earlier in a post on X cost $185,000 to \"jet across the Atlantic to sign one single piece of paper\" — landed at Bucharest Henri Coanda International Airport shortly before 1:00 a.m. local time Saturday morning.\n\nAfter arriving at their residence near Bucharest, Andrew Tate told reporters they returned because \"innocent men don't run from anything\" and he vowed to clear his name in court.\n\nAndrew Tate, right, speaks to media next to his brother Tristan, after returning from the United States, outside his home on the outskirts of Bucharest, Romania, Saturday, March 22, 2025. Vadim Ghirda / AP\n\n\"After all we've been through, we truly deserve the day in court where it is stated that we've done nothing wrong and that we should have never been in court in the first place. We should have never gone to jail. We should have never had our assets seized. We should have never had our names slandered,\" he said. \"Anyone who believed any of this garbage has a particularly low IQ.\"\n\nThe brothers remain under judicial control, which requires them to appear before judicial authorities in Romania when summoned. Eugen Vidineac, one of the Tate brothers' lawyers in Romania, told The Associated Press that the Tates are due to check in with a surveillance officer on Monday.\n\nThe brothers' return to Romania comes nearly a month after a travel ban imposed on the brothers was lifted in February.\n\nThey arrived at Florida's Fort Lauderdale airport on Feb. 28. When asked about the pair's arrival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told reporters that the state is \"not a place where you're welcome with that type of conduct in the air.\"\n\n\"I don't know how it came to this,\" DeSantis said.\n\nThe brothers have publicly supported President Trump. The Financial Times reported in February that the Trump administration had been pushing Romanian authorities to return the brothers' U.S. passports and allow them to leave the country. Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu told Euronews that U.S. envoy Richard Grenell had raised the case with him at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February. Hurezeanu denied that he had been pressured.\n\nWhen asked about the brothers' travel to the United States, Mr. Trump said he knew \"nothing about that\" but would \"look into it.\"\n\nAndrew Tate (R) and his brother Tristan Tate arrive at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Feb. 27, 2025, in Florida after a travel ban on them was lifted in Romania, where they face sexual assault and human trafficking charges. Alon Skuy/Getty\n\nDays after the Tates arrived in the U.S., on March 4, Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier said his office had opened a criminal investigation into Andrew and Tristan Tate. He said in a social media post that he directed his office to work with law enforcement to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the brothers.\n\nA day after the investigation was opened, Andrew Tate said in a post on X: \"I didn't commit any crime and they're trying to find one because they don't like me.\"\n\nThe lifting of their two-year travel ban came after a Bucharest court in December ruled that a case against the brothers could not go to trial because of multiple legal and procedural irregularities on the part of the prosecutors. The case, however, remained open.\n\nFor his part, Tristan Tate said after returning to Romania, \"I think it's very telling that we were investigated for two and a half years, and we were dragged ... in front of the media, into prison, out of prison, all this time, and in December last year, a judge said ... there's not evidence enough for this to even go to trial.\"\n\nLast August, Romania's anti-organized crime agency DIICOT also launched a second case against the brothers, investigating allegations of human trafficking, the trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor, influencing statements and money laundering. They have denied those charges as well.\n\nAndrew Tate, 38, a former professional kickboxer and self-described misogynist who has amassed more than 10 million followers on X, has repeatedly claimed that prosecutors in Romania have no evidence against him and that there is a political conspiracy to silence him.\n\n\"There are a lot of people in the world today that do not have faith in Romanian institutions ... but we're going to restore that faith by coming home, as American citizens, going to court, and getting the not guilty that we deserve,\" Andrew Tate said. \"If a court needs to speak to us, we'll be there because we're innocent.\"\n\nThe Tate brothers' legal battles are not limited to Romania.\n\nFour British women who accused Andrew Tate of sexual violence and physical abuse are suing him in the U.K. after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute him. Late last year, a U.K. court ruled that police could seize $3.3 million worth of frozen assets from the brothers to cover years of unpaid taxes.\n\nIn March last year, the Tate brothers appeared at the Bucharest Court of Appeal in a separate case after U.K. authorities issued arrest warrants over allegations of sexual aggression in a case dating back to the period from 2012 to 2015.\n\nThe appeals court granted the U.K. request to extradite the Tates, but only after legal proceedings in Romania have concluded.",

        "content": "After firing more than 200 probationary workers from the nation's federal disaster relief agency, the Trump administration has taken its first step to dismantle the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) just months ahead of hurricane season.\n\nIn an email labeled, \"Hiring Update\" and obtained by CBS News, FEMA informed employees on Friday night of a new hiring process that overhauls contract renewals for more than two-thirds of the agency's workforce, requiring all employees to submit requests for further extensions to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for approval.\n\nThe decision has created confusion among the ranks of thousands of employees impacted, with fears that the new process will effectively gut the majority of FEMA's workforce over the next two to four years by forcing employees to reapply for their jobs through the agency's overseers at DHS.\n\nSpurred by President Trump's executive action last month directing the Department of Government Efficiency or \"DOGE\" to initiate large-scale reductions in the federal workforce, the new policy affects members of the agency's Cadre of On-Call Response known as \"CORE\" as well as FEMA's reservists.\n\n\"This change will apply to most FEMA positions, as two-year and four-year COREs and Reservists compose much of the workforce,\" the email read.\n\nFEMA acting Administrator Cameron Hamilton briefed his leadership team on the decision last week, according to multiple agency sources, prompting regional directors to break the news to employees in all-hands meetings held on Thursday and Friday that left many staffers bewildered and upset.\n\n\"Employees have started to take their leave and go job hunting,\" one current FEMA employee told CBS News. \"They've seen the writing on the wall.\"\n\nFEMA's more than 8,800 CORE employees make up roughly 39% of the agency's workforce, according to a recent U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, and are tasked with delivering disaster assistance before and after hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and other federally declared emergencies. Notably, the first responders are uniquely financed through the Disaster Relief Fund, allowing them to operate through government shutdowns.\n\nCORE employees staff recovery centers, sign up survivors for recovery assistance and perform door-to-door checks on communities that are devastated by storms and extreme weather events. The agency's roughly 7800 reservists make up a temporary, on-call workforce that is also deployed to disasters, emergencies and critical training, nationwide.\n\nThe email directed employees with contract termination dates after March 17 to submit requests for \"renewals and extensions\" to the Department of Homeland Security \"for decision.\"\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters in Washington, D.C. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nThe hiring announcement does not apply to certain positions within The National Flood Insurance Program, and positions including Emergency Management Specialist, Human Resources Specialist, Contracting Specialist, Information Technology Specialist and attorney, according to the email sent to the FEMA workforce, Friday.\n\nThe email also states that all external hiring and onboarding of new employees has been frozen until further notice, except for political appointees.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News on Saturday, a DHS spokesperson said the decision is \"cutting out wasteful spending and bureaucracy that slows down relief efforts.\"\n\n\"FEMA has implemented a full hiring freeze and instituted a DHS review process for all disaster-field positions that are up for renewal. The renewal review applies to the majority of the FEMA workforce,\" the spokesperson said. \"President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem know that disaster recovery efforts are best led by state and local officials, not federal bureaucrats.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing state and local governments to \"play a more active and significant role\" in preparing for emergencies nationwide.\n\n\"I say you don't need FEMA, you need a good state government,\" Mr. Trump said while visiting the Los Angeles communities following devastating wildfires in January. \"FEMA is a very expensive, in my opinion, mostly failed situation.\"\n\nFor months, the president has toyed with the idea of eliminating the agency. The nation's disaster relief arm was established under the Carter administration and later reshuffled under DHS as the department was stood up post-9/11.\n\nProject 2025 policy proposals include a call for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"\n\n\"If states aren't ready, they better get ready,\" one current FEMA employee told CBS News. \"It takes FEMA four months to refresh and restock all of our goods that get sent out for hurricane season. I can't imagine the states are anywhere near staffed up enough or robust enough to handle this mission on their own.\"\n\nFor her part, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has said that while the federal government should play a role in disaster relief, she supports the president's desire to \"get rid of FEMA the way it exists today.\"\n\nThe move to reshape the hiring process for the agency's disaster relief foot soldiers also comes just months before the Atlantic Hurricane Season, which runs from June 1 to November 30.\n\nIn an interview last December, former FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told CBS News the agency sees a federally declared disaster roughly every other day, with nearly 180 emergencies declared in the first 11 months of 2024 – a roughly 50% increase compared to 2023. The former administrator called the back-to-back disaster demands on the agency a \"new normal.\"\n\nCBS News has reached out to FEMA for comment on the new directive.",

He argued that the magazines can allow the gun to function better, and should be considered functional parts, not accessories. He said he had planned to voice his arguments in his dissent but found it \"obviously much more effective to simply show you.\" He stated that the guns featured in the video were inoperable for safety reasons.\n\nJudge Lawrence VanDyke holds up a firearm in his chambers after an appeals court ruled that California's law banning gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition can remain in place. U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit\n\nHis colleagues on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a law banning large-capacity gun magazines was allowed under the Second Amendment, finding in a 7-4 decision that large-capacity magazines are not considered \"arms\" or \"protected accessories.\" The dissenting judges, including VanDyke, wrote that magazines holding more than 10 rounds are \"the most common magazines in the country\" and are sold with most guns.\n\nIn her concurrence with the ruling, Judge Marsha Berzon criticized VanDyke's video, saying that he had \"in essence appointed himself as an expert witness in the case\" and provided \"a factual presentation with the express aim of convincing the readers of his view of the facts without complying with any of the procedural safeguards that usually apply to experts and their testimony, while simultaneously serving on the panel deciding the case.\"\n\nBerzon also called it \"wildly improper\" and said it should be commented on \"lest the genre proliferate.\"\n\nVanDyke was nominated by President Trump during his first term and confirmed in December 2019. The Senate confirmed him in a 51-44 vote.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nA debt management plan can be helpful when you're struggling with high-rate debt, but it may not always work over the long term. Getty Images\n\nDealing with mounting debt issues can be difficult to do on your own, especially if you've racked up a hefty amount of credit card debt at today's high rates. When these issues arise, certain debt relief options, like debt management plans, can seem like the perfect solution to regain financial stability. These plans, which are typically offered by credit counseling agencies, help consolidate multiple debts into one monthly payment, often with reduced interest rates and waived fees. The goal is to simplify the repayment process and make it more manageable.\n\nHowever, committing to a debt management plan is a big decision, and it's not always the best fit for everyone over the long term. Your life circumstances can change in unexpected ways over time, and if that happens, a debt management plan could end up being less effective than it once was. In some cases, your financial situation may have improved and you no longer need the program. In other cases, it may not be working out as you had hoped, and you're struggling to keep up with the payments.\n\nWhatever the reason, you might be questioning whether you can — or should — exit your debt management plan. Below, we'll detail what to consider next.\n\nGet help with your high-rate debt here now.\n\nCan you get out of a debt management plan after enrolling?\n\nYou generally have the option to exit a debt management plan at any point after enrolling. Debt management plans are voluntary agreements between you, your creditors and the credit counseling agency facilitating the program. You are not legally obligated to remain in the plan, and most programs allow you to cancel at any time.\n\nHowever, leaving a debt management plan isn't as simple as just stopping payments. When you enroll, your creditors typically agree to certain concessions, such as lowering your interest rates, waiving late fees or stopping collection efforts. Exiting the plan means these benefits may be revoked, and you might return to your original interest rates and payment terms. Your creditors may also reinstate any fees or penalties that were previously waived, increasing your overall debt burden.\n\nSo, if you're considering canceling, it's crucial to contact your credit counseling agency first. They can help you explore alternative options, such as adjusting your payment plan to make it more manageable or discussing hardship options with creditors. Simply stopping payments without a plan in place, though, can negatively impact your financial stability.\n\nExplore how working with a debt relief expert could benefit you now.\n\nWhen it could make sense to cancel a debt management plan\n\nWhile debt management plans can be helpful, there are situations where canceling might be a reasonable choice. Here are some common reasons why you might consider exiting your plan:\n\nYour financial situation has improved : If your income has significantly increased or you've received a financial windfall, you might be able to pay off your debts faster\n\n: If your income has significantly increased or you've received a financial windfall, you might be able to The plan isn't working for you : If you're struggling to make the required monthly payments, it could indicate that the plan isn't sustainable for your financial situation. In this case, your other debt relief options, such as debt forgiveness bankruptcy\n\n: If you're struggling to make the required monthly payments, it could indicate that the plan isn't sustainable for your financial situation. In this case, your other debt relief options, such as You want to pursue a different debt relief strategy : If you find a more effective way to manage your debt, such as a lower-rate consolidation loan, you might decide to leave your debt management plan in favor of that alternative.\n\n: If you find a more effective way to manage your debt, such as a lower-rate consolidation loan, you might decide to leave your debt management plan in favor of that alternative. You need more flexibility : Debt management plans require you to make fixed monthly payments, which can be challenging if your income is unpredictable. If you need more flexibility in managing your debt, canceling may be an option.\n\n: Debt management plans require you to make fixed monthly payments, which can be challenging if your income is unpredictable. If you need more flexibility in managing your debt, canceling may be an option. Your credit score has improved: Enrolling in a debt management plan typically doesn't hurt your credit score\n\nBefore canceling, though, you should be sure to weigh the potential risks and benefits carefully. If you're unsure as to whether it's the right move, a financial advisor or your credit counselor can help you determine the best course of action.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nA debt management plan can be a useful tool for paying off debt, but it's not a lifelong commitment. If your financial circumstances change or if the plan isn't working for you, exiting is an option. However, it's important to understand the potential consequences, such as losing creditor concessions and facing higher interest rates.\n\nIf you're considering leaving your debt management plan, talk to your credit counseling agency first. They can help you explore alternatives that might work better for your situation. Whether you choose to stay enrolled in the plan, modify it or choose a different strategy, though, just be sure you're making an informed decision — one that keeps you on the path to financial stability.",

        "content": "We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nThe average homeowner is sitting on more than $250,000 worth of home equity right now. Getty Images\n\nBorrowing money comes with major concerns in today's economic environment, thanks to a frozen federal funds rate that has kept costs high on everything from mortgages to personal loans and more. One borrowing option that has remained relatively affordable, however, is reserved for homeowners via home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). And in the current climate in which home prices are high, there's an average of $313,000 worth of equity to utilize. That said, you won't necessarily be able to borrow all of that money.\n\nMost home equity lenders limit borrowers to 80% of their equity when applying for a home equity loan or HELOC. In the average scenario, that equates to just over $250,000. Still, your home is generally your most important financial asset, so borrowing from it should always be approached judiciously, and even more so if you're contemplating borrowing a quarter of a million dollars. To better prepare for this decision, then, it helps to calculate the potential monthly repayment costs tied to the home equity loan rates readily available for qualified borrowers in early 2025. Below, we'll do the math.\n\nStart by seeing how low of a home equity loan rate you could qualify for here.\n\nHow much does a $250,000 home equity loan cost monthly in 2025?\n\nTo determine the monthly costs of a home equity loan, potential borrowers will need three figures: the amount being withdrawn (in this case, $250,000), the interest rate available (assuming the lowest rates for qualified borrowers), and the repayment period (typically 10- or 15-years). Here, then, is what a $250,000 home equity loan would cost monthly if secured now, in March 2025:\n\n10-year home equity loan at 8.50%: $3,099.64 per month\n\n$3,099.64 per month 15-year home equity loan at 8.44%: $2,453.06 per month\n\nWhile those rates are the averages for those specific repayment periods, the overall home equity loan median rate is a bit lower at 8.37% now. Here's what payments spread over that same period would then look like:\n\n10-year home equity loan at 8.37%: $3,082.29 per month\n\n$3,082.29 per month 15-year home equity loan at 8.37%: $2,442.84 per month\n\nIt's also important to remember that, unlike HELOCs that have a draw period before repayments are required, home equity loans function differently. Since the funds will be provided up-front via one lump sum, borrowers will be expected to make the above payments right away. So it's important to determine affordability before applying, as you'll be expected to start paying back your lender immediately. And, if you fail to do so, you could risk losing your home to the lender in the process.\n\nReview your current home equity loan options carefully here.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhether you're borrowing $25,000 worth of home equity via a loan or ten times that amount, it's always important to first calculate your potential repayment costs. This is especially important to do now, with interest rates unpredictable and the impacts of years-long inflation still making it difficult to cover many daily expenses. By doing the math, and understanding what you can and can't afford, you'll determine if a home equity loan is truly beneficial for you now or if you should instead consider alternative borrowing sources.",

        "content": "The Pentagon's intelligence and law enforcement arms are investigating what it says are leaks of national security information. Defense Department personnel could face polygraphs in the latest such inquiry by the Trump administration.\n\nA memo late Friday from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's chief of staff Joe Kasper referred to \"recent unauthorized disclosures\" of such information but provided no details about alleged leaks.\n\nEarlier in the day, President Trump rejected reports that adviser Elon Musk would be briefed on how the United States would fight a hypothetical war with China.\n\n\"If this effort results in information identifying a party responsible for an unauthorized disclosure,\" then such information \"will be referred to the appropriate criminal entity for criminal prosecution,\" according to the memo.\n\nEarlier this month, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pledged to use lie detector tests on employees to identify those who may be leaking information about operations to the media.\n\nIn a video posted to social media, Noem wrote that the department had \"identified two leakers of information here at the Department of Homeland Security who have been telling individuals about our operations and putting law enforcement lives in jeopardy. We plan to prosecute these two individuals and hold them accountable for what they've done.\"\n\nThe polygraph tests at the DHS had been going on for several weeks, a spokesperson CBS News at the time. It wasn't clear how many employees had undergone them.\n\nThe results of that investigation have not yet been released.\n\nThe Justice Department on Friday announced an investigation into \"the selective leak of inaccurate, but nevertheless classified, information\" from intelligence agencies about Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang whose members in the U.S. are being targeted for removal by the Republican administration.\n\nLeaks occur in every administration — and government officials can be the source — as a trial balloon to test how a potential policy decision will be received.\n\nWhile polygraph exams are typically not admissible in court proceedings, they are frequently used by federal law enforcement agencies and for national security clearances. In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled they were also inadmissible in military justice proceedings.\n\nThey are inadmissible because they are unreliable and often result in false positives, said George Maschke, a former Army interrogator and reserve intelligence officer who went on to found AntiPolygraph.org. Mashke failed a polygraph himself when applying to the FBI.\n\nBut they have been intermittently used since the 1990s to intimidate and scare sources from talking to reporters, Maschke said. A 1999 Pentagon report said it was expanding the program to use polygraphs on defense personnel \"if classified information they had access to has been leaked.\"",

        "content": "Kitty Dukakis, the former first lady of Massachusetts and the outspoken wife of 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, has died, her family said. She was 88 years old.\n\nDukakis died on Friday night surrounded by her family, her son, John Dukakis, said. She fought to make the world better, \"sharing her vulnerabilities to help others face theirs,\" her family said in a statement.\n\n\"She was loving, feisty and fun, and had a keen sensitivity to people from all walks of life,\" the family said. \"She and our dad, Michael Dukakis, shared an enviable partnership for over 60 years and loved each other deeply.\"\n\nDukakis was first lady of Massachusetts from 1975 to 1979 and then from 1983 to 1991 while her husband served three terms as governor. They were longtime residents of Brookline.\n\nKitty Dukakis remembered by friends, family\n\n\"She's always been one of my heroines,\" said Phil Johnston, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services under Governor Dukakis. He worked with the first lady for decades.\n\nHe said he remembered how passionate she was about immigration and homelessness. \"She was also very involved in the Jewish community.\"\n\nWBZ-TV political analyst Jon Keller says that Dukakis played a key role for women.\n\n\"She was also well known and regarded as a policy advisor. She had an office in the state house. Her influence on policies toward the homeless, caring for children, and funding for the arts was acknowledged by Michael as very significant, and it's legacy that lives on today,\" WBZ-TV political analyst Jon Keller said.\n\nKitty Dukakis detailed struggles with addiction\n\nOn the 1988 campaign trail, Dukakis revealed that she had an addiction to diet pills. After her husband's loss in the general election, she published a memoir about her struggle with alcohol.\n\nIn 2017, Dukakis spoke to \"60 Minutes\" about using electroconvulsive therapy to treat her chronic depression. She was one of the most high-profile supporters of the controversial treatment known as shock therapy.\n\nKeller: Kitty Dukakis courageously challenged stereotypes as a political spouse\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter appointed Dukakis to serve on the President's Commission on the Holocaust, and she was a founding member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nDukakis won high marks as a political campaigner during her husband's 1988 presidential efforts, stumping tirelessly for him. She was called a key influence in his decision to seek the presidency.\n\nShe even figured in the opening question of a 1988 presidential debate, when her husband was asked: \"Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\" Dukakis said he would not, and his unemotional response was widely criticized.\n\n\"A force for good\"\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey called Dukakis \"a force for good in public life and behind the scenes.\"\n\n\"She was a strong advocate for children, women and refugees, while also taking a leadership role in ensuring that the horrors of the Holocaust are never forgotten. She spoke courageously about her struggles with substance use disorder and mental health, which serves as an inspiration to us all to break down stigma and seek help,\" Healey said in a statement. \"My heart is with Governor Dukakis and their loved ones during this difficult time.\"\n\nKitty Dukakis, who was divorced and had a 3-year-old son, married Michael Dukakis in 1963, and they had two children, Andrea and Kara.",

        "content": "Tel Aviv — Israel's defense minister threatened earlier this week to open \"the gates of hell\" in Gaza if Hamas refuses to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demands, and Israel has been delivering. At least 58 people were killed in a third consecutive night of airstrikes up and down the Palestinian territory, bringing the death toll to an estimated 500 people since the ceasefire was shattered with Tuesday's shock pre-dawn Israeli missile barrages, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Ministry of Health.\n\nMore than a dozen people were killed overnight in a strike on just one house, the home of the Mubarak family in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. They had gathered to mourn an earlier death. Survivors whisked the bodies of the dead to a hospital by ambulance and horse cart.\n\nThere were reports of fresh airstrikes early Thursday morning near Khan Younis and Rafah in the south of Gaza, near the border with Egypt.\n\nIsrael resumes ground operations in Gaza\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces confirmed Tuesday that it had also resumed ground operations in central Gaza, again dividing the strip into north and south along the Netzarim corridor and blocking movement across the line. The IDF said it was also stationing a brigade of troops in the south, while airdropping fliers warning civilians to evacuate from areas around the entire Gaza border, which it warned would be turned back into combat zones.\n\nA child looks on as people mourn Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes, at the European Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, March 20, 2025. Hatem Khaled/REUTERS\n\n\"The IDF does not intend to harm you,\" a post by the IDF spokesman for Arab Media said on X. \"For your safety it is forbidden to approach IDF forces in the defensive zone and in any place where they are deployed.\"\n\nThat message followed a severe threat from Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz to the citizens of Gaza.\n\n\"Residents of Gaza, this is a final warning,\" he said in a video broadcast Wednesday afternoon. \"If all the Israeli hostages are not released and Hamas is not eliminated from Gaza Israel will act with forces you have never known before. Take the advice of the U.S. President. Return the hostages and eliminate Hamas, and other options will open up for you — including going to other places in the world for those who wish. The alternative is complete destruction and devastation.\"\n\nIt appeared to be a threat of collective punishment against Gaza's civilian population for the actions of Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S.\n\nCollective punishment is considered a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, though neither the U.S. nor Israel are signatories to that treaty.\n\nU.S. strikes Houthis as Yemeni rebels fire missiles at Israel, U.S. ships\n\nIsrael's renewed bombing of Gaza has drawn fierce condemnation from most of the country's Arab neighbors, and renewed efforts by Houthi militants in Yemen to target Israel and ships in the Red Sea with missiles.\n\nThe Houthis claimed Thursday that they had fired a \"hypersonic ballistic missile\" at Israel before dawn - the second claimed launch in three days. The group said it had attempted to hit Ben Gurion international airport south of Tel Aviv, and air raid alarms shattered the peace many Israelis had grown accustomed to during two months of the ceasefire at 4 a.m. across the city and central Israel.\n\n\"A missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the IAF (Israeli Air Force) prior to crossing into Israeli territory,\" the IDF said in a statement minutes after an all-clear was given. No damage was reported.\n\nThe Houthis also claimed to have targeted the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier strike group and its warships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles, but the U.S. military said there were no impacts.\n\nThe U.S. has responded to the Houthis' resumption of rocket launches with strikes against the group. Overnight, the U.S. struck targets in Yemen's capital of Sanaa, according to Houthi-run Al Masirah TV. At least nine women and children were wounded in a residential neighborhood, a spokesperson for the Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry claimed in a post on X.\n\nPeople stand near buildings damaged by U.S. military strikes, in Sanaa, Yemen, March 20, 2025. Khaled Abdullah/REUTERS\n\nU.S. strikes also hit targets in southern Yemen, in a province known to have Houthi military sites and weapons warehouses.\n\nPresident Trump had threatened on his Truth Social media platform that the group would \"be completely annihilated.\"\n\nThursday morning, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a post on X that American \"forces continue 24/7 operations against the Iran-backed Houthis,\" sharing undated videos of U.S. fighter jets taking off from an aircraft carrier.\n\nAt least 31 people have been killed in Yemen by the U.S. airstrikes, according to Yemeni media reports.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, CENTCOM said the Houthis had seized control of a World Food Program warehouse in the northern Yemeni city of Saada containing over 5,700,000 pounds of food and other humanitarian aid intended for civilians.\n\n\"This is another example of the Houthi's complete and reckless disregard for the people of Yemen and aggression toward the humanitarian operations that help those in need,\" CENTCOM said. \"The Houthis continue to violate international humanitarian law, as well as put aid workers and the Yemini people at risk. The Houthis care nothing for the Yemeni people.\"\n\nEditor's note: This article previously cited a leaflet dropped by Israeli forces in Gaza, but CBS News understands that leaflet was dropped in January, not this week.

He will return to the Vatican, but doctors said he will need at least two months of rest and rehabilitation after leaving Rome's Gemelli Hospital.\n\nThe 88-year-old pontiff has been battling double pneumonia in both lungs after he was admitted to the hospital on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis that made it difficult for him to speak. He has remained out of public view since then.\n\nHis doctors held an in-person briefing on Saturday evening, the first in about a month.\n\n\"The good news is that the pope will be discharged tomorrow,\" Gemelli medical director Dr. Sergio Alfieri said. \"During his hospitalization, he presented two critical episodes during which the Holy Father's life was in danger. He subsequently made slow but progressive improvements.\"\n\nThe director of the Holy See Press Office, Matteo Bruni speaks next to Professor Sergio Alfieri and doctor Luigi Carbone (L) during a press conference at the Gemelli hospital where Pope Francis is hospitalized in Rome, on March 22, 2025. TIZIANA FABI/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAlfieri said Francis will be discharged in stable condition and will continue medication \"for a long time and observe at least two months of rest.\"\n\nDr. Luigi Carbone, the pope's personal doctor, said the discharge is a \"period of convalescence.\"\n\n\"At the Vatican, we have prepared the necessary assistance and we are ready to have him back at Santa Marta,\" he said, adding, \"We hope that within a brief period, he can go back to his normal activity.\"\n\nCarbone said the pope was very happy to be going home.\n\nEarlier Saturday, the Vatican said that Francis will make his first public appearance in five weeks and \"intends to wave and offer blessing\" from the hospital after the Angelus prayers.\n\nThe pope has missed the Angelus prayers for five straight weeks for the first time in his papacy. The Angelus prayers are normally recited by the pope every Sunday from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square to the gathered faithful.\n\nThe current hospitalization is the longest of Francis' papacy. It has been marked by a rollercoaster of setbacks, including respiratory crises, mild kidney failure, and a severe coughing fit, which forced doctors to put Francis on a mechanical ventilation mask. At no point did he lose consciousness, and doctors reported he was alert and cooperative.\n\nThe Argentine pope is prone to respiratory illnesses in the winter. He had part of one lung removed as a young man.\n\nThough out of public view for weeks, the pope shared a recorded message in early March thanking people for their prayers for his recovery. The message – which highlighted Francis' weak and labored voice – was played in St. Peter's Square for the faithful gathered for a nightly recitation of the rosary prayer. The Vatican also released a photo of the pope at prayer.\n\nDuring his hospital stay, the church celebrated the 12th anniversary of Francis' papacy with a Mass in his honor.\n\nPope Francis has been adamant about sharing an unprecedented level of detail when it comes to his health, going against centuries of secrecy surrounding pontiffs' medical conditions.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "The New Hampshire attorney general's office has agreed to a $10 million settlement in the case of a man who alleged that he was gang-raped in a stairwell at the state's youth detention center in the 1990s.\n\nMichael Gilpatrick's lawsuit against the state would have been the second of more than 1,300 to go to trial, but instead both sides agreed to settle out of court, his lawyers said Saturday.\n\nThe payout is four times the maximum amount available to those who submit claims via the state's settlement fund for abuse victims, though less than half the amount a jury awarded last May in another lawsuit, the first of its kind that went to trial. The $38 million verdict in that case remains in dispute as the state seeks to slash it to $475,000.\n\nGilpatrick, now 41, was 14 when he was sent to the Youth Development Center for three years in 1997. His lawsuit accused 10 staffers at the Manchester facility of sexual or physical abuse, including repeated rapes and being choked to the point of unconsciousness.\n\n\"There was nobody you could go to at YDC to talk to. You were literally stuck in your own thoughts, in your own fear every single day,\" he said in a 2021 interview. \"That place turned us into what we were. I can't say what I am now because I'm a better person now. But coming out of that place, I was a monster.\"\n\nYDC victim Michael Gilpatrick, center, reacts after Bradley Asbury, 70, got the maximum sentence at Hillsborough County Superior Court in Manchester, N.H., Monday, Jan. 27, 2025. David Lane / AP\n\nIn one incident, Gilpatrick said, two staffers held him down in a stairwell while another raped him and a fourth man forced him to perform a sex act. Those allegations resulted in criminal charges against four former staffers whom Gilpatrick called a \"hit squad;\" two of them have faced trial so far.\n\nBrad Asbury, 70, was sentenced to 20 to 40 years in prison after being convicted in November of being an accomplice to aggravated sexual assault. But jurors deadlocked in January on whether Stephen Murphy was guilty of rape, leading to a mistrial. Murphy, who denied assaulting Gilpatrick, faces three other trials related to other former residents.\n\n\"The four of them used to roll together, and they would go to different cottages and beat kids,\" Gilpatrick testified at the first civil trial. \"They would literally come over and just go door to door and beat every single one of us, down the line.\"\n\nThe settlement spares Gilpatrick from what likely would have been another emotionally difficult court proceeding. He also testified at the two criminal trials, at times lashing out angrily at defense lawyers.\n\nHe said he did not tell anyone what happened to him at the time because dorm leaders were involved in the assault, and he then spent decades trying to bury his memories.\n\n\"Once I was about to accept the fact that it wasn't my fault and I was able to stop blaming myself, I knew I had to say something,\" he testified on Jan. 16.\n\nEleven former youth counselors have been arrested since the attorney general's office began investigating the facility in 2019, though charges against one were dropped, another was found incompetent to stand trial and a third died awaiting trial. Two men have been convicted, and another case that ended in a hung jury is expected to be retried later this year.\n\nThe Associated Press generally does not identify those who say they were victims of sexual assault unless they have come forward publicly, as Gilpatrick and others have done.\n\nThe youth center, which once housed upward of 100 children but now typically serves fewer than a dozen, is named for former Gov.

        "content": "Israel launched a strike on Lebanon on Saturday in retaliation for rockets on Israeli targets — killing two, including a child — in the heaviest exchange of fire since the ceasefire last year.\n\nEarlier, rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel, for the second time since December, sparking concern about whether the fragile ceasefire with the militant group would hold.\n\nIsrael said Saturday that it would respond \"severely\" to the attack from Lebanon after the rockets were fired into northern Israel. The army said it intercepted rockets that were targeting the Israeli town of Metula.\n\nLebanese people inspect the destruction of a building that was targeted in an Israeli air strike in the southern Lebanese village of Touline on March 22, 2025. STR/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister's office said Saturday it instructed the army to act \"forcefully\" against dozens of targets in Lebanon, adding: \"Israel will not allow any harm to its citizens and sovereignty.\" Israel's army said Saturday it was carrying out strikes on Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon.\n\nA Hezbollah official told The Associated Press Saturday that it was not responsible for the attack, calling it \"primitive,\" speaking on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nIn a statement, Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam asked the Lebanese military to take all necessary measures in the south but said the country did not want to return to war.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into an all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.\n\nUnder the ceasefire reached in November, Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January. The deadline was then extended to Feb. 18 by agreement between Lebanon and Israel.\n\nBut since then, Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon, across from communities in northern Israel, and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah. Lebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw from the country.\n\nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made, saying further escalation could have serious consequences for the region.\n\nThe strikes on Lebanon come a day after Israel said it would carry out operations in Gaza \"with increasing intensity\" until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed alive.\n\nThe attack by Hamas-led militants in 2023 killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "When Irene Wells was diagnosed with the \"silent killer\" of cancers, she asked doctors not to tell her what stage it was.\n\nShe already knew plenty about pancreatic cancer. A friend had died of it after years of treatment. Her daughter-in-law works in pancreatic cancer research. The five-year survival rate for the disease, even when caught early, is 12%, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Most patients are diagnosed late and usually live less than a year after that diagnosis.\n\nWells, a retired teacher, had been healthy her whole life, she told CBS News, and the diagnosis had been sudden: She had been feeling tired, and one day her husband noticed that her skin was jaundiced. She and her husband flew from their home in Las Vegas to see doctors at Mass General Brigham, where her daughter-in-law works. An MRI conducted at Mass General Brigham found the cancer. Wrapping her head around the diagnosis was enough. She didn't want to know just how poor the odds were.\n\n\"It's so surreal because you're feeling really good, you don't have pain or anything like that. It's called the silent killer, as I found out,\" Wells, 73, said. \"I'm always looking at the brighter side, and I wanted to continue that way.\"\n\nIrene Wells and her youngest grandson. Irene Wells\n\nMass General Brigham surgical oncologist Dr. Motaz Qadan developed an aggressive treatment plan. He was going to start with surgery — but when he opened her abdomen, he found the cancer had metastasized to her liver. That meant it was Stage IV — the latest stage. The team had to close up and come up with a new plan. Wells still didn't want to know the specifics of what was going on, but trusted Qadan when he advised chemotherapy and radiation. If those treatments were successful, he said, they could do a second surgery to resect the cancer.\n\n\"I told my doctors 'I want to live. I want to see my grandkids grow up a little more,'\" Wells said. \"I said 'Give me the hardest stuff you can get. I'll get through this.'\"\n\nTreating pancreatic cancer\n\nIn April 2023, Wells began chemotherapy, followed by radiation. It was an exhausting experience, she said. In November 2023, Qadan cleared Wells for a Whipple procedure, a surgery where the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the bile duct and small intestine are removed.\n\nIrene Wells holding her youngest grandson while she was in treatment. Irene Wells\n\nWhipples aren't typically done once cancer has metastasized, Qadan said, because the cancer cells have escaped the organs that the procedure addresses.\n\n\"It doesn't help to take out the primary tumor knowing there is cancer elsewhere and cells spreading in between,\" he said. But in \"exceptional cases,\" chemotherapy, radiation or other surgical options can address the spread, he said.\n\nWells seemed to be one of those exceptional cases, Qadan said.\n\n\"Everything that was there before appeared to be resolving. Everything that we could see in the pancreas appeared to be shrinking and getting smaller,\" Qadan said.\n\nInside the operating room in November 2023, Qadan and his team found there was no cancer left on Wells' liver or pancreas. That meant that she had had \"a complete pathological response,\" Qadan said, which is considered the best-case scenario for cancer treatment. After the Whipple was completed, pathologists examined the pancreas and found that there was no trace of cancer.\n\n\"As I was coming out of the anesthesia, (Dr. Qadan), he goes, 'You're my miracle girl,'\" Wells remembered.\n\nBecoming a \"long-term\" pancreatic cancer survivor\n\nAn outcome like Wells' is extremely unusual, said Dr. Ryan Sugarman, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who focuses on gastrointestinal cancers, including pancreatic cancer. Sugarman was not involved in Wells' care. Pancreatic cancer is a \"really resistant\" disease, he said, but there have been cases of a person responding incredibly well to the treatment.\n\n\"I think there's a variety of ways a patient's tumor may respond to chemo that we don't fully understand,\" Sugarman explained.\n\nQadan estimated he has seen complete pathological response in 5% to 8% of patients, but those patients' cancers usually have not metastasized, he said.\n\n\"I think that (Wells) might be the only patient who I've ever taken, who had a metastatic lesion and then went on to have complete pathologic response everywhere,\" he said.\n\nLong-term survivors of pancreatic cancer are the focus of plenty of research, surgical oncologist Dr. Vinod Balachandran told CBS News in February 2025. Such studies inspired research Balachandran has been doing into an mRNA vaccine that shows promise in treating early-stage pancreatic cancer.\n\nSugarman said he would consider someone who has no evidence of cancer more than five years after diagnosis a long-term survivor. These patients are far more likely to be those whose cancer was found at an early stage, he said. Long-term Stage IV survivors are \"exceedingly rare,\" he said.\n\n\"I try to stay positive\"\n\nWells had no trace of cancer after surgery, but she still had a long road to recovery. It took about a year for her energy and stamina to return to where they had once been. After the surgery, she had digestive issues and lost nearly 65 pounds. She also was diagnosed with diabetes, which she manages with an endocrinologist.\n\nAfter the treatment, she learned just how advanced her cancer had been. There is about a 60% chance of recurrence for pancreatic cancer patients, even after surgery and chemotherapy, Sugarman said. The odds are worse for someone who had later-stage disease. Wells undergoes tests every three months to make sure the cancer hasn't reoccurred and says it's something she tries not to think about.\n\nIrene Wells and her grandson wearing shirts from a \"Kicks for Cancer\" fundraising soccer tournament. Irene Wells\n\n\"Every time I talk to somebody, they have a story about a friend who had pancreatic cancer who died,\" Wells said. \"I try not to go down that dark road. I try to stay positive.\"\n\nWells, a mother of three and grandmother to six, instead focuses on time with her loved ones. She babysits her youngest grandson, 1, twice a week. She has planned trips to see old friends. Wells and her husband didn't celebrate their 50th anniversary because she was in treatment, so they're taking the entire family on a week-long Disney cruise this summer.\n\n\"I want to live as long as I can, and be healthy, of course. I feel good now. It's a miracle,\" Wells said. \"I've done a lot in my life, but I would like to do a little bit more.\"",

        "content": "A man pretending to represent a professional basketball player allegedly swallowed hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stolen Tiffany jewelry, according to court documents. Police said that it took 12 days to recover the pieces.\n\nJaythan Gilder, 32, of Houston, Texas, allegedly robbed a Tiffany & Co. jewelry store in a mall in Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 26, according to an arrest affidavit reviewed by CBS News. Gilder allegedly entered the store wearing a red hat, a red Polo-brand shirt, and very ripped blue jeans, police said. He allegedly told store staff that his name was Shawn and he was a negotiating a sale on behalf of a player on the Orlando Magic basketball team.\n\nGilder was brought into the store's VIP room because of the value of the jewelry involved in the transaction, store staff told police. The merchandise included two pairs of diamond earrings and a diamond ring. The pairs of earrings are valued at $160,000 and $609,500 each, and the ring is valued at $587,000, store staff told police.\n\nJaythan Gilder in the Tiffany & Co. VIP room. Orlando Police Department\n\nDuring the consultation in the VIP room, Gilder allegedly jumped out of his seat and grabbed the merchandise. He then allegedly attempted to leave the VIP room by \"violently pushing and pulling\" at the sliding doors. Store associate Amit Nayee tried to stop Gilder, according to court documents, but Gilder \"violently pushes and pulls his arms.\" Police said they saw visible injuries on Nayee's arms.\n\nDuring the scuffle, the diamond ring was dropped. Gilder was able to keep possession of the earrings and get the doors open enough to escape, police said. He allegedly ran through the store and dodged other staff members. One store employee told police that she feared Gilder had a gun. He left through the store's front doors and left the mall, police said.\n\nJaythan Gilder fights store employee Amit Nayee. Orlando Police Department\n\nA man matching Gilder's description was seen on mall parking lot security cameras getting into a blue 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander. They were able to follow the car through public safety cameras and toll records. Florida Highway Patrol was notified on the vehicle's make, model and license plate number.\n\nShortly before 8 p.m. local time on Feb. 26, the highway patrol pulled over a car matching that description for a traffic violation. The driver of the car allegedly resisted the investigation and was arrested on resisting charges separate from the incident. Highway patrol officials identified the driver as Gilder. Earring forms and price tags from Tiffany & Co. were found on the floor of the vehicle.\n\nAs he was being taken into custody, Gilder allegedly swallowed several items. The highway patrol officers transporting him to jail heard him allegedly say \"I should have thrown them out the window.\"\n\nGilder was then taken to Washington County Jail, where a live scan showed several foreign objects in his stomach. Police suspect the items are the Tiffany earrings he left the store with. The two pairs have a combined value of $769,500.\n\nNayee identified Gilder in a lineup at the jail.\n\nA scan of Gilder's stomach shows foreign bodies. Orlando Police Department\n\nAt the jail, Gilder allegedly asked staff \"Am I going to be charged with what's in my stomach?\"\n\nThe Orlando Police Department said on social media that Gilder was monitored by detectives at an area hospital for \"more than a dozen days\" before the earrings were expelled from his system.\n\n\"This case quickly turned into a marathon, not a sprint,\" Goss said.\n\nDet. Aaron Goss said in a social media video that the earrings were brought back to Tiffany's, where the store's master jeweler confirmed that serial numbers on the jewelry matched the stolen pieces. The earrings were cleaned by Tiffany's, Goss said.\n\nThree of the earrings recovered from Gilder's stomach. Orlando Police Department\n\nGilder was charged with grand theft in the first degree, and robbery with a mask, according to court documents. Gilder was not masked at the time of the robbery, but was wearing a gauze nose covering and arm bandage, as well as a hat, and police said this \"indicates by state statute\" that he committed robbery with a mask, since the items were used to conceal his identity. Both are felonies.\n\nGilder remains in custody at the Orange County Jail, according to online records.\n\nPolice said that a search of Gilder's criminal history found he was charged in a near-identical robbery from a Tiffany & Co. store in Texas in 2022. He is also being held on 48 separate \"failure to appear\" warrants out of the state of Colorado.",

        "content": "President Trump on Friday night rescinded the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, several members of the Biden administration, and other prominent Democrats.\n\nThe move comes after Mr. Trump had already announced last month that he was revoking former President Joe Biden's security clearance. In a memo Friday, the president said he was also rescinding the security clearances of the entire Biden family.\n\nAlso losing their access to classified information and their security clearances were former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Manhattan Attorney General Alvin Bragg, former White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, former Rep. Elizabeth Cheney, former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill, former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, former U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic Norman Eisen, and attorney Mark Zaid, who was a lawyer for the whistleblower who reported concerns about the Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine in his first White House term.\n\nSeveral of those named, including James and Bragg, had already had their clearances revoked earlier this month by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard as part of a purge of dozens of clearances for current and former officials.\n\nFriday's memo applies to \"receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the Intelligence Community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress.\"\n\nSince taking office in January, the president has revoked the clearances of multiple former officials who he claims \"weaponized\" either the intelligence community or the law against him.\n\nCheney and Kinzinger helped lead the House select committee investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Bragg brought the New York \"hush money\" criminal case which resulted in a felony conviction for Mr. Trump on 34 state counts of falsification of business records.\n\nJames sued Mr. Trump and the Trump organization, accusing them of widespread fraud. The lengthy trial resulted in a judge's $453 million verdict against Mr. Trump and his former company.\n\nThose who had previously had their clearances revoked include retired Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Trump and Biden administrations and had a public falling out in the final months of Mr. Trump's first term over the photo op in front of St. John's Church in June 2020 after federal officers cleared out social justice protesters from Lafayette Park so Mr. Trump could walk to the church from the White House.\n\nMr. Trump was also critical of Milley's revelation that he had engaged in two phone calls — one on Oct. 30, 2020, and the second on Jan. 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol insurrection — with Chinese General Li Zuocheng of the People's Liberation Army in order to assure him that the U.S. would not launch an attack against China and that the U.S. was stable.\n\nOn the day of his inauguration, Mr. Trump revoked the clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming that emails found on a laptop owned by Biden's son, Hunter, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nJohn Bolton, who served as national security adviser during Mr. Trump's first term, also had his clearance pulled over a book he penned about his time in the role.\n\nThe president accused Bolton of publishing sensitive information and said the book's publication \"created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed.\"\n\n, and contributed to this report.",

Conference player of the year RJ Luis Jr. had nine points, half his season average, on 3-of-17 shooting.\n\n\"They outplayed us. They deserve to move on and we don't,\" Pitino said. \"That's what March Madness is all about. No matter how good a regular season you have, you play this way, you're going to get beat.\"\n\nPitino's history in Providence — he took the Friars to the 1987 Final Four — gave him a home-court advantage as he arrived in March Madness with an unprecedented sixth school.\n\nSo many of those teams were built with a full-court defense and 3-point shooting.\n\nSt. John's, which beat Omaha in the first round, had the No. 1 defense in the country this season to win the Big East, returning to the tournament for the first time since 2019 with a No. 2 seed that was its best in 25 years.\n\nBut the Red Storm's shooting deserted them on Saturday and they became the first team seeded fourth or better to exit what's been a chalky tournament so far.\n\n\"Rick did a good job with his team all year,\" Calipari said. \"If they made a few shots, they probably beat us. We were fortunate to get out.\"\n\nThe teams combined to make four 3-pointers on 41 attempts, with St. John's shooting 28% from the floor overall.\n\n\"I hate to see them go out this way,\" Pitino said. \"We thought we were championship-driven in our minds, but I have been disappointed before with this. You hate to see us play like that.\n\n\"I don't mind going out with a loss, I just hate to see us play that way offensively,\" he said. \"It's just a bitter pill to swallow with that type of performance.\"\n\nEnd game\n\nArkansas led by 13 in the first half and had an eight-point lead with eight minutes to play before the Johnnies cut it to 62-60 with 6:11 left. But St. John's missed its next six attempts from 3-point range, and made just one of its last nine shots — Ejiofor's dunk with 20 seconds left.\n\nKnox made a pair of free throws, and then Deivon Smith dribbled the ball off his knee and out of bounds. When Richmond was fouled with 5 seconds left, the Razorbacks ran down the court in celebration, waving their arms for the outnumbered Arkansas fans in the crowd.\n\nUp next\n\nArkansas heads to San Francisco to play the winner of Saturday night's matchup in Wichita, Kansas, between third-seeded Texas Tech and No. 11 seed Drake.",

        "content": "Tel Aviv — For a second night in a row, Israel's military launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, killing at least 13 more people by early Wednesday after more than 400 were killed the previous day, according to health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.\n\nIsrael's military said it had targeted a Hamas military site in the enclave's southern al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, near the border with Egypt. At least two civilians were among those killed Wednesday, according to the Red Crescent.\n\nSeparately, the United Nations agency UNOPS, which helps implement humanitarian, development and peacebuilding projects around the world, said Wednesday that one of its staffers had apparently been killed in a blast in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah.\n\n\"Reports are coming in that a UNOPS colleague has been killed in a detonation in Deir al Balah. It is understood that UNOPS accommodation was hit at approximately 11:30 a.m. this morning,\" the agency said.\n\nThe statement from UNOPS came a couple hours after Israel's military issued a statement denying reports that it had struck \"a U.N. compound\" in Deir al-Balah, and adding a call for \"media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports.\"\n\nThe mounting deaths come after Israel definitively ended a two-month ceasefire with Hamas before dawn Tuesday, resuming full-scale military operations in Gaza and threatening to ramp up its assault further. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a national address Tuesday night, vowed more strikes to force Hamas to release all of the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza, about two dozen of whom are still believed to be alive.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel said it launched a \"limited ground operation\" in northern Gaza to retake part of a corridor that bisects it, The Associated Press reported.\n\nEven before Israel resumed military operations it had halted all humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, drawing warnings from aid agencies and the United Nations that civilians would suffer unduly for the impasse in talks aimed at extending the ceasefire.\n\n\"It would be a blessing if this kid passed\"\n\nDr. Marc Perlmutter, an American surgeon who has been volunteering at the al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, northern Gaza, told CBS News on Tuesday that the facility was struggling to cope with the influx of new patients wounded by Israel's attacks, and that young Palestinians were among those with the worst injuries.\n\n\"The level of bodily damage that these children get in particular is insane. My surgeries there consisted of 4- and 5- and 6-year-old kids with significant nerve injuries, and I've had to borrow nerves from both of their legs to graft nerves in their arms,\" he told CBS News in a phone interview. \"Israel has no trouble bombing hospital grounds. Fifty feet from me is a mosque that was thoroughly destroyed. There's no inhibition on their part to focus on population centers.\"\n\nPerlmutter said given the complete lack of medical supplies – he doesn't even have soap to wash his hands – made it impossible to properly treat some of the children coming in with grave injuries.\n\nSpeaking of one boy, he said \"it would be a blessing if this kid passed, because of the amount of pain and the amount of destruction in his body – and our ability to deal with it in this setting is impossibly limited – and there's no place to transfer him to. There's no level-one trauma center. They're all overwhelmed.\"\n\nIsraeli protesters condemn Netanyahu's return to war\n\nBlack plumes rose along Israel's border fence with Gaza on Tuesday as the tired but unrelenting mother of Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker, holding a smoke canister up to the sky, angrily protested Netanyahu's resumption of military operations.\n\n\"Don't let the prime minister and the members of his government sacrifice the lives of my son Matan and of all the other living hostages just to remain in power,\" shouted Zangauker, a prominent leader of the protests that happen every week. \"We will not give up on you, we will not allow a return to fighting.\"\n\nHamas terrorists kidnapped her 25-year-old son from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the unprecedented massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nDemonstrations, led by hostages' families, have exploded across Israel since the strikes in Gaza resumed, with thousands rallying regularly outside Israel's legislature, the Knesset, in Jerusalem and Israel's military headquarters, the Kirya, in Tel Aviv.\n\n\"I don't think they're listening. I don't think that they're listening to the people… to the people who elected them,\" hostage supporter Carmeet Roth told CBS News at a new tent encampment outside the defense complex. She said she was \"horrified\" when Israel's military relaunched airstrikes on Gaza after nearly two months of a fragile ceasefire. Her hopes for more hostages coming out alive have fallen.\n\n\"I think it is much less likely,\" she said, shaking her head. \"We've seen it before. I mean, it never brought them back. Only agreements and deals brought them back. That's the way to move forward.\"\n\nNational polls consistently show a majority of Israelis – 70% in a February survey -- want the ceasefire plan agreed to by Israel and Hamas, which was negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, to continue as originally laid out. A second phase of that plan, which should have begun on March 1, stipulated the release of more living hostages in exchange for the full withdrawal of Israel's military from Gaza.\n\nIsrael, with support from the Trump administration, demanded a change to those terms as Phase-1 of the agreement ended, however, accusing Hamas of breaching the deal and calling for an extension of the first phase under a new plan it attributed to the White House.\n\nWill Gaza assault destroy Hamas, or just leave \"more hostages dead\"?\n\nRetired General Israel Ziv knows a lot about how Israeli forces operate in the Gaza Strip. He commanded the military's Gaza division during the last major clash in the early 2000s, which, while it paled in comparison to the current war, saw heavy casualties on both sides.\n\nBut the 30-year veteran warned that Israel's military may have reached its limit in forcing Hamas to bend to the will of Netanyahu and his far-right government, which has vowed repeatedly to achieve its stated goal of destroying Hamas.\n\n\"You can go up to, let's say, 80%, 90% of destroying the Hamas,\" he said. \"But this last 10%, which is the hardest and the most problematic one, you cannot achieve militarily.\"\n\nZiv said only a political solution could bring a lasting peace between Israel and Hamas, and he accused Netanyahu of operating \"without enough courage to bring some political solutions to the table.\"\n\nZiv said Netanyahu was stuck with a Catch-22: Vowing to free the remaining hostages safely while at the same time trying to kill the people who are holding them.\n\nIsrael Defense Forces International spokesman Nadav Shoshani insists the military is ready to increase pressure on Hamas, and that doing so would bring the remaining hostages home.\n\n\"We're ready with a different set of plans, including more troops on the ground and a ground operation if needed,\" he told CBS News at a briefing this week. \"History shows that the military pressure could bring back hostages.\"\n\nZiv disagrees with that assessment.\n\n\"We know over a year now that military pressure does not bring back the hostages,\" he said. \"And in some cases, the other way - it kills them. It kills hostages.\"\n\n\"To my opinion, unfortunately, if we keep on just with those raids and attacks, I think we're going to see more hostages dead.\"",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nHome equity borrowers should closely analyze and compare current rates on HELOCs and home equity loans before formally applying. Getty Images\n\nWhen borrowing money, the interest rate on the product in question is always a top concern. Unfortunately, in the economic climate of the last few years, rates haven't been particularly advantageous. Whether you were looking for a mortgage, personal loan or just needed a new credit card, the interest rate you were offered was likely much higher than it would've been if you had applied earlier in the decade. While rates on home equity borrowing products weren't immune from this trend, thanks to the home in question functioning as collateral, lenders typically offered lower rates on home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).\n\nAnd that's been particularly pronounced in early 2025, as rates on both products continued the downward trend they started in 2024. Before getting started with either product, however, interest borrowers should know what to look for – and how to compare – their HELOC and home equity loan rate offers now to find the most cost-effective and secure option. Below, we'll break down what to consider now.\n\nStart by seeing what home equity loan rate you'd qualify for here.\n\nHow to compare HELOC and home equity loan rates now\n\nHere are three ways in which homeowners should compare HELOC and home equity loan rates in today's economy:\n\nUnderstand the rate structure\n\nRight now, rates on home equity loans and HELOCs are both competitive, with the former sitting around 8.37% and the latter at 8.03% (for qualified borrowers). But only one of those will be poised to exploit interest rate cuts to come. That's because a HELOC has a variable rate that has declined for existing borrowers multiple times already this year and could continue to fall further should additional interest rate cuts materialize.\n\nHome equity loan rates, meantime, are fixed and will need to be refinanced (and closing costs will need to be paid) for borrowers to take advantage of that new lower rate. Understanding the structure of both products, then, can help interested borrowers understand why HELOC rates are lower than home equity loans now. But it can also help borrowers better determine which is the more appropriate option for their current financial circumstances.\n\nSee how low of a HELOC rate you'd be eligible for here.\n\nLook at the recent trends\n\nHome equity loan and HELOC interest rates have both declined over the past year, approximately, but the trends aren't identical. Home equity loan rates aren't even down a full point as they were 9.08% in January 2024 and are 8.37% now. HELOC rates, however, have already hit 18-month and two-year lows in 2025 and are around two points lower than the approximate 10% they were in early 2024. So if you're singularly focused on securing the lowest rate available now (but still want to be positioned to take advantage of additional declines ahead), a HELOC may be the better option.\n\nBe realistic about the future\n\nAs tempting as it may be to automatically pursue the lowest interest rate now, home equity borrowers should be especially realistic about the future of the rate climate. HELOC rates can rise as easily as they can fall and any number of economic impacts can change that downward trajectory.\n\nHome equity loans, while slightly more expensive now, could become the less expensive option in the future should HELOC rates be impacted by negative economic news (although home equity loan rates could be driven by those developments, too). So be realistic about where rates on either could be headed. It may not be worth the short-term savings a HELOC can provide now if those rates reverse course later this year or in 2026 (they change monthly for borrowers).\n\nThe bottom line\n\nInterest rates on HELOCs and home equity loans are low now and could become even lower in the near future, giving homeowners in need of extra financing something to contemplate. By understanding the rate structure of each, however, and by reviewing recent trends and being realistic about where those trends are headed long-term, homeowners can better choose a home equity borrowing option that is affordable for their budget now and will remain so long into the typical 10- or 15-year repayment period.\n\nLearn more about borrowing your home equity online now.",

        "title": "Trump finds new target in crusade against judges: Nationwide injunctions",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — President Trump has made no secret of his disapproval of a federal judge who temporarily blocked his administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being gang members under a 1789 law.\n\nWhile the president's crusade has included calls for the judge, James Boasberg, to be impeached by the House, Mr. Trump and his administration are also taking aim at a form of judicial relief that has temporarily impeded implementation of his second-term agenda and also been a headache for his predecessors in the White House.\n\nKnown as nationwide or universal injunctions, at least a dozen of these orders have been issued by judges overseeing the more than 100 cases challenging the policies rolled out by Mr. Trump. District court judges have temporarily blocked the president's effort to ban transgender people from serving in the military, his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship and the administration's mass firings of federal probationary workers, among others.\n\nIn other instances, including the president's attempt to invoke the wartime Alien Enemies Act to remove certain migrants, judges have issued temporary restraining orders that prevent enforcement of a policy, typically for 14 days, to allow for further proceedings.\n\nFaced with these injunctions, many of which have been appealed, Mr. Trump and senior White House officials are now calling on Congress and the Supreme Court to take action to limit the ability of federal judges to issue orders that block policies nationwide.\n\n\"STOP NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,\" the president wrote Wednesday on Truth Social. \"If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!\"\n\nStephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, suggested that the administration's goal is to force action that ultimately curtails these orders.\n\n\"Our objective, one way or another, is to make clear that the district courts of this country do not have the authority to direct the functions of the executive branch. Period,\" he told Fox News in an interview Thursday.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller talks to reporters outside the West Wing in Washington, D.C., on March 19, 2025. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nWhen pressed on whether the administration is seeking broad change that restricts a district court's ability to block any executive branch policy, Miller said that \"complete and permanent relief is what this administration seeks.\"\n\nHow injunctions work\n\nTypically in the judicial system, courts focus on resolving the legitimate claims brought by the parties before them. While different courts may reach different outcomes, the broader legal questions can percolate before the Supreme Court may ultimately step in with a resolution.\n\nBut in the current landscape, there are many legal battles brought by many different litigants. In some instances, judges are issuing far-reaching orders that extend beyond the parties and bar the government from enforcing the policy at issue against anyone, anywhere in the country.\n\n\"Whatever your politics, we can agree that having all of these really important policy questions and legal questions resolved in whatever court somebody can first convince to offer nationwide relief is not the best way to run the system,\" said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. \"But fixing it in a balanced and nuanced way probably requires legislation.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is not the first to complain about nationwide injunctions, and Mr. Trump is not the first president to have his policies derailed by them.\n\nA study published in the Harvard Law Review last April found that at least 127 nationwide injunctions were issued from 1963 through 2023. Building on a dataset from the Justice Department, researchers identified 96 that had been entered by judges since 2001. Sixty-four of those temporarily blocked policies issued in Mr. Trump's first term, while federal judges issued 14 nationwide injunctions in challenges to President Joe Biden's proposals through the end of his third year in office. Miller himself repeatedly touted injunctions against Biden administration policies that the legal group he led obtained.\n\nWhen looking at the judges who entered these orders, the study found that of the 64 nationwide injunctions imposed during Mr. Trump's first term, 92% came from judges appointed by Democratic presidents. For Biden, all of the 14 injunctions were issued by Republican-appointed judges.\n\n\"It's a broader trend. It has affected administrations of more than one party, and it will affect the next Democratic administration as well,\" Adler said.\n\nMr. Trump's condemnation of nationwide injunctions has sparked interest from Congress. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, said he plans to introduce legislation to restrict district judges' ability to issue them.\n\nA bill from Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican, would also restrict federal judges' authority to impose nationwide injunctions. An amendment to his proposal that was approved by the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month would allow the broad orders in some instances, such as in cases brought by multiple states if they're heard by a three-judge district court panel.\n\nBills reforming nationwide injunctions have also been introduced by Democrats. In 2023, Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii proposed requiring cases that seek nationwide injunctive relief to be heard by the federal district court in Washington, D.C. Another plan, from Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, would require civil suits seeking nationwide orders to be filed in district courts with at least two active judges, an effort to prevent so-called forum shopping, where plaintiffs go looking for a friendly judge who is guaranteed to take a case in a certain district.\n\nThe House and Senate Judiciary Committees also held hearings on the topic in 2017 and 2020, respectively.\n\nInjunctions at the Supreme Court\n\nAt the Supreme Court, several justices have taken note of the uptick in nationwide injunctions.\n\nIn its last term, during arguments over the availability of the abortion pill mifepristone brought by a group of anti-abortion rights doctors, Justice Neil Gorsuch lamented what he said is a \"rash\" of these broad orders.\n\n\"This case seems like a prime example of turning what could be a small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule or any other federal government action,\" he said during arguments last March.\n\nIn that dispute, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, issued a sweeping order that suspended the Food and Drug Administration's 2000 approval of mifepristone. The high court last year rejected a challenge from the anti-abortion rights doctors to reinstate more stringent rules for obtaining the drug, preserving access to it.\n\nIn 2022, Justice Elena Kagan spoke out against the ability of a single judge to stop implementation of a policy across the country.\n\n\"In the Trump years, people used to go to the Northern District of California, and in the Biden years, they go to Texas,\" she said, referring to where challengers filed their lawsuits. \"It just can't be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process.\"\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas also questioned district courts' authority to enter universal injunctions in 2018, when the Supreme Court upheld the travel ban Mr. Trump implemented in his first term.\n\n\"If their popularity continues, this court must address their legality,\" Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion.\n\nThe high court was recently given the opportunity to address the lawfulness of nationwide injunctions, when the Biden administration filed a request for emergency relief in December and suggested it settle the question of district court's entering preliminary relief on a universal basis.\n\n\"Universal injunctions exert substantial pressure on this court's emergency docket, and they visit substantial disruption on the execution of the laws,\" then-Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in a filing. Quoting Gorsuch, she wrote that the \"'patently unworkable' practice of issuing universal injunctions has accordingly persisted.\"\n\nBut the high court declined to do so.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is taking its turn in urging the high court to resolve the fight. In requests for emergency relief stemming from three district court injunctions blocking the president's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the orders harm the courts and the government.\n\n\"Government-by-universal-injunction has persisted long enough, and has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks,\" she wrote. \"It is long past time to restore district courts to their 'proper — and properly limited — role … in a democratic society.'\"\n\nThe Supreme Court is unlikely to decide whether to grant the administration's request to narrow the scope of the injunctions until early April.",

Venezuela on Thursday flew home a planeful of its citizens from Mexico, most of them U.S.-bound migrants whose journey came to a premature end as Washington cracks down on undocumented immigrants. PEDRO MATTEY/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMr. Trump alleged the deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. He labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on March 15 when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any non-citizen during wartime. A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.\n\nTren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade.\n\nThe Trump administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.\n\nCBS News obtained a list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador last weekend aboard those three flights. U.S. officials have said 137 of them were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.\n\nDocuments obtained by CBS News showed that at least one of the men deported, a 26-year-old barber from Venezuela, has no criminal record in the U.S., and Venezuelan officials said he has no record there either.\n\nMaduro's government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.\n\nIn recent weeks, some 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nThe Trump administration said that the Venezuelans sent to Guantanamo are members of Tren de Aragua, but offered little evidence to back this up.",

        "content": "The Trump administration will be revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of Latin American and Haitian migrants welcomed into the U.S. under a Biden-era sponsorship process, urging them to self-deport or face arrest and removal by deportation agents.\n\nThe termination of their work permits and deportation protections under an immigration authority known as parole will take effect in late April, 30 days after March 25, according to a notice posted by the federal government.\n\nThe move will affect immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who flew to the U.S. under a Biden administration program, known as CHNV, that was designed to reduce illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border by giving would-be migrants legal migration avenues.\n\nA total of 532,000 migrants entered the U.S. under that policy, which was paused soon after President Trump took office, though it's unclear how many have been able to secure another status that will allow them to stay in the country legally.\n\nCBS News first reported in early February that the Trump administration was planning to revoke the legal status of individuals who entered the U.S. under the CHNV process.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said it will seek the arrest and deportation of those subject to the policy change if they fail to depart the U.S. in the next 30 days. Officials are urging migrants to use the newly repurposed CBP Home smartphone app to register for self-deportation.\n\nBut DHS said it retains the authority to target migrants who arrived under this program before the 30-day period lapses. Officials say those prioritized for arrest will include migrants who have failed to apply for another immigration benefit like asylum or a green card.\n\nIn a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the migrants allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV process were \"loosely vetted,\" and argued the program undercut American workers.\n\n\"The termination of the CHNV parole programs, and the termination of parole for those who exploited it, is a return to common-sense policies, a return to public safety, and a return to America First,\" McLaughlin added.\n\nFriday's announcement is the latest effort by the Trump administration to discontinue humanitarian-based immigration programs that allow migrants to enter or stay in the country with the government's permission.\n\nThe CHNV program in question was hailed by the Biden administration as a successful policy that reduced illegal border crossings by migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and, to a lesser extent, Venezuela. But Republicans denounced it as an effort to circumvent the limits Congress placed on legal immigration, and noted that the program had some recorded instances of fraud.\n\nThe Biden administration last fall made a decision not to allow CHNV beneficiaries to renew their two-year work permits under the program, saying they could apply for other benefits, like asylum and Temporary Protected Status. That prospect, however, changed dramatically when Mr. Trump took office.\n\nHis administration has already announced plans to phase out the TPS programs for Haitians and Venezuelans. It also suspended all pending immigration benefit applications filed by those who arrived under CHNV, citing concerns about fraud and vetting.",

        "title": "Louisiana's congressional map returns to Supreme Court to face review",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — The Supreme Court is set to consider Monday whether to leave in place Louisiana's congressional map that includes two majority-Black districts and was used in the 2024 elections.\n\nThe dispute is the latest involving claims of racial gerrymandering and the drawing of political districts to land before the high court following the re-crafting of voting boundaries after the decennial census. In this case, the plaintiffs, who identify themselves as non-African American Louisiana residents, say the state relied too heavily on race when drawing a second majority-Black district for the state's congressional map.\n\nThe Supreme Court has in recent years weakened the Voting Rights Act, starting with the landmark 2013 decision that gutted the law's preclearance requirement. Before that decision, certain states and localities — mostly Southern — with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices were required to submit changes in election law to the Justice Department for approval before they could be implemented. The court ruled that the formula used by the Voting Rights Act to determine what states and localities were subject to Section 5 was unconstitutional because it was based on electoral conditions in the 1960s and 1970s, rather than on contemporary circumstances, and thus imposed unequal burdens on some states without sufficient justifying evidence.\n\nBut in a surprising decision in 2023, the high court declined an invitation to reshape Section 2 of the landmark voting law and invalidated Alabama's congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers after the 2020 Census.\n\nThe latest case before the court involves Louisiana's congressional map, which was redrawn last year to add a second majority-Black district to comply with Section 2, but then was found to be a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race.\n\n\"What we're looking at is the decision on how you draw districts to comply with the VRA and at the same time, not violate the 14th Amendment's ban on drawing districts based on race, where race is used excessively,\" Jeffrey Wice, a professor at New York Law School who is an expert in redistricting, said.\n\nThe dispute, he said, \"is a conflict of different issues coming to us at a time when the court is highly politicized.\"\n\nThe case has ping-ponged around the federal courts, including twice at the Supreme Court, since 2022, when a federal district court in Baton Rouge issued the first decision in this long-running dispute. The judge, Shelly Dick, found the original map of Louisiana's seven congressional districts that was enacted by the legislature in February 2022 likely violated Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength.\n\nThat initial map from the GOP-led legislature had one majority-Black district. African-Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.\n\nThe judge blocked the state from conducting congressional elections under those lines and ordered the state to put in place a remedial plan with two majority-Black House districts. A federal appeals court then upheld that injunction and set a deadline for Louisiana to draw the new voting lines.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry, who took office in January 2024, called the legislature into special session to draw a new congressional map, with the understanding from state lawmakers that two of its seven districts had to be majority-Black.\n\nThe plan adopted reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to adhere to the district court's order and bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state officials said. But Louisiana state lawmakers said they had another goal: to protect certain Republican incumbents, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Whip Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, they said.\n\nIt did that at the expense of Garrett Graves, a Republican who represented District 6 and was at risk of losing his seat because of the redrawn lines. The new district has a Black voting age population of roughly 51%. It stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast, and connects predominantly Black populations from Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge.\n\nShortly after the new redistricting plan was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged that the redrawn District 6 was a racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nA divided three-judge district court panel in Shreveport found that the legislature predominantly considered race when it crafted the new voting lines and blocked the state from using the map in any election. But Louisiana lawmakers, along with a group of Black voters and nonprofits who challenged the original map from 2022, asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the state to use the plan for the 2024 elections.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted the state and Black voters' emergency relief, and the November House elections were held using the redrawn map. Graves opted not to seek reelection, and Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, won the race for District 6. The high court agreed to take up the case in November.\n\n\"The court has faced this issue several times before,\" Wice said. \"But here we have a uniquely different case because we're looking at Louisiana trying to do three things.\"\n\nThe first is to comply with the courts, the second is to draw a second minority district that would allow Black voters to elect their preferred candidate, and the third is to satisfy political demands to keep certain members of Congress in office, he said.\n\nIn filings with the Supreme Court, Louisiana officials argue that the non-Black voters who challenged the new congressional map did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing, because they failed to show how they were harmed by the alleged violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nBut as to the merits of the case, the state and voters said race was not the sole factor involved in how the map was redrawn. Instead, Louisiana lawmakers said they had two criteria: that District 6 be majority-Black and that the broader congressional map protect Republican incumbents.\n\nThe state said the blame for its considerations of race when drawing the new map lies with the district court, since it said the remedial redistricting plan had to have two majority-Black districts to comply with the federal voting rights law.\n\n\"Having forced the state into adopting a second majority-Black district, the federal judiciary cannot wash its hands of the matter now and point at the legislature,\" Louisiana officials said. \"If a bank robber holds a gun to a teller's head, no one would say that the teller's emptying the cash drawer was self-motivated. Just so here.\"\n\nIn their filings, Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court to provide a \"clear articulation\" of what voting map would survive review under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, and how states can avoid \"endless litigation\" that follows every Census moving forward.\n\nThey also suggested that the Supreme Court rule that racial gerrymandering claims shouldn't be decided by the courts at all and should instead be left to the political branches. The proposal, which Louisiana officials said \"would be the best outcome for everyone,\" reflects a concurring opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas last year in a redistricting case from South Carolina.\n\n\"Drawing political districts is a task for politicians, not federal judges,\" Thomas wrote. \"There are no judicially manageable standards for resolving claims about districting, and, regardless, the Constitution commits those issues exclusively to the political branches.\"\n\nNo other justice joined Thomas' opinion. But whether any other of the other justices, namely the members of its conservative wing, come out in agreement with Thomas in this case remains an open question.\n\nSarah Brannon, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said during a call with reporters that if at least four other justices embrace Thomas' position, it would set a bad precedent going forward.\n\n\"It would make it very difficult for civil rights groups, minority voters, to bring claims in the future to raise concerns that state legislatures are using race in a way that is intended not to help Black voters have more opportunities to elect candidates of choice, or voters of color to have opportunities to elect candidates of choice, but to essentially manipulate race in such a way that would deprive voters,\" she said.\n\nOn the other side, the group of 12 non-African-American voters argued that the state set a \"racial quota\" of two majority-Black districts out of the state's seven House seats.\n\nDistrict 6, they argued in Supreme Court filings, is a \"sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district based on racial stereotypes, racially 'balkanizing' a 250-mile swath of Louisiana, from the far Northwest near Texas, down to [East Baton Rouge] near the Mississippi River's mouth.\"\n\nThey also rejected the state's suggestion that the drawing of district lines be solely left to the political branches.\n\n\"The state's 'odious' stereotyping of citizens based on race (even to the 'shame' of many legislators and to Republicans' political detriment) and its tenacious efforts to freeze the gerrymander for the 2024 election show why the political process is insufficient to protect citizens against invidious discrimination,\" the voters said.\n\nA decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nElon Musk’s role in slashing federal government staffing and budgets as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency continues to draw backlash, as nearly 90 Tesla showrooms across the United States face demonstrations Saturday in the fifth week of the “Tesla Takedown” movement.\n\nThe demonstrations, according to the Tesla Takedown website, want people to “sell your Teslas” and “dump your stock,” as a way of reprimanding Musk, who owns a sizable stake in the electric vehicle maker.\n\nThe Tesla Takedown movement was kickstarted by Hollywood actor and filmmaker Alex Winter and Joan Donovan, an assistant professor of journalism and emerging studies at Boston University. There are now local organizers in about 28 states and Washington, DC, and the Tesla showrooms have drawn a growing number of demonstrators, who have carried signs like “Honk if you hate Elon” and “Sell your swasticar.”\n\nTesla did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nDOGE has not slowed down in its sweeping efforts to dismantle or overhaul federal agencies. On Monday, the department attempted to shut down the United States Institute of Peace, an independent nonprofit agency, and CNN reported on March 13 that DOGE had proposed cutting 20% of the staff at the Internal Revenue Service by May 15.\n\n“There’s no walk of life that DOGE doesn’t touch,” Donovan told CNN. “That’s reflected in the diversity of people that come to these protests.”\n\nA demonstration that began at about 11 a.m. ET outside a Tesla showroom in Rockville, Maryland, drew a crowd of over 400 people — roughly the same attendance as last week but a sharp uptick since the start of the campaign, according to demonstrators who spoke to CNN.\n\nOne of the demonstrators in Rockville was Karen Metchis, a 72-year-old former employee at the Environmental Protection Agency. Metchis told CNN the demonstration was much larger than the first one she attended in Rockville. She said it’s important for the public to see a movement, even if there is no immediate impact on Musk and President Donald Trump.\n\n“It lets the public know that they’re not alone in their feelings and hopefully it builds a mass movement where it’s just not tenable for (the Trump’s administration) to continue doing what they’re doing,” she said.\n\nMike Murray, who works in public relations, said it was his first time attending a demonstration at a Tesla showroom. He called the demonstrations an example of “the American spirit at work.”\n\nGlenn Popson, a 54-year-old who works in the tech sector, said Tesla drivers selling their vehicles and Tesla shareholders selling their stock will help convince Musk that Americans’ rights should be protected.\n\nMusk, the world’s richest person, owns about 411 million shares of Tesla, or a 13% stake in the company. He told employees Thursday in a meeting that was broadcast on his social media platform X to “hang on to your stock.” Shares of Tesla (TSLA) peaked at $479.86 on December 17 but have since seen a 48% decline, closing at $248.71 on Friday.\n\nFrom March 1 to March 16, Tesla vehicles from model year 2017 or newer made up 1.4% of overall trade-ins — more than triple the rate (0.4%) for March 2024, according to data from automotive site Edmunds.\n\n“It shows that we’re getting to him,” said Popson.",

Trump said he wouldn’t show such plans “to anybody.” Pentagon officials also resoundingly dismissed the reporting on social media. Musk did meet with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth for over an hour Friday.\n\nThe Defense Department is the latest government arm to announce it will use polygraph tests on employees. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said earlier this month her department will continue the practice after reports she directed polygraphs in the department to include a question about leaks to the media. She said she still believes there are leakers within the government, and they should “be held accountable.”\n\n“We have identified two leakers of information here at the Department of Homeland Security who have been telling individuals about our operations and putting law enforcement lives in jeopardy. We plan to prosecute these two individuals and hold them accountable for what they’ve done,” Noem said in a video on X earlier this month.\n\nThe Department of Justice on Friday announced its own probe into “the selective leak of inaccurate, but nevertheless classified” information related to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\n“We will not tolerate politically motivated efforts by the Deep State to undercut President Trump’s agenda by leaking false information onto the pages of their allies at the New York Times,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement on Friday. “The Alien Enemies Proclamation is supported by fact, law, and common sense, which we will establish in court and then expel the TDA terrorists from this country,”\n\nCNN’s Haley Britzky, Donald Judd and Christian Sierra contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nMaribel Gardea spent years trying to convince Texas’ San Antonio Public Schools that her 14-year-old son, who has cerebral palsy and is non-verbal, needed an eye gaze device in the classroom.\n\nShe sat in many meetings with staff members, including the district’s technology expert, pleading for the device that would allow her son to communicate through eye movements instead of using a mouse or keyboard.\n\nThe district remained unconvinced until she invoked the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, she said. The federal law, enforced by the US Department of Education, guarantees free public education for disabled children and protects Individualized Education Programs, which are tailored to their unique needs.\n\nLast year, the district finally purchased the eye gaze device, she said, and staff began working closely with her son as he used it.\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order kicking off the process of eliminating the Department of Education – a move that could have potential consequences for parents like Gardea.\n\nWhile entirely shuttering the department would require an act of Congress, the president directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities,” the executive order reads.\n\n“The experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars — and the unaccountable bureaucracy those programs and dollars support — has plainly failed our children, our teachers, and our families.”\n\nThe Department of Education provides more than $15 billion annually to help serve 7.4 million students through the IDEA.\n\nLeft to right, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appear during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on February 26, 2025, in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nA day after signing the executive order, Trump announced the Small Business Administration would take over the department’s student loan portfolio, while the Department of Health and Human Services would handle special needs and nutrition programs.\n\nGardea worries that if the Department of Education closes, parents of disabled children will lose federal funds and protection and enforcement of their educational needs.\n\nIt’s a fear parents of children with special needs across the country have expressed since the Department of Education announced last week it was cutting its workforce by nearly 50%. The staff reductions are the first step in shutting down the 46-year-old agency, McMahon has said.\n\nGardea called the move to close the department, “disheartening.”\n\n“It really says a lot about our country,” Gardea said. “It says a lot about how we care for our children no matter their race, what their limitations are, what their disabilities are and how this isn’t a priority for our president.”\n\nA barrier to justice\n\nWhen parents of disabled children are unable to resolve issues with a school district or state, many resort to filing complaints with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, advocates said.\n\nBut that division was hit hard by layoffs, with the Trump administration closing seven of its 12 regional offices.\n\nOne employee, who asked not to be named, told CNN the moves “completely halt the vast majority of cases that we can take in, evaluate and investigate.”\n\nKeri Rodrigues, co-founder of the National Parents Union and a mom of four boys with special needs, said she fears dismantling the Department of Education and its civil rights office will mean parents have nowhere to turn when schools don’t treat their children fairly.\n\nMany families can’t afford to hire a lawyer and file a lawsuit in federal court if they suspect a school is violating the law, Rodrigues said.\n\nShe recalled a time when she filed a complaint with the Department of Education because her 6-year-old son, who has autism, was constantly being suspended from school and staff ignored his Individualized Education Program. But before the department could intervene, the school district addressed Rodrigues’ concerns, she said.\n\nRodrigues called the Trump administration’s plan to dissolve the federal office that investigates discrimination complaints in schools “utter nonsense.”\n\nLeaving it to the courts will delay the process of reaching a resolution with schools, she said.\n\n“What is going to happen is only the parents that have the privilege, that have the resources and have the agency to be able to file federal lawsuits, are going to be able to get justice for their kids,” she said. “There will be millions of children … that are going to be in danger and at risk as a result of this.”\n\nDemonstrators gather outside of the offices of the US Department of Education in Washington, DC, on March 13, 2025, to protest mass layoffs and budget cuts at the agency. Bryan Dozier/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKaty Neas, CEO of The Arc, an organization advocating for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, said the Department of Education has not only offered crucial oversight of school districts but also provided families with recourse when their children are denied an education.\n\nNeas cited an example from 2018 during the first Trump administration when the agency determined that Texas had failed to properly evaluate disabled students and had illegally capped the number of students eligible for special education services.\n\nConcerned teachers\n\nNeas said the Department of Education also plays a role in training special education teachers and provides guidance to schools on innovative methods for teaching disabled children.\n\n“I think this is such a bad idea,” Neas said of the plan to shutter the agency. “Education is really a core function in our country. And our workforce depends on educated students.”\n\nThe Department of Education helps ensure equality for all school children regardless of their race or disability, said David Johns, CEO and executive director of the National Black Justice Collective.\n\nWith the downsizing and looming closure of the agency, more students will “have their disabilities undiagnosed and as a result of that unmet,” he said.\n\n“We should expect the assurances that have been provided to students and families to no longer exist,” Johns said.\n\nExecutive Director of the National Black Justice Coalition, David Johns, speaks onstage during the NBJC Equity March on June 15, 2024, in Washington, DC. Brian Stukes/Getty Images\n\nHe said he hopes the civil rights and faith communities can come together to support disabled families when they are being underserved by school districts and states.\n\n“We are equipped to make a way,” Johns said.\n\nSpecial education teachers are also concerned about how their classrooms will be impacted.\n\nJennifer Graves, a special education teacher and executive vice president of the New Haven Federation of Teachers in Connecticut, said the Department of Education helps fund many special accommodations for disabled students, such as paraprofessionals, assistive technology, and accessible playground equipment for children in wheelchairs.\n\nGraves said school districts would have to compensate for the potential loss of federal funding, which could only delay the process of getting services to students.\n\n“Parents are going to get frustrated, and we might see more legal matters,” Graves said. “Because students aren’t going to be receiving the services they need in an appropriate amount of time.”\n\n‘It’s game on’\n\nKasey Dudley, a New Jersey mom who has an autistic son in 7th grade, said she believes the Trump administration is slashing the Department of Education without realizing the impact on American families.\n\n“Listen to those on the ground,” Dudley said. “Listen to parents, listen to those who have the real-life experience. And it’s not about whose side you’re on, it’s about what’s in the best interest of the children.”\n\nStill, parents tell CNN that despite the threats to end a critical federal agency, they will not stop advocating for their children.\n\n“I think this is the beginning of a war,” Gardea said. “If you’ve ever met a special needs mom who fights for her child, it’s game on.”\n\nCNN’s Sunlen Serfaty contributed to this story.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel, who also serves as acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives, has outlined plans to move as many as 1,000 ATF agents to the FBI, cutting ATF’s agents by more than a third, three people briefed on the plan told CNN.\n\nThe move represents a major cutback of the ATF, an agency that long has been in the crosshairs of gun rights groups that believe its work infringes on 2nd Amendment rights. The ATF has about 2,600 agents and more than 5,000 employees, a number that has remained largely unchanged for years.\n\nThe move is expected to begin with the reassignment of a couple hundred ATF agents to border-related criminal enforcement duty as FBI agents, one person briefed on the matter said.\n\nBut eventually as many as 1,000 ATF agents would be given temporary reassignments as FBI agents, though with no end date for the reassignment, the person said.\n\nA spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the Justice Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump chose Patel to overhaul the FBI, which has just under 14,000 agents and 38,000 employees. Patel was later announced as the acting ATF director. Getting ATF directors confirmed in the Senate is often a difficult task, in both Democratic and Republican administrations. The prospect of Patel running both agencies stoked speculation over whether Trump plans to merge at least part of ATF with the FBI.\n\nThe idea of merging at least part of ATF into FBI or other agencies isn’t a new one. Previous administrations have considered it. Joe Biden as vice president floated the idea in discussions about a task force that was set up to tackle mass shootings and gun crime in the Obama administration.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nKim Haberly’s dark blonde hair hangs behind her shoulders away from her face. Her almond-shaped eyes are faintly ringed by the yellow tone of an almost-healed bruise. There are two thumb-sized divots next to her hairline (barely perceptible until she points it out) from her recent temple lift, a cosmetic surgery that lifts the outer brow. Ironically, her swollen face looks plump and round despite her partial buccal fat removal — a procedure that extracts the soft pads of tissue found inside the cheeks to create a slimmer face. Still, she could pop to the store without raising so much as an eyebrow from on-lookers.\n\nIt’s not until Haberly turns her face to the right and raises the camera close to her ear, displaying two freshly sutured incisions, that you might suspect she is fresh out of a facelift.\n\n“I’ve woken up really swollen today because I slept on my side,” Haberly told CNN over a video call from her hotel in Turkey. Last month, Haberly traveled over 7,700 miles from her home in Perth, Australia to receive one of the most invasive facial surgeries available: a deep plane facelift. The advanced lifting technique — which has become a favorite of specialist surgeons for its apparent longer lasting results — not only repositions the top layer of skin (known as an endoscopic facelift) but also the complex network of tissue and fibrous muscles below.\n\nAt 37, Haberly, who also had a neck lift operation, is almost a decade more junior than the youngest average facelift candidate in Australia, and in the eyes of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), is at least a whopping 18 years ahead of schedule.\n\n​​It’s not a rejuvenation strategy. It’s a beautification strategy. Dr. Zelken, certified plastic surgeon\n\nTraditionally used to reduce signs of aging, the facelift is often associated with those in later life. In the US, almost 60% of facelift patients in 2023 were aged between 55 and 69, according to ASPS. Similarly Generation X, which encompasses those aged from 45 to 60, were the primary age group seeking out facelifts in Australia that same year, research from the Australasian College of Cosmetic Surgery and Medicine shows. And although there is no published data on the average age of a facelift patient in the UK, the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) recently reported the procedure is “more common among those 50 and above.”\n\nYet, in the last few years, an increasing number of younger people have been seeking out the surgery — not as an anti-aging method but to finesse their features, having grown up in an extremely digital world where their physical appearances are constantly on show. According to the ASPS, the number of facelift patients in 2023 aged between 20-29 and 30-39 each jumped by 7% compared to the previous year, while those from the 40-54 age group grew by just 3%.\n\nLeft: Kim Haberly before her deep plane neck and face lift. Right: Haberly healed post-operation. @iamhotblonde\n\nDr. Jonathan Zelken, a board-certified plastic surgeon based in Newport Beach, California, who has performed a number of facelifts, has found that some of his clients in their 20s and 30s “want sharper jaw lines, sharper cheeks, sharper brows,” he told CNN over the phone. Rather than eliminate wrinkles, their goal is to enhance their existing appearance, Dr. Zelken explained. “​​It’s not a rejuvenation strategy. It’s a beautification strategy.”\n\nMainstream appeal\n\nThe first known facelift was performed at Berlin’s Charite Hospital over 120 years ago. In 1901, an intrepid German doctor called Eugene von Holländer was approached by a Polish aristocrat looking for smoother skin. With her hands clasped to the sides of her face, the well-to-do woman is said to have demonstrated her request by lifting the corners of her mouth and cheeks. But Holländer was initially reluctant to operate, given that no such operation existed. Ultimately, as he recorded in his 1912 medical paper, he fell victim to “the art of feminine persuasion” and readied his scalpel. While there is little public information about patient zero, including her name, Holländer’s notes of her “aging wrinkles” and “drooping cheeks” suggest she was around the age of a prototypical candidate.\n\nOver a century later, the surgery is breaking new ground once again. This time, with those under 40. It’s a controversial procedure, but Dr. Zelken is largely in support of the newfound interest from this burgeoning demographic, whose operations have produced some of his “favorite” results.\n\n“It’s almost like you are doing a filter for social media in real life by doing these procedures,” said Dr. Zelken, who was hesitant to share the cost of his work, but pointed to Southern California’s ballpark range of $30,000 to $100,000 per facelift. While he acknowledged that a 20-something year old looking for a facelift would be a “yellow flag,” he wouldn’t be deterred solely on that. “It’s hard to put an age minimum on this procedure,” Dr. Zelken reasoned. Even where there are no drooping cheeks or aging wrinkles, “you can achieve really attractive change,” he said.\n\nI really wanted to enhance myself, just to feel good about myself again Emily Cipryk, facelift patient\n\nThat’s also the opinion of some facelift patients. Emily Cipryk was 28 years old when she flew from Toronto, Canada to Istanbul, Turkey for a deep plane mid-facelift — a procedure that raises the tissue and skin around the corner of eyes as well as cheeks. “I really wanted to enhance myself, just to feel good about myself again,” she told CNN on a phone call. Cipryk’s previous job in financial technology during the pandemic meant she was on Zoom calls for hours a day, with her face constantly reflected back at her. “I partied a lot, from university until my late 20s, and it caught up with me… I just didn’t look good,” she said.\n\nCipryk received a total of six surgeries at once, including a blepharoplasty, lip lift, a rhinoplasty and partial buccal fat removal, which cost a total of €13,000 (about $14,140). The process was entirely financed by her fiancé, who also traveled with her to Turkey. “I did six procedures at once so I could just get it all done,” said Cipryk. She noted that she was “very happy” with the results.\n\nWhile Cipryk’s procedures went well, she cautioned others to “be careful” when selecting a surgeon in Turkey. “People get ahead of themselves and think, ‘Oh, it’s so cheap, I can afford it.’ And they might go to someone who’s not even a real plastic surgeon,” she said. “I’ve heard of people going to a real estate agent to get a hair transplant (because) they’re not doing their research.” In 2023, the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons published a joint statement with the Turkish Society of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons warning of a rise in “serious complications and even deaths” linked to the “significant increase in numbers of patients travelling abroad for aesthetic plastic surgery.”\n\nEmily Cipryk had a mid-facelift at 28. Dr. Şamil Yazgan-Renate Clinic\n\nHer facelift was one of six surgeries, including a blepharoplasty and rhinoplasty. Dr. Şamil Yazgan-Renate Clinic\n\nOnline pressures\n\nUsing plastic surgery to maintain a youthful and symmetric appearance is not a new concept. Cosmetic procedures were first popularized in the early 20th century by Hollywood actors concerned with enhancing their on-screen appearance. But with the advent of social media and and the popularization of selfies, the pressures once reserved for those on the world stage now affect many individuals.\n\nCatherine*, a 33-year-old from Southern California, spends much of her time on Instagram and TikTok. “I’m watching videos of girls who are in their early 20s that are Instagram influencers and also celebrities who get the best work done,” she told CNN over a phone call. “So, you’re looking at all these people who are a lot younger and they’re perfect, and you’re really chasing that, even though that’s maybe not attainable for the average person.”\n\nFor Haberly, the desire for a facelift was partly born out of the rapid weight loss she achieved through semaglutide injections, which led her to drop about 15 pounds. Around three years ago, she started to notice loose skin around her jawline and began using sports tape — designed to support muscles and ligament injuries — to hide these areas.\n\nIt also didn’t help that as part of Haberly’s job as a hair colorist, she would often film her clients’ coloring sessions and post them on Instagram. Despite not being the focal point of the video, Haberly would often receive disparaging comments such as “You look haggard, you look old.” Haberly recounted: “That was probably more when the camera was lower. I would always know when I was going to get those (comments) because I could see myself when I posted that video.”\n\nUltimately, Haberly opted to undergo a facelift surgery, as she hoped it would “help the longevity of my career, which is really important.”\n\nHow young is too young?\n\nSome surgeons are more wary of operating on younger patients.\n\nHaberly initially struggled to access the type of facelift she wanted in Australia — a country which requires a psychiatric test prior to a consultation with a cosmetic surgeon. She passed her mental health checks but was warned by local doctors on having a drastic procedure at her age. One surgeon offered an alternative, less invasive option that involved repositioning the skin rather than removing it entirely.\n\nHarberly was recommended by another doctor to wait until she was 50 for a facelift — but she didn’t want to reverse the clock, she wanted to pause it. “I want it now while I’m traveling the world and I’m out there and my face is everywhere,” she said. A similar sentiment was shared by Naomi*, a 45-year-old patient of Dr. Zelken’s who had a deep plane facelift last year. “I want to enjoy it now,” she told CNN. “I don’t want to wait until things get worse and worse… Let’s get ahead of it.”\n\nIn 2023, the number of facelift patients in the US aged between 20-29 and 30-39 each jumped by 7% compared to the previous year. photo illustration by CNN/Getty Images\n\nI don’t want to wait until things get worse and worse… Let’s get ahead of it. Naomi*, facelift patient\n\nOn why a facelift appealed to her, Catherine explained: “I went through eight years of school plus grad school. I think the stress starts to show on you.” She added that she also felt insecure about some “asymmetry” caused by a medically necessary neck operation in her 20s, and after years of consistent Botox and laser therapy, she wanted “something that was 100% guaranteed to give me a result.”\n\nCatherine’s operation, which took place at her local clinic and included a lower face and deep plane neck lift, as well as the extra expense of overnight monitoring from a nurse, cost between $25,000 and $30,000.\n\nHowever, there’s reason to be cautious, according to Dr. Kelly Killeen, a board-certified plastic surgeon based in Beverly Hills. “The older population, they’re looking at the surgery because they want to restore something they had in their youth. Whereas younger people are sometimes chasing something that doesn’t exist,” she told CNN over a phone call.\n\nFace-tuning apps play a role in this, Killeen explained, pointing to facial laxity — a term used by surgeons to refer to looser skin — as an example that may seem unappealing but is expected with daily movement and neck function. “It doesn’t feel normal (to younger patients) because with the way people edit their photos and shoot their videos, you can’t sometimes see that celebrities have laxity in (physical) areas (that) bend,” explained Killeen, pointing to the neck and jaw as examples.\n\nHaberly flew over 7,000 miles from Perth, Australia to Turkey for her surgery. @iamhotblonde\n\nHealth and safety\n\nWhether young facelift patients encounter greater risks than those in their 50s and 60s is disputed from surgeon to surgeon. In Dr. Zelken’s view, surgery complications such as nerve damage or muscle paralysis could be felt more deeply by a younger patient, as opposed to someone older.\n\nI remember saying to my mom, ‘What if I die from this pain?’ Kim Haberly, facelift patient\n\nOne disadvantage of starting young is the higher likelihood of repeat operations, warned Californian surgeon Dr. Carl Truesdale. “Someone who is searching for a facelift when they’re younger are less tolerant of age in their face, so they’re going to be more sensitive to seeing age in their face when they’re older, right?” he said.\n\nThe more surgeries that are performed over a lifetime, the higher potential there is for traumatized tissue, Dr. Truesdale added, noting that revision operations are inherently more challenging. He estimated that last year he turned down facelift operations for around 50 people under the age of 40, with the reason that they “don’t need it.”\n\nDetermined to undergo the procedure, Haberly eventually scheduled a virtual consultation with a doctor in Turkey, communicating with a receptionist via Whatsapp and sending through photos of her face, pinching her skin and moving her head as directed. Her surgeon in Istanbul then sent through a procedure plan along with the price — $19,425 — and she flew overseas.\n\nWhen Haberly woke up the day after her surgery, the sensation in her body was unbearable. The swelling and bruising she went on to experience was underestimated by doctors, who weaned her off pain medication prematurely, leading to “excruciating pain” as a result, she said. “For two days straight, I was shaking (and) trembling,” Haberly recalled. Watching the clock on the hospital wall in a foreign country, minutes seemed to stretch into hours. “I remember saying to my mom, ‘What if I die from this pain? What if this pain never goes away?’” she said.\n\nBy day five, Haberly didn’t require any more pain relief. “I’d never recommend anyone do this. But you know, pain becomes distant,” she said. “I can see how happy I’m going to be with the results.”\n\n*Patients have requested for their names to be changed.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nJames Boasberg wasn’t supposed to be famous.\n\nAs the chief judge for the federal court in Washington, DC, Boasberg is well-liked in wonky legal circles and in the courthouse community. He’s a former law school roommate of Brett Kavanaugh and his personality has poked through his rulings with quirky uses of Star Trek quotes and Fugees lyrics.\n\nEven with 23 years as a judge in DC, Boasberg is very far from a household name.\n\nThat all changed last week when Boasberg was randomly assigned a case that put him at a loggerheads with President Donald Trump and his administration’s efforts to use colonial-era laws and send undocumented immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nHis attempts to reign in Trump administration officials who appeared to violate his orders with controversial deportation flights to El Salvador earned him the unwanted position of being the target of Trump’s red-hot fury. In a series of social media posts, Trump smeared Boasberg as a “Radical Left Lunatic Judge” and called for his impeachment, drawing a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nYou wouldn’t know it from Trump’s angry reaction, but plenty of Boasberg’s past rulings and actions have actually aligned with the president’s political interests.\n\nBoasberg was known for giving lenient punishments to January 6 rioters. In Trump’s first term, he released FISA court materials that exposed huge problems with the FBI’s probe into connections between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia’s election meddling. He also paved the way for conservative groups to obtain some of Hillary Clinton’s emails from her private server.\n\nHe’s also currently presiding over another high-profile and consequential federal cases: the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against Meta, the parent company of Facebook.\n\n“Boasberg is the opposite of a radical judge,” one former Justice Department prosecutor, who tried several January 6 cases in front of Boasberg, told CNN. “He was always fair and principled. You knew when you went into court with him, that he was going to follow the rules. He was very predictable because he followed the law. He is not a rash judge at all.”\n\nTrump all week has complained about Boasberg, calling him “a Grandstander, looking for publicity,” and saying Friday in the Oval Office that he’s “sitting behind a bench and has no idea what’s going on.” The militant rhetoric from senior Trump officials about disregarding Boasberg’s orders and in-court stonewalling from Justice Department lawyers have raised the specter of a brewing constitutional crisis.\n\nTrump says he sees the moment as a crisis as well – but one of Boasberg’s making, and it’s endangering American lives. Other White House aides said Boasberg was leading “the gravest assault on democracy” and that he committed an “egregious abuse of the bench.”\n\nIn some ways, the controversy isn’t really about Boasberg. It’s Trump who has a history of bashing any judge that rules against him – and praising anyone that rules in his favor. And as often happens amid these disputes, pro-Trump influences have followed up his public outbursts with increasingly personal attacks about Boasberg’s family and doxing-esque details about his home in DC.\n\nStill, it’s not every day that the chief justice speaks out to defend a single lower-court judge. Even after Roberts’ public consternation, Trump continued attacking Boasberg and some House Republicans filed articles of impeachment that will likely go nowhere.\n\nBut their ire is perhaps misplaced.\n\nSources told CNN that they’ve never seen Boasberg as a partisan actor. He has handed down plenty of Trump-favorable rulings. Boasberg, 62, was appointed to the DC district court by President Barack Obama and was previously named to DC’s local courts by President George W. Bush.\n\n“Remember who becomes federal judges – people who are willing to take a tenfold pay cut to spend the rest of their lives resolving impossible legal questions,” said CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams, who clerked for two federal judges. “It’s just not a community that seeks out the spotlight. I don’t think there’s a federal judge in America who relishes being tweeted about.”\n\nLike most judges, Boasberg rarely speaks to the press and does not comment about cases. When he took the reins as chief judge in 2023, after his colleague Beryl Howell stepped aside, Boasberg emphasized that they prefer to work quietly, behind the scenes.\n\n“Neither of us will be Time’s person of the year,” Boasberg told CNN at the time.\n\nDecades of public service\n\nAccording to Boasberg’s official biography, he is a DC native and graduated from an Episcopal college preparatory school for boys. He played college basketball at Yale while getting an undergraduate degree in history and later graduated from Yale Law School.\n\nHe eventually joined the Justice Department and prosecuted homicide cases in DC.\n\nBush appointed him in 2002 to be a judge on the DC Superior Court, which is essentially the state-level trial court for local DC cases. Obama elevated him in 2011 to serve on the DC District Court, which handles criminal and civil cases in DC’s federal jurisdiction.\n\nThe Senate confirmed Boasberg to his current court in a bipartisan 96-0 vote.\n\nAmong the notable Republicans who voted for Boasberg are current Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Senate Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, and former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nHe became the chief judge for the DC district court in 2023.\n\n‘He follows the law’\n\nAs the chief federal judge in DC, Boasberg presided over secret grand jury matters that impacted the special counsel investigation into Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election. He most notably ruled in 2023 that former Vice President Mike Pence must testify to special counsel Jack Smith’s grand jury, providing key firsthand evidence against Trump.\n\nLike his colleagues on the bench, Boasberg has also seen his fair share of cases against individual January 6 rioters, including members of the far-right Proud Boys extremist group.\n\n“He is principled and fair,” one former Justice Department prosecutor told CNN. “He is widely respected in the community for making principled decisions based on the facts in each case. He’s great to practice in front of, because he follows the law and the rules.”\n\nOne January 6 defendant, Jonathan Munafo, who pleaded guilty to assaulting police, publicly said he expected a “Boasberg discount” at sentencing, because of Boasberg’s reputation for handing out lenient punishments. (Munafo got nearly three years in prison.)\n\nWilliam Shipley, a conservative lawyer who has represented dozens of January 6 rioters, posted Sunday on X that, “Boasberg is easily in the top 1/2 of the most lenient sentencing judges, and possibly among the top 1/3,” among the judges who sentenced his clients.\n\nShipley – who supported Trump’s mass pardons for nearly all charged rioters – said he was defending Boasberg from “100% false” attacks levied by prominent members of the January 6 support groups whose claims about Boasberg went viral.\n\nAfter a Supreme Court ruling that an obstruction charge couldn’t be used in January 6 cases, Boasberg even reduced the prison term of one Proud Boys member who had called him a “clown” and a “fraud” at his original sentencing, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOther big cases: Clinton, Russia, Facebook\n\nHe is currently presiding over one of the most consequential digital monopoly cases: the Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit against Meta. He has rejected attempts by Meta to dismiss the case, which is set to go to trial next month.\n\nAt the behest of a conservative legal group in 2016, Boasberg ordered the State Department to release some of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails from her controversial private server, but also dismissed other lawsuits seeking more disclosures.\n\nHe rejected a longshot lawsuit to force the IRS to release Trump’s tax returns in 2017.\n\nCNN previously reported that, while Boasberg presided over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, he encouraged the declassification of information related to the Trump-Russia probe. Trump and top Republicans have celebrated these disclosures.\n\nThese and other materials revealed systemic errors and sloppiness in the FBI’s efforts to wiretap a former Trump campaign aide in 2016 and 2017 who had strange Russian ties.\n\nPersonality pokes through\n\nWhile getting his law degree at Yale, “Jeb” Boasberg lived in a house with future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and six other law students. (He graduated in 1990.) CNN has reported that the group is still close and takes annual trips together.\n\n“Jeb is so social,” Amy Jeffress, a prominent defense lawyer in DC, told CNN in 2023.\n\nMost judges do not have a physical presence around the DC courthouse, let alone walk around the building each day. But Boasberg enters the courthouse most mornings greeting security, court staffers and lingering reporters with a smile. Most days, he could also be spotted during the lunch hour, running to an off-site lunch or picking up takeout.\n\nOn the day in August 2023 when Trump was arraigned at the DC courthouse for his federal election subversion indictment, CNN spotted Boasberg making the rounds both inside and outside, talking with reporters about the events for the day. The chief judge’s presence was similar to that of a local mayor, shaking hands with everyone as he walked around.\n\n“The first thing that comes to mind is – he was always fair,” a former courthouse employee said about Boasberg, adding that the chief justice was also always “approachable.”\n\nThe former employee added that Boasberg was always willing to listen to an argument before coming to a decision – not just with attorneys regarding a case, but with courthouse staff on administrative matters as well – because he was determined “to do what was best for the court.”\n\n“He wasn’t one of those (judges) that had to have his way all the time,” the employee said.\n\nAt a tense court hearing Friday, Boasberg pledged to “get to the bottom” of whether Trump administration officials violated any of his order, and said the implications of Trump’s unprecedented use of a 1798 law to hasten the deportations was “awfully frightening.” He also spoke out about the importance of credibility to upholding the rule of law.\n\n“I often tell my clerks before they go out into the world that the most valuable treasure they possess is their reputation and credibility,” Boasberg said.\n\nCNN’s Katelyn Polantz, Tierney Sneed and Emily R.

        "content": "CNN —\n\nA 12-year-old student is facing a hate crime charge in juvenile court after allegedly being part of a group that attacked twin seventh grade Muslim students at their middle school in Waterbury, Connecticut, authorities said Friday.\n\nThe girl allegedly involved in the altercation was charged with intimidation based on bigotry and bias in the first and second degree through a court-issued summons to juvenile court.\n\n“Investigators determined that the altercation was motivated by religion and/or ethnicity, meeting the legal definition of a hate crime,” according to a joint statement by the Waterbury State’s Attorney’s Office, Waterbury police and city officials.\n\nThe twin 13-year-old girls had their hijabs pulled off and were kicked and punched in the girls’ locker room during their gym period, according to Farhan Memon, chair of the Connecticut chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations.\n\n“They were beaten up by two of their classmates,” Memon said. “One girl had bruises on her face and her sister had something held against her neck.”\n\nOne of the girls felt something slide across her neck, resulting in an abrasion on her neck, Memon told CNN. The girls’ father took them to the hospital where doctors documented bruises and scrapes to the face, nose and neck, Memon added.\n\nAnother student involved “was referred to a youth diversionary program as an alternative to arrest, based on her involvement in the incident,” the city said in its statement.\n\nIt’s unclear if the two juveniles have appeared in juvenile court, or if they have legal representation.\n\nWaterbury Public Schools Interim Superintendent Darren Schwartz in a statement said the incident is “an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to ensure our students are safe and respectful of one another.”\n\nThe incident, which unfolded during Ramadan, the Islamic holy month, comes as Muslims report a record-high number of anti-Arab and Islamophobic bias in the United States.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations in its annual civil rights report released last week said it received 8,658 complaints of Islamophobia last year – the highest number ever recorded by the organization.\n\nThe twins’ family contacted CAIR one day after the locker room attack, leading to the nonprofit’s involvement in the situation, Memon said.\n\nWhile Waterbury Mayor Paul Pernerewski said the attack at the middle school was an “isolated incident,” CAIR says it wasn’t the first time the twins – who immigrated with their parents to the US from Egypt last year – had faced bullying from their peers over their religion and ethnicity.\n\n“Although the sisters are not fluent in English, they confirmed that in the weeks leading up to the incident, students—including the girls who allegedly assaulted them—used terms such as ‘Arab,’ ‘Muslim,’ and ‘Hijab’ while laughing and making gestures at them,” CAIR wrote in a letter to officials on March 18.\n\nJust days before the locker room attack, the twins had reported threats by the same student who has since been charged in the attack who allegedly “dragg(ed) her finger across her neck in a death sign,” according to a letter sent by CAIR to city officials.\n\nCNN has reached out to Waterbury Public Schools for comment.\n\nPolice originally investigated the incident as a disturbance or assault, but the family later provided more information alleging their daughters were the victims of a hate crime, leading to a “thorough” investigation of the claims, according to the police department.\n\n“Every student deserves to feel secure and respected in their learning environment, and we will continue to work closely with our school partners to uphold that standard,” Waterbury Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo wrote in a statement.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nA Colorado business owner called her immigration attorney in a panic this week, wrestling with a worry she never expected: If she travels abroad for a conference, could she end up getting deported?\n\nA woman from Cameroon who lives in the Midwest made a heartbreaking decision: Flying home for her father’s funeral would be too risky.\n\nAn immigrant of Palestinian descent cancelled international travel plans — and worried that walking outside their New England home with a keffiyeh they’ve worn for years might no longer be safe.\n\nAnd a Canadian tattoo artist who lives in Washington state shared her fears on social media about an upcoming trip across the border.\n\nThese four people have never met, and many details of their lives are different. But they share at least one thing in common. They are legal immigrants with green cards — documents deeming them lawful permanent residents of the United States. And they told CNN they’re still scared the Trump administration could kick them out of the country.\n\nImmigration lawyer LaToya McBean Pompy says this growing fear is the biggest issue she sees among her clients who have green cards.\n\n“They’ve never been afraid before,” she says, “but today, they’re afraid.”\n\nWhy some green card holders say they’re worried\n\nAbout 12.8 million green card holders live in the United States, according to the latest estimates from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics.\n\nAnd some of them were taken by surprise when authorities detained a former student protest leader at New York’s Columbia University earlier this month. Mahmoud Khalil, who helped lead the school’s student protest movement demanding a ceasefire in Gaza, is married to a US citizen and had a green card. He isn’t facing any criminal charges, but Trump administration officials have accused him of inciting violence and supporting terrorism – claims Khalil’s attorneys and supporters deny.\n\n“I think the fact he happened to be a permanent resident underscored the vulnerability of all non-citizens in this country to a lot of people who hadn’t thought it through,” says David Leopold, an immigration attorney in Ohio and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nActivists hold a rally and march through downtown Chicago to show support for Mahmoud Khalil on March 11. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nLeopold says it’s not uncommon for green card holders to be detained and deported if they’re accused and convicted of certain crimes.\n\n“It’s fairly routine,” he says, noting that the statute lists offenses such as document fraud, drug offenses and crimes that are deemed “aggravated felonies” in immigration law.\n\nWho’s next? Is it a climate activist? It is a gender-rights activist? Is it trans activists? Is it somebody who is concerned about health care? Is it somebody who just simply opposes Donald Trump? David Leopold, immigration attorney\n\nBut the Trump administration’s attempt to deport Khalil under the portion of the statute that cites “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States” is far rarer and more troubling, Leopold says.\n\n“Who’s next?” Leopold told reporters on a recent call with immigrant rights advocates. “Is it a climate activist? It is a gender-rights activist? Is it trans activists? Is it somebody who is concerned about health care? Is it somebody who just simply opposes Donald Trump?”\n\nEven before Khalil’s high-profile arrest, many green card holders were wrestling with fears they weren’t expecting, McBean Pompy says.\n\n“I think it had to do with ICE and enforcement activities that folks were seeing and posting about that were happening in their communities,” she says.\n\nRecent comments from officials like Vice President JD Vance have sparked even more concern, she says.\n\n“A green card holder, even if I may like that green card holder, doesn’t have an indefinite right to be in the United States of America, right?” Vance said in an interview with Fox News last week. “American citizens have different rights from people who have green cards, from people who have student visas. And so my attitude on this is, this is not fundamentally about free speech. And to me, yes, it’s about national security, but it’s also, more importantly, about – who do we as an American public decide gets to join our national community? And if the Secretary of State and the President decide, ‘This person shouldn’t be in America, and they have no legal right to stay here,’ it’s as simple as that.”\n\nA green card holder, even if I may like that green card holder, doesn’t have an indefinite right to be in the United States of America. U.S. Vice President JD Vance in a recent interview with Fox News\n\nMcBean Pompy, who’s based in White Plains, New York, and frequently posts her analyses of immigration issues on social media, shared a clip of Vance’s remarks with her followers, describing the vice president’s comments as “a shocking new standard.”\n\n“When our policymakers speak about this issue in such a loose way, it makes me a little uncomfortable,” she told CNN, “because there are very strict rules governing a green card holder’s rights and abilities in the United States, and I just want to make sure that we’re following due process.”\n\nThey’re scared about upcoming travel plans\n\nMarina Sinden, a green card holder in Washington state who’s married to a US citizen, is looking forward to visiting her family in Canada for Easter. But the 37-year-old tattoo artist says she’s not looking forward to what she fears might happen when she tries to return to her US home afterward.\n\n“I’m really concerned about making the crossing back into the United States. … I have an entire world here to lose if I’m not allowed to re-enter,” Sinden says.\n\nEscalating tensions between the US and Canada, plus a recent report of a Canadian woman who was detained at the border for 12 days, are weighing on her.\n\nI’m really concerned about making the crossing back into the United States. … I have an entire world here to lose if I’m not allowed to re-enter. Marina Sinden, a green card holder in Washington state who's planning to travel to Canada soon\n\n“I’m very concerned about going through an experience like that,” Sinden says. “I own a home here. I own a brick-and-mortar business. I have vehicles. I have children in school. And I have a daughter who says the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States flag every single day.”\n\nSinden says she worries a clerical error in her file from a past green card application could cause confusion, even though she resolved that problem in court, her current green card is valid and she has no criminal record.\n\n“I’m concerned that no matter what I’ve done to do the right things (and) respect the rules… I could have my entire life taken from me for a clerical issue … where something was misfiled one time incorrectly,” she says.\n\nMarina Sinden says she has a green card, but still worries she could be detained by US immigration officials. Courtesy Marina Sinden\n\nThe stress is something that’s difficult for those who haven’t dealt directly with the US immigration system to understand, says Maria, a 38-year-old business owner in Colorado. She asked to be identified only by her first name out of concern that speaking out could jeopardize her legal status in the US.\n\nMaria told CNN she came to the US from Costa Rica when she was 5 years old. She has a green card now, but as a child she was undocumented for years after her family overstayed their visas.\n\n“I remember feeling like we couldn’t go to the doctor, we couldn’t go do anything, because the fear of deportation was so real,” she says. “It’s terrible, and now, oh my God, all my childhood traumas and fears are being reignited and lived again — something I never thought I’d have to deal with ever again.”\n\nAm I still scared? Yes. Maria, a green card holder in Colorado whose attorney advised her that traveling abroad is safe\n\nThis week, as she prepared to put down a deposit to attend an important work conference abroad, Maria called her lawyer. Even with the green card she’s had for years, the situation feels increasingly uncertain, she says.\n\n“He told me, ‘It’s fine, you’re OK, you can go,’” she says. “But am I still scared? Yes.”\n\nWhat immigration attorneys are telling clients about travel\n\nFor immigration attorney Charles Kuck, it’s a telling sign of the times. The last time he received so many calls from concerned legal residents, he says, was after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.\n\nIn recent weeks, Kuck says he’s been fielding numerous calls from clients with green cards — and working to reassure them.\n\n“Green card holders should be fine,” Kuck says. “Unless they’re engaging in activities that (Secretary of State) Marco Rubio would consider to be terrorism, I think they’re absolutely OK. And that’s the vast majority of people.”\n\nCommercial trucks head towards the US Customs and Border Protection Pacific Highway Port of Entry from south Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, November 26, 2024. Jennifer Gauthier/Reuters\n\nGreen card holders largely have the same rights as US citizens, he says, “unless — and there’s always an unless — they’ve committed a crime. If they’ve committed a crime, then they do not have the right to re-enter the United States without being subject to being questioned and maybe put into deportation proceedings.”\n\nThey also don’t have the right to live indefinitely outside the country, he says.\n\nGreen card holders should be fine. Unless they’re engaging in activities that (Secretary of State) Marco Rubio would consider to be terrorism, I think they’re absolutely OK. And that’s the vast majority of people. Charles Kuck, immigration attorney\n\nMcBean Pompy says she advises green card holders not to stay outside the US longer than six months. If they do, she says, it’s possible for the US government “to allege that they have abandoned their residency.” Also, green card holders who are in removal proceedings shouldn’t travel, she says. And she advises clients not to sign any documents at the airport, especially if they don’t understand them.\n\nLeopold says the advice he’s giving to clients varies depending on their circumstances. He’s advised many visa holders to hold off on travel, particularly given the possibility that new travel bans are coming soon from the Trump administration.\n\n“If I were not a citizen, I would think long and hard before I traveled. And that includes green card holders. It’s less of a risk, obviously, for a green card holder to travel, because you do have more rights with the green card, and it’s much harder to keep a green card holder out of the country,” he says. “But anybody who’s got blemishes on their record, a conviction, even misdemeanor convictions, they should not travel unless they’ve talked to counsel.”\n\nA vehicle is pictured at the US Customs and Border Protection – Derby Line Port of Entry at the Canada-U.S. border between the U.S. state of Vermont and the Canadian province of Quebec. Carlos Osorio/Reuters\n\nTo some, even staying in the US doesn’t feel safe\n\nDeciding it wasn’t safe to leave the US and attend her father’s funeral in Cameroon a few weeks ago was heartbreaking, a 40-year-old green card holder in the Midwest told CNN this week.\n\nOn top of her grief, watching recent news and social media posts on her phone has left her feeling devastated and uncertain about her life as an immigrant in this country, she said.\n\n“When I got my green card, I thought everything was going to be OK for me. … Lately, with all that’s been going on, I don’t even know,” the woman said. She asked to be identified only by her first initial, L, because she came to the US seeking asylum and is worried speaking out could endanger her family.\n\n“When we see what is happening, the number of people that are being deported, it’s really scary for us,” L said.\n\nDemonstrators hold signs outside of the Rhode Island State House to protest the deportation of doctor and Brown University assistant professor Rasha Alawieh on March 17. US Customs and Border Protection said Alawieh had attended the public funeral in Lebanon of Hassan Nasrallah , the long-time leader of Hezbollah, and a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson alleged she expressed support of Nasrallah to CBP officers. Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n\nAfter Khalil’s recent arrest, a green card holder of Palestinian descent told CNN they’re feeling worried about walking outside their New England home wearing a keffiyeh — let alone traveling internationally. They asked to be identified by the initial K out of fear that speaking out could jeopardize their immigration case.\n\n“I can’t even be guaranteed that in my home an agent won’t come in and forcibly remove me because the President or the Secretary of State deems someone a threat … It’s really hard to feel safe when that’s what we’re being told,” K said, adding that reports of other arrests and deportations have only intensified fears.\n\n“And I think the intent was fear,” K said. “That was very much intentional — to have people afraid to speak out, to have people afraid to exercise the freedoms that are rightfully theirs to take part in.”\n\n‘You will see a lot more people applying for citizenship’\n\nIn addition to questions about whether they can safely travel and whether their green cards can be taken away, immigration attorneys say these days they’re also getting more questions from green card holders about becoming US citizens.\n\n“I think you will see a lot more people applying for citizenship than might normally have applied,” Kuck says.\n\nOfficials estimate that more than two-thirds of the almost 13 million green card holders in the US are eligible to become citizens.\n\nBut despite their eligibility, some of her clients are more hesitant now to pursue citizenship, McBean Pompy says.\n\n“They’re making a decision — ‘OK, I’m going to wait and see how things shake out with this administration before I really try to move forward with it,’ because they don’t want to be caught up in any of the major changes,” she says.\n\nImmigrants wait for a naturalization ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 11. Attorneys say they expect more people to apply for citizenship amid growing uncertainty. Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nMaria, the Colorado business owner, says now it feels like becoming a citizen is the only way to keep her family safe and make sure her 12-year-old son doesn’t have to deal with the same worries she faced as a child. Soon she’s planning to begin the paperwork.\n\n“I don’t want to be separated from my family,” she says.\n\nSinden says she sees things differently. She considered becoming a US citizen before. And she’ll be eligible to apply this month. But escalating tensions with her home country, she says, have made her feel so unwelcome in the US that becoming a citizen now feels like a step too far.\n\n“I don’t believe in the current policies and the aggression towards my country. I don’t know how far that’s going to go,” she says.\n\nSo instead of taking steps toward US citizenship, Sinden is opting for something even more permanent than a green card.\n\nShe recently tattooed a Canadian maple leaf on the palm of her hand.\n\nCNN’s Jennifer Hauser contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Gaza’s fragile ceasefire was shattered early Tuesday as Israel carried out what it described as “extensive strikes” on Hamas targets in the enclave.\n\nThat day was Gaza’s deadliest in more than 15 months, according to a CNN count, with Israel’s overnight bombardments striking multiple locations across the territory. More than 400 people were killed, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\nThe next day, the Israeli military launched a ground offensive. It said it had retaken the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land that splits Gaza in half, dividing Gaza City and northern areas from the southern parts of the Strip that border Egypt.\n\nIsrael and Hamas began a ceasefire on January 19, with the first phase lasting 42 days. The two sides were meant to discuss a second phase starting February 3, but the Israeli government ignored that deadline and it has been clear that the two sides are oceans apart in negotiations.\n\nIsrael blames the new fighting on Hamas for refusing to accept revised ceasefire terms. Hamas, in turn, has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of unilaterally upending the truce and putting hostages “at risk of an unknown fate.”\n\nHere are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.",

But what does this mean for their long-term health? Sanjay sits down with Dr. Cara Natterson , a pediatrician and expert on adolescent health, to discuss the implications of early puberty, what's driving the shift, and what anyone with a young person in their life needs to know to navigate this crucial time.\n\nDownload Transcript Episode Transcript\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:00:00 You know, I have to tell you, as a parent, something I think about a lot is how to have real, authentic conversations with my three teenage daughters. It can be hard sometimes. I realize that things are different for their generation. They have smartphones and screens and influencers. There is news that is constantly blaring everywhere. It's a different time. And a lot has changed right down to our biology. Take, for instance, puberty. It's one of the most awkward and yet important stages of growing up. But even that has changed. The average start of puberty in the United States now begins at eight years old for girls and nine for boys. Some kids are going through puberty even earlier than that. It also last much longer than it did before. For some people, puberty can last for up to a decade. Just think about that. All of this might come as a surprise to you.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:00:58 People know a lot about the puberty they went through, but it is not the same now.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:01:05 That's doctor Cara Natterson. She's a pediatrician and she's a parent. She's author of the New York Times bestselling series for girls called The Care and Keeping of You. She also has a sequel for boys called Guy stuff. She's an expert on puberty, so I decided to sit down to talk to her and try and learn. Why are kids going through puberty earlier, and is that early puberty really the new norm? I think most importantly for me, as a dad of three teenage girls, what do parents need to know about how to help their children navigate it? I'm Doctor Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, and this is chasing life. So if you're a parent and I'm just guessing we're around the same age because I know you have two college athletes who are teenagers still, I think, or maybe early 20s, and I have three teenagers. So right around that same age, the way that we think about puberty is parents. But even I think as physicians may be totally different than than what our kids are going through. You're a pediatrician, so you obviously have updated knowledge, but for me, as just a dad, it's a totally different thing compared to 30, 40, 50 years ago.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:02:25 Even up until the late 1990s, we were all taught in medical school that puberty begins around 11 or 11.5 and it takes about two, three, four years. It's a sprint and you get through it and it's super awkward and your body changes and then you're done. That was sort of the teaching and the medical school more detailed teaching was not a whole lot more detailed. It was that the path through puberty were these stages called the Tanner stages. And Tanner looked at breast development. He looked at penile and testicular growth, and he looked at hair growth. And he did these studies in the 1940s and 50s and 60s. In an orphanage outside of London. And that's where he collected all of his data. So five stages, Tanner one. Nothing's happening. You're not in it. Tanner five, you're totally done. And two, three and four. That's puberty. Girls go into puberty around age 11. They're earlier kids or later kids. But that was about it. And boys around 11.5 now. And we started to get this knowledge in the late 1990s, when a study was published by a doctor of public health named Marsha Herman Giddens. She published a study, 17,000 girls, that showed, nope, it's not 11 anymore. It's ten. And in fact, if you looked at kids according to their race, kids who are black. Their average age of pubertal onset was even earlier, and we could talk about that study and what that did, but that really rocked the world. And that was more than 25 years ago, by the way. And then more data came out. And Louise Greenspan, with others, published data in 2010 that looked to confirm that original data. And it didn't just confirm it, it moved the starting point even further. So starting in 2010, right, 14 years ago, we knew that the average age of breast development for a girl fell somewhere between 8 and 9 in this country. And for boys, the start of puberty looks like testicular and penile growth, which frankly, most parents have no idea is happening. I did not know it was happening in my own house, because it's when boys tend to get private, but that average age is between 9 and 10. So that's different. That's two years different from when we were growing up.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:04:57 So 11, 11.5 was what the onset of puberty. That's the age that we all sort of learned, at least when we were in medical school. And now it's become younger, maybe even as young as eight. Is that normal puberty now or is that considered early onset puberty or early puberty? How do you refer to it?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:05:18 I love this question because I think definition of terms is the most important starting place. Right. So 8 to 9 is an average. Normal can be earlier than eight for some groups of girls. So as a pediatrician, when I was starting in practice in the year 2000, if a kid had secondary sex characteristics, if their bodies were starting to change, usually it meant breast development. And it happened before age eight. They would come into my office to see me. That was considered atypical or abnormal. Now that post has moved back to seven. So if a kid is younger than seven, they'll come see a pediatrician. But if they're over seven. Most advice is that is within the normal range. Oh, and by the way, if they're 12 and nothing has happened, that is also normal. So now wrap your brain around a 5 or 6 year spread of normal onset of body changes. That's really hard for everyone to manage. And I'll add one more term that's really important. So puberty in its narrowest definition means the path to sexual maturation. So when you start puberty. You cannot be part of a baby making equation, and when you finish puberty, you can potentially be part of making a baby. That's the definition of puberty very narrowly. The broader definition, as we talked about earlier, is all the other downstream shifts from all of those sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen and progesterone floating around the body in the brain? Mood swings, friendships shifts, shifts in the way kids make decisions.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:07:21 I think the point is puberty isn't always straightforward. Things that seem like puberty, using that narrow definition might technically not be puberty.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:07:32 There's this thing called adrenarche that is caused when the adrenal glands release their hormones, DHEA and DHEA s, and these hormones are cousins of estrogen and testosterone. Nostrum. And when the adrenal glands release these hormones, these hormones tell the body to make more sweat and in certain places to make it with greasier thicker proteins and to sprout more hair. Some places it's new hair, some places the hair texture and color changes that sweat hair. You can imagine how body odor and pimples are related. Right? That is not puberty. That's called adrenarche. It happens around the same time as puberty. But in some kids it can happen much earlier. So a five year old can have pubic hair and they're not in puberty. Or a 15 year old can be well through puberty and have no body odor, no greasiness, and no pubic hair growth. It's confusing.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:08:47 Adrenarche and puberty can be totally disparate in terms of is there a relationship at all between. Yes. I mean.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:08:53 Yes, because the hormones are all cousins and they can convert forms. So DHEA and DHEAS can convert into testosterone and forms of estrogen. I should add, people always ask about where body weight fits in. And the answer to that is in many bodies that carry extra weight, they have what what's called peripheral conversion of these hormones. So DHEA and DHEAS when they're floating around, the body can convert more easily into the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone when there's more body fat, which is one of the bridges that connects this, which is one of the reasons why kids who carry extra body weight tip into puberty, typically a little earlier.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:09:45 This is fascinating. And I mean, the question I think a lot of people will ask which are which are addressing here is, is why over the last 30, 40 or 50 years, has puberty become something that is happening younger and younger? I, you know, again, this is just me, me talking here. I had heard about high body weight being a concern because of, as you say, what the added fat might do. I had also heard about potential environmental factors playing a role here, and I'm curious what what your thoughts are on that. But this idea of stress hormones, you know, I think of stress hormones as sort of short acting hormones. The idea that sort of a persistent exposure to high levels, for example, of cortisol, could also be a culprit in tipping people into puberty earlier. I had not considered that.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:10:37 Yeah. So the cortisol is for sure a short acting hormone. But when your adrenal glands are pumping it out 24 over seven. Because you're on social media reacting to what you're seeing, or because you're living in a stressful environment where you're expected to be an academic achiever or an athletic achiever, or if you're living in a stressful environment because you don't know where your next meal is coming from, or you don't know where you're going to sleep that night. So all of these things are what we call stressors. And by the way, there's no value judgment to be placed on which stressor is more or less important. But now you can see why every kid is exposed to stress, quote unquote stress, right? We love to throw around that term. What does it mean? It means anything that tells your adrenal glands to pump out cortisol. And the stressors are there all the time. They're there all the time. When we went to school, we came home at the end of the day, and any dynamic that happened at school was left at school. Maybe someone called us on the corded phone and maybe one of our siblings. Let us take the call. Otherwise they were busy on the corded phone. Right now there is round the clock. Social dynamics. Romantic dynamics. Right. But I don't want to demonize this either. I think it's really, really important to be level about all this. I mean, social media, for instance. For sure. There's a connection here. But social media has also been shown to save lives, to build community for people who are marginalized and don't have it. It's too easy to be black and white about this. And so I think it's very important for us to recognize the role of stress and stressors, but also to recognize that some of the things we call stressors have huge upsides and huge positive benefits. I would never argue that the aces, the adverse childhood experiences that cause stress like food insecurity, financial insecurity, housing insecurity, witnessing violence, living in a traumatic situation. There is no upside to any of those stressors, but a lot of these sort of stressors in lives that are less challenged by ACS have positives and negatives.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:13:07 Stress in and of itself is not the enemy. It's the relentless nature of stress, I guess, is what I'm hearing you say.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:13:14 But I don't want to send people, you know, sort of screaming for the hills and stressed out because it is not a switch which goes from 0 to 100. With puberty. When we were growing up, the path for puberty was fast. Today, even though it's starting earlier, it is actually happening more slowly. So it's not like an eight year old wakes up one morning in the body of an 18 year old. It is not what's happening. What is happening is eight year olds. If their girls might be developing breast buds, they might just have breast buds for a while. It is not like they are going to have their full adult breast size immediately. And this is another thing that is layering sort of the confusion and the, the, the sense of I don't know how to help the kid in my life. Parents don't know how seriously to take any of this. And there's worry. I mean, it's just it's a mess. It's a mess of information that is so easily remedied with just some simple facts. So fact one puberty is starting earlier. Fact two it's going slower. It's going slower. Girls are getting their period a little bit earlier than they used to, but not three years earlier. It's more like somewhere between 3 and 6 months.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:14:42 What about the racial divide? So when you take all these factors that could potentially be causing puberty to happen sooner. Why? Why racial divide?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:14:51 'Every researcher that I trust is landing at the same conclusion, which it's going to turn out not to be race. It's going to turn out to be zip code. So if you take this explanation of cortisol being at the heart of everything that's going on, and you look at the way this country sets up and the socioeconomic divide and the racial divide, it's you can't argue that the two are not completely overlapped. It's a very, very hard to look at the sociological data and say, oh, yes, we can account for racial shifts in puberty separate from zip code, socioeconomic shifts and puberty. So it's kids who are more stressed and more under-resourced, who are entering puberty the soonest. Now everyone's entering sooner. On average, the trend line is down because of something you mentioned earlier, which is these amorphous environmental causes. So the way I would describe that bucket is everything we put into and onto our body is impacting our body. Right? So it's everything from the toiletries, the cosmetics that we use, the shampoos and cleansers and moisturizers. Many, many, many of them contain chemicals in them that disrupt the hormones in our body. They change the way hormones signal. Likewise, the pollution in the air that we breathe impacts the way our bodies work, right? Everything. The water we're drinking, depending upon what's in the food we're eating, what's, you know, antibiotics that are pumped into animals that then end up on grocery shelves. There's tons of data that shows that those antibiotics shift the way our body's immune system works are inflammatory cascade. We have inflammation as a result that has impacts on the sex hormones. So it's a lot of things coming at us. But it's a reminder that there are some really incredible scientists out there who are trying to figure out what are these lowest common denominator chemicals that are showing up in these various environmental insults. We call them insults, right, that are changing the way the hormones work in our body so that we can get rid of them. And that's really important. And right now, the foods that don't have antibiotics are the toiletries Cosmetics that don't have a whole list of chemical ingredients tend to be more expensive. Right? So right. We're back to zip code. We're back to the socioeconomic drivers of puberty. So it's complicated.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:17:35 If you look at the data around the world, do you see differences geographically, by country or culture?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:17:42 Yes. So net net puberty everywhere is starting earlier. And we've known this for a long time. And even in very remote areas we know that puberty is starting earlier. So that's that sort of global phenomenon of what people are putting into an onto their bodies and how chemicals are shifting the path through puberty. But it looks different from country to country and region to region. And the data is kind of all over the map. And in the US we tend to be a little bit on the earlier side. So the data shows our average start of puberty has been consistently at or below the average for the world.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:18:29 So puberty happening earlier isn't just a thing happening in the United States. This is a global phenomenon. But I think the real question then is just how worried should we be about kids starting to develop earlier in life? And if we are worried, when then should we as parents get involved? We'll be right back. When we talk about blue zones and things like that, places where people live better, they live longer lives, they have more social connection. You can see the benefit, and the benefit usually is something like longevity. You live longer, you have a higher health span, things like that. The question that I really sort of struggle with when it comes to puberty is, is puberty starting earlier a bad thing?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:19:21 We have no idea. I mean, because we have no data, right? So people ask this all the time, and the answer is we only have about 25, 26 years of evidence that puberty is really started to march earlier. And so the oldest of those kids are just in middle age now, right, entering middle age. So we don't know. But what we do know is there have been trends through history of when puberty has started earlier, when puberty has started later. We are so sure that earlier puberty is bad. And yet really, if you look back through the lens of history in cultures or in societies where there was no food available, what did those kids bodies do? Their bodies slowed down their development and puberty happened much later, and it makes great evolutionary sense. The whole point of puberty is to be able to be part of a baby making equation. If your body, if you are a female and your body cannot carry a fetus because you're so nutritionally deprived. You don't have the food you need. You don't have the nutritional resources. Well, then why would the body try to develop and get itself there in order to reproduce quickly? There's no rush. So there are times where you look through historical records, and the average age of pubertal onset is 16. And that's because in those societies there was a famine. And so I'm not saying earlier puberty is good. I think we have to put everything in context.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:21:02 But just in terms of mental health risks. I've been reading some about this and how girls starting puberty earlier might come with added mental health risks. Is there evidence of that then? And do we know anything for boys as well?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:21:15 So for girls, the data is pretty clear and it tethers to this early data about earlier puberty, earlier body changes, more sexualization, earlier risk for predation. If your body is changing. No one's talking to you about it, or the world thinks it's happening to you. Too young. So you're not getting informed in a certain way. But then the world is sexualizing you and expects for you to either think like you're older because you look like you're older, or to behave like you're older because you look like you're older. The set up for mental health issues is tremendous, right? Also, the sex hormones, whether they are estrogen and progesterone, which govern female puberty, or testosterone, which governs male puberty, they circle around the brain. They change the way the neurons fire. They change the way moods are expressed. You know, Louise Greenspan says the first sign of puberty is not breast development or penile and testicular growth. It is a slamming door. I love that line. It is absolutely true. And that is where third and fourth grade parents are like, wow, my kid is in puberty. They are slamming the door. I mean, that is all those hormones rising and falling and and coursing through the brain and changing the way the brain feels and the way it reacts. It has to be a set up for mental health issues if we are not talking about it. I will add for boys, there has been no study that looks at testosterone and quiet, but I am 100% convinced that when someone finally studies it, we will see that testosterone surges and drops are what cause the silence of tween and teen boys. We know testosterone causes rage, but the other side of that pendulum swing is silence. And it's not that they don't talk, but they talk less. And then they are rewarded for talking less or. Today's generation of parents goes well that was what I did. And I just shut my door for three years and my parents didn't say anything and was totally fine. And I emerged out the other end, and I'm okay. And that the truth is that was then. This is now that sign that you see in boys where they just become monosyllabic or grunts. It is painful for parents, it is hormonal and there are ways through it. There are conversations you can have with your boys. There are ways to pull them out of their shell. They do emerge out the other side, but they do want to be talked to. I swear. They tell us all the time, just because they're not talking a lot, doesn't mean that they don't want to be included in the conversation.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:24:06 This is so fascinating. I mean, I think anyone listening, myself included, is thinking about those teens in their life, whether their own kids or kids friends. And it tracks. It's so interesting. I mean, it's fascinating. Let me ask you this. So if parents come to you and say that my kid seems to be going through puberty very early. What is the conversation that you'd have with parents?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:24:29 So let's start with this thing. Any adult who thinks the kid in their life is going into puberty and they have a question or a concern, reach out to a health care provider. This is really important. What they need to do is they need to have a conversation, and then they need to do a physical exam, and they need to actually look at your kid. I am a pediatrician. I did not examine my own child. I did not know when my son went into puberty, but it was not my job to be his pediatrician and to examine him and to determine that. So I would take him in for his annual checkup, and if there were any concerns in between, I would take him in. And it was the pediatrician who had the conversation with him and examined him, and then I could pick up the conversation from their. Pediatricians are trained to ask parents to leave the room. By the time a kid is about somewhere 11, 12, 13, 14, they're going to kick the parent out at some point. That's totally appropriate. Then call him up, ask him, or at the end of the visit, pull him aside. Hey, is my kid in puberty or do I need to worry about anything? There are so many ways into the conversation, but hopefully the theme here is coming through that talking about it is the most important thing.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:25:54 Puberty can on average starts around 8 or 9, but it can be 6 or 7, you said. So I have a kid. I think they may be going through puberty at a very young age. Should I be worried about that?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:26:07 So before age seven, for a girl, before age eight for a boy, I would say you would want to bring in medical advice. You start seeing changes in the body. You want to bring in a medical finger, but you noticed I'm not using the word concerned or worried because there are a lot of red herrings here. There are a lot of things that can look like puberty that aren't puberty.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:26:33 But if it is happening before that age, what would the pediatrician be thinking?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:26:37 They're looking for what's called precocious puberty. And precocious puberty is puberty that's happening sooner than it should. And one of the causes of precocious puberty, which is not common, but it's always on the list for every pediatrician, is a tumor that is growing in the brain, that is telling the brain to secrete the hormones called LA and FSH, that tip the body into starting puberty. That's the main thing that people are looking for. It's a tumor that is causing the hormones to release early. But I hesitate to go down that road because more often than not, the concerns turn out to be not a worry, but a great opportunity for conversation with the pediatrician, right? So, for instance, if you have a kid who's carrying extra body weight and you think they're developing breasts and actually it's just fat tissue, and a doctor can examine them and show that it's just fat tissue and there's no breast tissue, it's still a great opportunity for a conversation about nutritional wellness.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:27:43 Right? Right. But what what are some of the approaches that you've implemented as a parent, with all you've known when it comes to talking about puberty?\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:27:53 The best tip I have is what I did with my son, so that my oldest is her daughter, who is just a talker. But my son was not a talker. And when he went through puberty, he became really not a talker. And that was very hard for me. So the first thing I learned how to do was to sit on the other side of a closed door. So I would sit on the other side of my son's door and I would knock on the door and I would say, hey, buddy, I'm actually just sitting on the other side of the door, and I would really love to hear what's going on, and I'm going to be here for about 5 or 10 minutes. And if you want to talk, I'm just happy to sit here and talk. And it's so funny we did. My partner Vanessa and I did a podcast episode with our two sons who were going off to college this month, and there's a part of the podcast where I talk about this with my son, and I'm like, do you remember this? And he's of course, I remember it because it worked. We didn't have to look at each other. We didn't have to. There was no vulnerability. I wasn't there was no worry, you know? He was so aware of me being worried about everything right then. And there was none of that with a closed door between us. And then eventually the door opened. And then my strategy became. And it is still to this day, my strategy. Knock on the door. Always knock. Go in. He was almost invariably sitting at his desk in his chair, and I would go lay down on his bed and look straight up at the ceiling, and I'd be like, hey, then how you doing? And he'd start talking. No eye contact, but my laying on his bed and him sitting in his desk, at his desk, with his back to me, was a place and a way that we could get into some of our best conversations. That is a way of communicating with a kid that works. Everyone says do it in the car. Car is great on a walk. On a walk is great. You're just not making eye contact. So that's what worked for me, and I hope that other people can take that advice, because the parents who taught me that I'm forever grateful.\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta 00:30:03 I get to tell you another piece of crucial advice is to just start having these conversations. Just start talking. Have the conversations. The big ones, the small ones, the silly ones, the serious ones. Because you gotta know this. In this day and age, our kids are exposed to a lot early, and some of what they're exposed to, like it or not, is not what any parent would want.\n\nDr. Cara Natterson 00:30:26 The average age of first porn viewing in this country is 12. Really? Yeah. Wow. And 15% of ten year olds have seen it. So if you're not having conversations like this about all of this smells and feelings and sex and all of it, if you're not having those conversations with the kids in your lives, someone else is. So it's time to get over the awkwardness. Educate yourself. Find your own trusted adult. We always tell kids to find a trusted adult. Adult find your own trusted adult, you know, bounce things off of them, but start having these conversations. They can be short. You can have many of them over many years. You will mess them up, I promise you. That's okay. Take a do over. Come back and say to your kid, you know what? I said that wrong. I want to try again. But it's really, really critical to know that there are information resources out there for them that compete with you. And if you want to be the source of information, it's up to you to do it.",

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe US attorney in Washington, DC, arguing the public needs to know the “truth” about the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., filed a motion to speed up by two years the release of FBI files related to the civil rights icon.\n\nAppearing at the White House on Friday, Trump also referred to sealed files on King.\n\n“They’re going to release everything,” he said.\n\nThe material, sealed since 1977, apparently includes tapes and transcripts of FBI surveillance of the civil rights icon before his death, including unflattering and prurient details about King’s relationships with women that could tarnish the legacy of a man whose image is chiseled in granite in a monument off the National Mall.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, a noted conspiracy theorist, has publicly championed transparency, notably for files related to the JFK assassination, even as his administration has embraced secrecy in its effort to dismantle parts of the federal government. That apparent contradiction raises questions about why the administration wants the MLK files to be released early.\n\nIs it to let the public know what the government knows? Or is it to highlight the human faults of a civil rights icon at a time when Trump’s administration is moving to purge the government of diversity initiatives rooted in the civil rights movement that King championed?\n\nWhile there are serious questions about King’s killing by James Earl Ray, King’s family has opposed early release of the material, fearing it could be used to tarnish his legacy.\n\nI talked to Jonathan Eig, author of “King: A Life,” a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography that looks at King’s accomplishments and his faults. Eig obtained access to some FBI files in writing the book, so I wanted to ask him how he views the prospect of the public having access to tapes of the FBI — on orders from then-Director J. Edgar Hoover and with the authorization of then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy — recording an American hero in order to smear him.\n\nOur conversation, conducted by phone and edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nWhy do the FBI’s MLK files exist?\n\nWOLF: Why does the FBI have files on Martin Luther King Jr?\n\nEIG: Surveillance of King began in the early ‘60s, when the Kennedy administration became concerned that he might have been associating with members of the Communist Party in the United States.\n\nThat surveillance was approved by Robert F. Kennedy, was requested by J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI, and once they began listening to those tapes, it became clear that King wasn’t really involved in anything related to communism.\n\nBut they found the wiretaps of his phones and his associates’ phones useful in that they gathered dirt, basically. They were able to hear King on the phone with women. They treated him as an adversary — somebody who it would help to have to have dirt on.\n\nThat’s why we have transcripts of King’s phone calls and also audio tape of not only his phone calls, but activities in his hotel rooms, because some of the hotel rooms were also bugged.\n\nIs there reason to be skeptical of the most salacious allegations?\n\nWOLF: The National Archives has already released, as part of an earlier dump of JFK-related files, a salacious FBI memo that graphically refer to King engaging in adultery with multiple women. At the same time, there’s this feeling that the FBI may have been engaged in a smear campaign and making things up. Can we believe what’s in these documents?\n\nEIG: I think we can be fairly confident when we read transcripts of phone calls that those are accurate. According to people who’ve read those transcripts, some of the people who were on those phone calls have read the transcripts, people like Andrew Young, people like Bayard Rustin, who, when he was alive, said that the FBI was accurately transcribing their phone calls.\n\nBut we also have to be very skeptical about claims the FBI makes regarding King, because we know that many FBI agents felt like they would gain favor with their boss by smearing King and by painting him in an unfavorable light. So when we see things like memos that are not transcriptions of conversations, or when we see handwritten notes in the margins of memos saying that King was doing immoral things, we have to be much more skeptical. That’s one reason why the tapes would be interesting — because it might help us better understand just how reliable the FBI’s reporting is.\n\nWhat is the Trump administration’s motivation here?\n\nWOLF: Where do you stand on releasing all this stuff, and the tapes, in particular? If they show what some of the things described, it could seriously tarnish his legacy. But at the same time, there’s a desire for transparency and to know what the FBI was doing.\n\nEIG: In general, I am in favor of transparency, and I think we have a right to know how the FBI was treating King. I think that is more important than how King was behaving in his personal life. I don’t really have any opinion on whether it should be released ahead of schedule.\n\nI am concerned that the reason the government wants to release it ahead of schedule is so that they can continue this campaign to attack diversity, attack civil rights, and if the reason they want to speed up the release of these tapes is in order to attack King and to undermine his role as an icon, as a hero. If the goal is to diminish King’s stature, then I think they’re doing it for the wrong reasons.\n\nWhat else is to be learned from the FBI’s files and tapes?\n\nWOLF: In your book, you talk about reviewing a lot of FBI files. Do you think that you’ve seen most of what is under seal, or is there other stuff out there that will come as a shock?\n\nEIG: I think I’ve seen enough to know what else is on those tapes. I think the big issue will be how people respond to hearing King’s voice. And that troubles me. The idea if we have his voice, and we can hear him, even just having conversations that are not flattering, that will be used by certain people to attack King. We really ought to be focused here on the FBI’s behavior, not King’s behavior.\n\nThe FBI actively tried to smear King\n\nWOLF: The FBI wasn’t just gathering surveillance. It was actively involved in trying to smear him. How did that work?\n\nEIG: It worked very well. The FBI was very effective in smearing King, damaging the Civil Rights Movement and making his life miserable. They released the details of his phone calls and his personal life to members of the media, which affected how the media covered King. Even if they didn’t write about his sex life, they were aware of it, and I think that it tarnished his image. The press treated him much more skeptically.\n\nIt also had the effect of dividing members of the Civil Rights Movement. It made it harder for King to work with other activists, because his reputation was under attack, and because he was losing popularity. By 1966, something like two-thirds of all Americans in a Gallup survey said they disapproved of Martin Luther King, so it was making his job much more difficult. It was making him feel lost and at times sad that no one seemed to be listening to him anymore. So I think the FBI’s campaign against King was largely very effective.\n\nHow did King react to being spied on?\n\nWOLF: You write that he knew about it in real time. Did he do anything about it?\n\nEIG: Not much. He did have a meeting with J. Edgar Hoover, but the meeting was fairly nonconfrontational. King waffled a little bit. Some of his colleagues were advising him to be more aggressive and to call out Hoover and to complain publicly about this surveillance. And King did not do that.\n\nNow there’s another new regime at the FBI\n\nWOLF: We’re talking about the FBI spying on Americans and trying to smear them in the 1960s. Now we have a new regime in charge at the FBI, and they are actively looking into President Trump’s political opponents. Do you see echoes of the previous FBI in what we are learning about today?\n\nEIG: I think law enforcement in this country has always been surveilling private citizens. I don’t think there’s anything new in this administration, but I think that what we learned from the King surveillance is that there should be a much higher standard for when the government chooses to invade the privacy of private citizens.\n\nWhy MLK should be viewed as a Founding Father\n\nWOLF: The larger point of your book is that King should be viewed not only as a civil rights icon, but as a Founding Father. You wrote that after knowing all of the stuff that the FBI gathered on him.\n\nEIG: I think King should be recognized as one of our greatest heroes, and his personal affairs should have nothing to do with that. Plenty of our founding fathers, the signers of the Constitution, had affairs. Some of them had affairs with women who they enslaved.\n\nOur heroes are often flawed, but we have to look beyond that. To me, what matters is that King, knowing the government was surveilling him, knowing he was under attack, that he was arrested 29 times, chose to continue this life of service to the public and to sacrifice for what he believed America could be. He believed in the potential of this country, and he was willing to fight for it, even as the even as this country treated him so badly.\n\nWhat about the Malcolm X files?\n\nWOLF: Did I miss anything on this topic?\n\nEIG: I think it would be much more interesting and useful if they released the FBI information on the assassination of Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam at that time. That would be, to me, a better use of the government resources.\n\nWOLF: What do you think we would learn?\n\nEIG: I don’t know, but I think that there are still questions about who was involved in the assassination of Malcolm X; that there are probably answers in some of those files.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nIt was around 4 a.m. when University of Idaho student Dylan Mortensen said she was woken up by strange noises in her off-campus house.\n\nShe and her roommates had returned earlier from a typical Saturday night out in the college town when the sounds spurred a night of terror with a flurry of panicked texts and unanswered calls.\n\nThree of Mortensen’s roommates and a boyfriend of one of the students would be found dead inside the house the next morning on November 13, 2022 — stabbed to death with no signs of a break-in.\n\nDNA from the brutal slayings ultimately led to the arrest of 30-year-old criminology graduate student Bryan Kohberger. A not guilty plea has been entered on his behalf for the murders of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin.\n\nMortensen and another roommate, Bethany Funke, are the only two from inside the three-story Moscow, Idaho, house to survive.\n\nNow, as Kohberger’s trial nears over two years later, the personal accounts and phone activity from the two surviving roommates provide more insight into what they say happened in the early morning hours of the murders as the defense attempts to discredit their testimony and call into question why they waited eight hours to call 911.\n\nCourt documents paint a picture of a night filled with odd sounds, unknown voices, panicked texts, unanswered calls and a shadowy figure in the hallway – all in the setting of a college town that hadn’t experienced a murder since 2015.\n\nNot much is known about Mortensen and Funke, whose phone activity and personal accounts were revealed in court documents in the last several weeks. A wide-ranging gag order in the case prevents them from speaking publicly about their experience.\n\nWhile the defense tries to show through their filings the two surviving roommates spent an inordinate amount of time on their phones before calling 911 – an attempt to call into question their timeline of events – a psychological expert says a multitude of factors could’ve played into this delay.\n\n“When we are faced with trauma or fear, we all have different response systems, and there’s no one right response system,” said Elizabeth Cauffman, a psychological science professor at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nWhile a complete picture of that morning has yet to form, the surviving roommates’ accounts and documentation shed light on what the housemates endured in a case shrouded with mystery and speculation.\n\nHere’s how the night of the murders unfolded, according to court documents:\n\nRoommates return home after a Saturday night out\n\nAfter a busy Saturday night out, the roommates returned to the three-story, six-bedroom Moscow house in the early hours of November 13, 2022.\n\nKernodle and her boyfriend had been at a party at a frat house. Mogen and Goncalves were at a local bar then stopped at a food truck for late-night carbonara before making their way back home.\n\nThe roommates began arriving back home and heading to their rooms in the early morning hours, with Kernodle briefly leaving her room to grab a DoorDash order around 4 a.m., Mortensen and Funke told police, according to court documents.\n\nThe third floor housed Goncalves and her dog in one room and Mogen in another. Kernodle and Chapin were on the second floor, where Mortensen also had a bedroom, according to the affidavit.\n\nFunke was the lone occupant of the first floor, where the front door was.\n\nThe off-campus house where four University of Idaho students were found murdered on November 13, 2022, before it was demolished. Ted S. Warren/AP/File\n\nRoommate on second floor says she heard crying\n\nAround 4 a.m., Mortensen, who shared the second floor with Kernodle, woke up to noises upstairs, telling police she thought Goncalves was playing with her dog on the third floor.\n\nShortly after, Mortensen said she thought she heard Goncalves say “something to the effect of ‘there’s someone here,’” the affidavit says. She looked out her bedroom door but didn’t see anything.\n\nThen she heard crying coming from the direction of Kernodle’s room and looked outside once more, she told investigators.\n\nFrom above, she heard a male voice that wasn’t Chapin’s say something like “It’s ok, I’m going to help you,” according to court documents. It’s not clear where the male’s voice came from.\n\nMortensen heard crying again and opened the door, this time seeing “a figure clad in black clothing” with a mask covering their mouth and nose walking toward her, the affidavit said.\n\nShe froze, Mortensen said, and the person walked past her and to a sliding back glass door, according to the affidavit. She then locked herself in her room.\n\nShe didn’t recognize the man. Mortensen later described him in grand jury testimony as being around her height “or a few inches taller,” having a “lean build” and wearing all black, according to court documents. She also noted in the same testimony she saw one bushy eyebrow. She told police during several interviews after the murders her memory was a bit blurry since she had just woken up and may still have been drunk, according to the documents.\n\nAround 4:17 a.m., a security camera less than 50 feet from Kernodle’s bedroom wall picked up distorted audio of what sounded like voices, or a whimper followed by a loud thud, according to the affidavit. A dog can also be heard barking.\n\n‘No one is answering … I’m freaking out’\n\nAt 4:20 a.m., Mortensen started frantically calling her roommates – Kernodle, Goncalves, a brief 41-second call with Funke, then Kernodle again. She called Mogen again before texting Funke saying, “No one is answering.”\n\nFunke had also tried calling Mogen, Kernodle and Chapin during that time.\n\n“Kaylee,” Mortensen texted Goncalves. “What’s going on”\n\nThe text message remained unanswered. Investigators believe the four roommates were killed sometime between 4 a.m. and 4:25 a.m.\n\n“Ya dude wtf,” Funke replied, with Mortensen describing someone in “like ski mask almost.”\n\nMortensen and Funke, identified by their initials in the court documents, continued texting back and forth about the man in the hall, typos growing more frequent as their panic rose.\n\nBF to DM: “Stfu”\n\nDM to BF: “Like he had [something] over is for head and little nd mouth”\n\nDM to BF: “I’m not kidding [I] am so freaked out”\n\nBF to DM: “So am I”\n\nMortensen indicated her phone was about to die, and Funke texted “Come to my room,” which was below on the first floor. “Run,” she said.\n\nDM to BF: “Im scRwd tho”\n\nBF to DM: “Ya IK but it’s better than being alone.”\n\nThe defense says in court filings Mortensen ultimately went to Funke’s room.\n\nMortensen and Funke launch another round of calls to their roommates at 4:27 a.m. without answer. “Pls answer,” Mortensen texted Goncalves at 4:32 a.m.\n\nRecords indicate Funke accessed Snapchat at 4:34 a.m. and Instagram at 4:37 a.m. before all phone communications from the two roommates stopped for about three hours.\n\nProsecutors have indicated they plan to use the testimony of the two surviving roommates and want to use their text messages to illustrate the timeline of the night.\n\nBut defense attorney Anne Taylor has pointed out that while the roommates claim they were panicked and worried about the other roommates, they didn’t attempt to get help.\n\nRoommates were active on phones, social media before calling 911\n\nProsecution filings previously asserted Mortensen and Funke woke up around 10:23 a.m. to discover their messages from their roommates were unanswered. But the transcript shared by the defense shows phone activity more than two hours before they started reaching out to their unresponsive roommates and more than four hours before calling 911.\n\nSeveral hours after the panicked text exchange, records show Funke’s phone activity started again with a phone call to her dad at 7:30 a.m. Both she and Mortensen used their phones that morning, with Funke calling her parents and Mortensen accessing several social media apps. It is unclear from the records what exactly she was doing on the apps.\n\nDuring that time, Funke had a phone call with her dad and took photos, while Mortensen was on Instagram for over two hours, court documents show. She also spent time messaging on Snapchat and on Indeed.\n\nAt 10:23 a.m., Mortensen begins reaching out to her roommates again.\n\n“Pls answer,” she texts Goncalves. “R u up,” she asks Mogen.\n\n“R u up??” she texts Goncalves again.\n\nThe two roommates continued using their phones for the next hour, including messages and calls to people only named through initials, until Funke called 911 at 11:56 a.m. to report Kernodle unconscious at the residence, records show. Two other friends could be heard with them on the call.\n\nHeavy breathing and crying can be heard in audio of the 911 call as the surviving roommates pass the phone between them and what sounds like two other people, answering the dispatcher in fragmented responses.\n\n“Something has happened in our house, we don’t know what,” one of the roommates says.\n\nOn the call they reported 20-year-old Kernodle unconscious, telling the dispatcher she had come home drunk the night before. “She’s not waking up,” one of them says.\n\nPolice arrived to find Kernodle and Chapin dead on the floor of the second floor. Upstairs, Goncalves and Mogen were dead in one of the beds with visible stab wounds.\n\nA tan leather knife sheath was laying on the bed next to Mogen. Male DNA was later found on the button snap of the knife sheath and Kohberger was found to be a “statistical match” to the sample, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors plan to use testimony from surviving roommates\n\nAs Kohberger’s trial looms, expected to begin in August, filings show the defense team intends to zero in on the discrepancies in the timeline and why the roommates waited eight hours to call 911.\n\n“Neither of them left the house,” a filing from Taylor submitted this week said. “Neither of them called friends, family or law enforcement for help. Instead, both have a substantial amount of activity beginning in earnest less than 4 hours after DM made her way to BF’s room. BF and DM communicate with friends and parents and DM is on social media.”\n\nKohberger’s defense team appears to be “taking great pains” to keep out Mortensen’s testimony – especially because she identified the person in the house that night as having bushy eyebrows, attorney Misty Marris told CNN’s News Central.\n\n“Essentially the defense is trying to diminish some of the credibility of potential witness testimony of those roommates and also trying to question the timeline of when these murders could have taken place,” Marris said.\n\nBryan Kohberger, accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students, in court in Latah County. Ted S. Warren/AP/File\n\nBut the roommates’ delay in calling 911 is not entirely surprising as there are many factors that go into responding to a stressful situation like this, Cauffman, the UC Irvine professor, said.\n\nThe amygdala, a part of the brain which acts as its alarm system, triggers the fight, flight or freeze response, Cauffman said. The prefrontal cortex, which helps with decision-making, isn’t fully developed until around age 25, and can be overwhelmed by the amygdala in a decision-making process like this, she added, which is especially relevant in this case as they were all young college students.\n\n“If you’re in a dangerous situation, and your amygdala is flooding your emotional response system, that’s going to overwhelm your prefrontal cortex. So just from the brain response system, we know 18- to 25-year-olds would respond differently,” according to Cauffman.\n\nIn addition, a psychological phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance, which helps the brain rationalize a situation to the least threatening explanation, combined with the way women are socialized to downplay fear, could lead to delayed reaction to the situation, she said.\n\n“Women are typically just socialized to downplay fear,” Cauffman said. “They’re often seen as overly dramatic or reactive. And so, if they were discussing the situation together, they might have reinforced each other’s doubts instead of escalating to call 911.”\n\nBut she emphasized there is no way to know exactly what was happening to the two roommates at the time, and there are many reasons why they could’ve reacted that way to the situation.\n\n“It could be because of our amygdala response. It could be to socialization of women. It could be to our cognitive processing, from cognitive dissonance,” she said.\n\n“This can be explained in so many different ways, it’s hard to just even pick one.”\n\nCNN’s Jean Casarez, Lauren del Valle and Holly Yan contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in a late-night Friday memo, directed federal agencies to revoke security clearances for more than a dozen of his perceived political enemies, including former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information” Trump said in the memo. “I hereby direct every executive department and agency head to take all additional action as necessary and consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearances held by the aforementioned individuals and to immediately rescind their access to classified information.”\n\nThe memo applies to classified briefings and any access the individuals might have had to classified information based on previous tenure in Congress.\n\nThe move marks the latest instance of Trump pulling security clearances from political rivals, after the president in February said he was “immediately” revoking former President Joe Biden’s security clearance and stopping his daily intelligence briefing. He has also used similar rescissions to crackdown on top law firms.\n\nFriday’s memo formalized the revocation of Biden’s security clearance, along with several others who the Trump administration has previously said it removed clearances from, and went on to block the former president’s family’s access to classified information – assuming they had any.\n\nIn addition to his Democratic rivals in the 2016 and 2024 election, Trump also revoked clearances from the two Republicans on the House committee that investigated his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and former Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger.\n\nEarlier this month Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that in accordance with a directive from Trump, she had revoked the security clearances of a number of the people named in Friday’s memo, including top Biden officials, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and former National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, as well as two of the attorneys who brought legal cases against Trump: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nIn another late-night memo on Friday, Trump revisited past grudges against lawyers who have opposed him and vowed to punish lawyers and law firms by rescinding security clearances and canceling federal contracts they hold.\n\nHe directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review the conduct of lawyers and law firms the administration considers to have filed frivolous lawsuits against the Trump administration or attempted to block immigration initiatives, broadening the president’s crackdown on the US legal community in the United States.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nCNN’s Clay Voytek and Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

        "content": "This handout image obtained March 16 from El Salvador’s Presidency Press Office shows Salvadoran police officers escorting alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua recently deported by the US government to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) prison. El Salvador’s Presidency Press Office/Handout/Reuters\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg vowed Friday to “get to the bottom” of whether the Trump administration violated his orders temporarily blocking President Donald Trump’s use of a sweeping 18th-century wartime authority to deport some migrants.\n\nThe tense hearing centered on Trump’s controversial invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport people the government accuses of being part of a Venezuelan gang. The proceedings saw Boasberg question and at times openly criticize the administration over its conduct during the case so far.\n\nHere’s more of what the judge said during a heated hearing:\n\n• Tough questioning on past order: Boasberg grilled DOJ lawyers over the administration’s response — or potential lack thereof — to an oral order from the judge last week. In a hearing last Saturday, the judge had ordered the government to immediately turn around planes that were carrying migrants to El Salvador under Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. The administration did not turn the planes around, saying in later court filings that it did not consider Boasberg’s order binding until a written version landed on the docket later that evening.\n\nOn Friday, Boasberg expressed doubt about the grounds for that argument, saying, “I often tell my clerks … that the most valuable treasure they possess is their reputation and their credibility. And I just ask you to make sure your team maintains that lesson.”\n\n• “Frightening” implications: The judge also raised concerns about the policy implications of Trump’s use of the sweeping wartime authority, calling it an “unprecedented and expanded use” of the 1798 law. Boasberg said it was “awfully frightening” to think that, under the arguments pushed by Justice Department attorneys, a president could claim “that anybody is invading the United States,” necessitating another use of the wartime authority.\n\n• Admonishment over language: Boasberg kicked off the hearing by criticizing the language and tone used by the Trump administration in some of its arguments and filings. The judge told DOJ attorney Drew Ensign that the government had used “intemperate and disrespectful” language that he’s “never seen from the United States.”",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nHollywood funnyman (and success story) Seth Rogen is known for many things, not the least of which is his penchant for smoking marijuana.\n\nIn a new interview with The Guardian published on Saturday, Rogen – who runs a weed business in addition to his writing, producing, directing and acting pursuits – acknowledged his ability to intake marijuana with ease may make him something of an outlier.\n\nWhile Rogen admitted “some strains” do put him “to sleep,” he said the type of marijuana he uses daily does not negatively affect his productivity.\n\n“For sure I process it differently than other people do,” the “Pineapple Express” star added. “I’ve been at parties with people and we’ll share a joint, and I’ll be fine and go about my day, and they’ll enter, like, a new dark period for three months. Years will go by and then I’ll run into them at a party and they’ll be, like, ‘The last time I saw you was the last time I smoked weed, and it was terrible.’”\n\n“I’m not physically gifted in many ways, but there’s one way in which I am, which is in my ability to process weed,” Rogen continued. “And to me it’s a very therapeutic part of my day to day journey which I don’t even question or think about any more, honestly.”\n\nWhen presented with the suggestion that he should leave his body to science, he replied, “Oh, I will.”\n\nThe Studio — Official Trailer | Apple TV+\n\nAs for his work, next week will see the premiere of Rogen’s new Apple TV+ series “The Studio,” which he co-created, wrote, directed and stars in. The buzzy show follows Rogen as the newly appointed head of a fictional Hollywood movie studio, with each episode welcoming industry heavyweights playing themselves.\n\nWhile it tackles a glitzy world full of lore and famous faces, Rogen and his producing partner Evan Goldberg looked to landmark workplace comedies of the past for inspiration and guidance.\n\n“We talked a lot about ‘The Office,’ which I love,” Rogen told the publication. “And how the boss is the most tragic figure on the show. Just because you’re at the top of the power structure, it doesn’t mean you’re less relatable or funny.”\n\nThey also wanted to make sure their new workplace comedy felt recognizable, both inside the entertainment industry and out.\n\n“We took great care to make sure the comedic premise itself was relatable to anyone watching,” he said.\n\nRegarding one episode, in which Rogen’s character has a meltdown at the Golden Globes because he suspects Zoë Kravitz – the star of a movie he greenlit – won’t thank him if she wins, Rogen said, “I think people with regular office jobs have that feeling of, ‘Oh! There’s a presentation I helped on and the person giving it isn’t going to acknowledge I helped on it!’”\n\n“The Studio” premieres March 26 on Apple TV+.",

        "title": "Last year Barcelona finally turned on its crowds of tourists. Now it’s worried about what happens next",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nIt was the water pistol shot that echoed around the world.\n\nIn the summer of 2024, after years of enduring the pressures of overtourism, locals in Barcelona ramped up their protest, with thousands gathering to chant “tourists go home.” But it was a small group armed with toy water pistols who made headlines by squirting them at visitors seated in outdoor cafes.\n\nA mischievous, seemingly harmless act, perhaps. Yet as pictures of the incident spread globally, the firepower of those toy weapons soon became apparent. Barcelona’s longstanding tensions over the city’s transformation into a tourist playground had erupted into very public hostility.\n\nThe surprise squirt attack, criticized by some top tourism officials, was also emblematic of a situation ongoing in many other destinations, from Amsterdam to Bali, where local residents face being priced out of their own homes by a global tourism industry that gets bigger and more expansive every year.\n\nBarcelona, like many of these places, also faces another problem. While mass tourism might be putting a strain on the city, it’s also vital to its existence, providing jobs and income. Tourism is now 14% of the city’s economy and provides 150,000 jobs, said Mateu Hernández, director of the Barcelona Tourism Consortium.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Barcelona protesters squirt water at tourists 00:49 - Source: CNN See Barcelona protesters squirt water at tourists 00:49\n\nIt’s a balancing act the city’s tourism officials are only too aware of as Barcelona prepares for the arrival of throngs of visitors this summer. Even as measures are enacted aimed at helping protect local residents, there have been official concerns that many tourists may not feel welcome.\n\nHernández, whose Consortium is the city’s tourism promotion board, pointed to “a perception that Barcelona doesn’t want tourists. We are worried about Barcelona’s image of overtourism,” he told a group of foreign correspondents in Madrid in January.\n\nNow, authorities are working to change perceptions before this summer arrives. Visitors will certainly still come — a newly opened cruise terminal has the potential to bring in many thousands more tourists — but will some stay away?\n\nBefore the crowds\n\nThousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona last July to protest about tourist overcrowding. Paco Freire/SOPA Images/Shutterstock\n\nTourism wasn’t always a problem in Barcelona. For years the capital of Spain’s northeastern Catalonia region welcomed a steady but sustainable flow of visitors there to savor the beautiful architecture and Mediterranean lifestyle.\n\nThen came the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics. In its runup, an urban renewal upgraded the airport, removed railroad tracks and industry located along the Mediterranean and installed beaches. The Games then provided a spotlight for the style and culture of the historic city that had opened to the sea.\n\nBy 2004, Barcelona, a city of 1.5 million residents, received 4.5 million tourists who stayed overnight. The airport soon added a third runway and a new terminal. Ryanair began low-cost flights there in 2010. More cruise ship terminals were built, and by 2019, just before the Covid pandemic, there were 16.1 million overnight tourists, official figures show.\n\nAnd then the latest backlash. It’s unclear whether last year’s protests had a direct impact, but 15.5 million tourists stayed overnight in Barcelona in 2024 — 100,000 less than in 2023, official figures show. The city’s population had increased to 1.7 million.\n\nThe 1992 Summer Olympics marked a turning point for Barcelona. George Tiedemann/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images\n\nSome tourists spend only the day in the city. Among them, 1.6 million cruise ship passengers “in transit” in 2024, the Port of Barcelona reported. The majority come ashore when their ships dock in the morning, tour the city, and return by late afternoon to sail for the next destination, the tourism consortium press office said.\n\nThe resulting crowds, at places like La Rambla street and in the adjacent Gothic quarter, the oldest part of town, are partly to blame for the ire among Barcelona’s residents.\n\n“We feel quite invaded,” Joan Albert Riu Fortuny, a lifelong Barcelona resident, told CNN.\n\n‘There’s a limit’\n\nBarcelona's Park Guëll, designed by Antoni Gaudí, is among attractions that have become overwhelmed by tourists. Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne focal point of crowding, said Jordi Valls, a Barcelona deputy mayor whose portfolio includes tourism, is the neighborhood around the iconic Sagrada Familia Basilica. It’s home to 50,000 residents, he said, but in summer, another 50,000 tourists can show up daily there, just to look at the still-unfinished church.\n\n“We think tourist demand is unstoppable,” Valls told CNN. “Everyone is welcome. But there’s a limit,” he said, without specifying the number. “The only possibility is to control the supply.”\n\nA plan to double the tourist tax — up to more than $16 (15 euros) per tourist per night in Barcelona — was unveiled in February by the Catalan regional government. If approved, it would earmark at least 25% of the revenue to help ease a housing shortage, which is a prime complaint among residents.\n\nShort-term tourist rental apartments are widely blamed as a factor in reducing affordable housing in Barcelona. The average price of long-term rental apartments, where residents live, increased 68% in the past decade, the city’s housing office told CNN.\n\n“With tourist apartments, the owner gets much more money by renting it that way than in a long-term lease,” said Riu Fortuny, the Barcelona resident. “There’s not enough available housing.”\n\nIn all, Barcelona has 152,000 beds available nightly for visitors, the tourism consortium’s Hernández added, mainly in hotels but also including 60,000 in tourist apartments.\n\nWith such a potent industry, the proposed doubling of the tourist tax “does nothing more than legitimize the very touristic activity,” Daniel Pardo, a longtime member of the Assembly of Neighborhoods for Tourism Degrowth, in Barcelona, told CNN. “It’s an isolated measure that doesn’t change the status quo.”\n\nThe Assembly helped organize the large tourism protest last July — but not the water pistol part of it, Pardo said. He added that there will “surely” be more protests this year, but that specific plans would be decided later.\n\n‘Giant tourist trap’\n\nThe Sagrada Familia Bascilica, another Gaudí design, is now only accepting pre-booked visitors. Moritz Wolf/imageBROKER/Shutterstock\n\nAt the city’s most-visited sites, there are signs of change in how Barcelona is receiving the tourists.\n\nOn La Rambla, sensors were installed last year to measure foot traffic, through cell phone movements, along the 0.8 mile (1.3 kilometer) promenade, said Xavi Masip, manager of Friends of La Rambla, a 65-year-old neighborhood association to protect and promote the street.\n\n“The sensors give an indication of how and where people are moving, at what hours, and the areas with some saturation,” Masip told CNN. “La Rambla is very full. There are times when those of us from Barcelona can feel bothered” about it.\n\nSome congested areas have already been identified, like a narrow section near the Plaza de Catalunya, at one end of La Rambla, Masip said. The port, at the other end of the street, has also installed some sensors.\n\n“A big part of this is that crowds aren’t managed well” on La Rambla, said Will Gluckin, global communications manager for Get Your Guide, a Berlin-based platform offering travel experiences in destinations around the world. The firm is a sponsor for the Friends of La Rambla initiative that installed the sensors.\n\n“We send customers to La Rambla every day,” said Gluckin, whose company has operated in Barcelona for a decade. He told CNN that “poor-quality tourist shops” and many fast-food eateries there have made “La Rambla something of a giant tourist trap instead of a genuinely good place to visit.”\n\nThe city's La Rambla pedestrian thoroughfare is frequently overwhelmed by tourist crowds. Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/Shutterstock\n\nBut it’s free, and tourists keep walking it, even as street work continues this year to widen the central pedestrian portion of La Rambla and to reduce the two lanes of vehicle traffic to just one on each side of it, Masip said.\n\nThe two most-visited sites that charge entry fees in Barcelona were both designed by modernist architect Antoni Gaudí. Each now sells only advance online tickets. The Sagrada Familia started this in 2020 during the Covid pandemic, and last year had 4.8 million visitors, 87% of them from outside of Spain, its press office said.\n\nPark Guëll, perched on a hill overlooking the city and the sea, shifted to advance online tickets only last year and had nearly 4.5 million visitors. This year the park, with its distinctive Gaudi curvy mosaics, increased the standard entry fee to $19.50 (18 euros), from $10.80 (10 euros). It’s a move aimed at managing the crowds, said deputy mayor Valls.\n\nTo make room for more visitors on the street, the city says it has removed benches and small gardens around Sagrada Familia, where a new tower, the tallest of all the church’s spires, is to be completed later this year. At Park Guëll, tour bus and taxi stops have been relocated farther from the entrance, to lessen crowd density there.\n\nOver at the port, Barcelona’s seventh cruise ship terminal just opened in February. It’s a sleek structure exclusively for ships from MSC Cruises, a Geneva-based global cruise operator. MSC said it has stopped using three other cruise terminals at the port for its ships.\n\nAbout 800 cruise ships a year use Barcelona's cruise port. Angel Garcia/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut the city aims to reduce the seven terminals to just five, through negotiations, deputy mayor Valls told CNN. Three existing terminals, he said, have concessions due to expire in 2029.\n\nMSC’s Madrid press office told CNN its new terminal has a 30-year concession.\n\n“MSC Cruises is committed to responsible tourism,” a company statement said, adding that it gives prior notice to local authorities about ship arrival and departure times, and details about passengers who’ll visit various tourist sites. “This guarantees that our clients enjoy their vacations while helping Barcelona’s economy and local jobs.”\n\nIn all, about 800 cruise ships arrive annually at the port and it’s not the only flash point of big tourism infrastructure in Barcelona. Mayor Jaume Collboni announced last year that the city would revoke permits in 2028 for the 10,000 licensed tourist apartments, to help provide more affordable housing.\n\nBut Barcelona’s tourist apartments association, Apartur, opposes this, demanding hefty compensation for the owners and arguing that it would result in more unlicensed tourist apartments.\n\n‘There will be more tourists’\n\nBarcelona's airport handled a record 55 million passengers in 2024. Jorge Silva/Reuters\n\nAnd there’s talk of expanding Barcelona’s airport, which had a record 55 million passengers in 2024. It’s “at a saturation level,” said Hernández, of the tourism consortium. The airport has direct connections to about 200 destinations globally, 70 percent of them in Europe, also including eight destinations in the United States.\n\nThe Spanish government and Catalan officials are discussing “how to increase the capacity and protect the surroundings,” the Catalan president’s press office told CNN, adding that the airport sits in a river delta with European Union-protected marshlands and bird habitats.\n\nBarcelona’s appeal for tourists has even become a subject of study at college, said two American university students on a semester-abroad program in Madrid. They visited Barcelona for the first time in February on a school-organized trip and told CNN that the preparation materials mentioned tourism’s impact on Barcelona.\n\nSean Thompson, 20, a sociology major from Utica, New York, said, “I really did enjoy the city. It teaches us the effect of tourism on Barcelona and the hyper-tourism.”\n\nAndrew Durkin, 21, a finance major from Scranton, Pennsylvania, said, “I knew, going in, that there were attitudes toward tourists. I expected to be treated differently.”\n\nTheir visit included the Sagrada Familia and La Rambla. They expected bigger crowds but said it was a mostly rainy weekend in February, in low season.\n\nBut the crowds could be back for the summer.\n\n“We’re making an effort to manage, but high season is high season,” deputy mayor Valls said. “So, there will be more tourists.”",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nThree teenagers were killed and 15 other people were injured in a mass shooting at Young Park in Las Cruces, New Mexico, Friday night during an “unsanctioned car show,” according to local police.\n\nThe incident marks the 53rd mass shooting of 2025, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nThe shooting unfolded around 10 p.m. local time, and started with an altercation between two groups that then escalated to gunfire, Las Cruces Police Chief Jeremy Story said at a Saturday news conference.\n\nTwo 19-year-olds and one 16-year-old were killed, according to a Facebook post from Las Cruces Police. The victims haven’t been named.\n\nThe people injured range in age from 16 to 36 years old, according to police.\n\nNo one has been arrested yet in connection with the shooting, but police are “actively following multiple leads,” reads the post.\n\nYoung Park has been “troubled with crime” in recent years, Story said. The police department has taken steps to reduce crime, like locking the park at 11 p.m., but “we are still struggling with that,” he said.\n\nHe added that police have collected handgun-caliber casings from the scene. Story updated the number of people injured to 15, from an original count of 14 in the Facebook post.\n\nSeven of the people injured have been sent from local hospitals to El Paso for further treatment, Las Cruces Fire Chief Michael Daniels said at the news conference. Four patients have been treated and released. The status of the other four patients is unknown, he said.\n\n“This is a sad day for our community,” Las Cruces Mayor Eric Enriquez said at the news conference.\n\n“I want to ask the community to gather together, to stand strong and united as we try to heal and face this tragic event that took place in our city,” he said.\n\nNew Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said she was “heartbroken and horrified” by the shooting.\n\nThe governor added she was “mobilizing state resources to support local law enforcement in their investigation” and that violent crime in Las Cruces has increased by 46 percent compared to last year.\n\nIn a Saturday Instagram post, Las Cruces City Councilor and Mayor Pro Tem Johana Bencomo described the shooting as “a heinous act of violence that will leave our city mourning.”\n\n“My heart is broken for the victims and families impacted,” she wrote.\n\nLas Cruces is located on the edge of the Chihuahuan Desert, around 41 miles north of the US-Mexico border.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nIceland’s minister for children and education has resigned after admitting she had a child with a teenager more than three and a half decades ago, according to Icelandic media.\n\nÁsthildur Lóa Thórsdóttir revealed that she had started a relationship with a 15-year-old boy when she was 22 and had a son with him, Iceland’s public broadcaster RUV reported on Thursday.\n\nThórsdóttir met the boy while working as a counselor for a religious group, the Icelandic broadcaster said, before giving birth to his child when she was 23 and he was 16.\n\nThe age of consent is 15, according to the country’s penal code. However, it is illegal for adults to have sexual relations with a child under 18 if they are entrusted to teach them, with perpetrators facing up to 12 years in prison.\n\nThe father told RUV he had never seen himself as a victim in this situation, but noted that he was in a difficult place in his life and at home turned to the church group for support.\n\nIceland’s public broadcaster reported that the relationship was kept secret but that the father was present for the birth of his child and initially allowed contact, but nearly all access was cut off before his son turned 1.\n\nHe was however required to pay child support for 18 years.\n\nThe young father sought assistance from the Ministry of Justice and the church’s family service to see his child, but Thórsdóttir refused him visitation rights, according to Iceland’s public broadcaster.\n\nShortly after RUV’s report on Thursday, Thórsdóttir resigned from her ministerial position, the public broadcaster said. She will continue to represent the People’s Party as a member of parliament.\n\nIceland’s prime minister said Thórsdóttir had met with the country’s three party leaders but it had been her decision to resign, according to RUV.\n\n“We discussed the options together and heard her account of the matter in detail for the first time at that meeting,” Prime Minister Kristrún Frostadóttir said at a news conference Friday, RUV reported. The leader reiterated that Thórsdóttir had swiftly taken responsibility by resigning.\n\n“Of course, this is an unfortunate matter, but it has nothing to do with our work,” Frostadóttir said, adding that the prime minister’s office had not finished investigating the matter since it was brought to their attention a week ago.\n\nCNN has reached out to Thórsdóttir and Iceland’s Ministry for Education and Children for comment.",

        "content": "Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen cutting a bob, most people worry about how to style their new cropped mop. Textured or straight? Side or middle part? Adorned with barrette clips or tucked demurely behind the ears? But often overlooked are the clothes that accompany the coiffure. It’s a consideration that has not escaped American actor Leslie Bibb, however, who this week has been strutting the streets of New York in a series of elegantly tailored suits, blazers and trench coats.\n\nThe breakout star of HBO’s The White Lotus, which is set at a luxury hotel in Thailand, Bibb plays one third of the toxic girl-gang trio in season three. In recent weeks she has become known for her blunt, ultra-short bob as much as her acting chops. (HBO Max and CNN are both owned by parent company Warner Bros. Discovery).\n\nOn Tuesday, Bibb’s hairdresser Chris McMillan posted a video of her latest appointment on TikTok — which has over 170,000 likes and counting. McMillan branded Bibb’s ‘do as “the c*nty little bob,” adding that the style helped filming continuity, because it was easy to maintain. “Some people have ‘The Rachel,’” Bibb said on camera, referring to the shiny layers popularized by Jennifer Aniston in the ‘90s on the TV show “Friends” where she played the character, Rachel Green. “I have the ‘c*nty little bob’,” he concluded.\n\nBibb's bob is her North Star when building an outfit. Her shoulders, exaggerated here in a Stella McCartney skirt suit, balance the look.

TheStewartofNY/GC Images/Getty Images\n\nSome might find that a scene-stealing haircut competes with their outfits, but Bibb understands that a good ensemble is built holistically — and the goal, above all else, is harmony. Her bob is her North Star, setting the tone for everything below the neck.\n\nBibb’s recent looks, styled by Jeanann Williams, have remained neutral in color and sharp in silhouette. She’s steered away from clashing, loud prints and vibrant hues, as well as anything overly feminine. Instead, her looks, including navy pin-striped suits (cropped at the waist) and a black ‘80s-style overcoat from Toteme, mirrored the edgy androgyny of her cut.\n\nBibb’s shoulders, unencumbered by the weight of her hair, are one of her main visual focal points — and she wears them like a prized accessory. On Wednesday, Bibb stepped out in a boxy grey blazer from Stella McCartney, complete with power suit shoulder padding. But for a Jimmy Falon appearance on Monday, her shoulders were kept bare and she looked striking in a Jacquemus scoop-back dress. dress.\n\nBibb mixes sharp tailoring with a Toteme overcoat. MediaPunch/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images/Getty Images\n\nBibb’s approach to bob-friendly dressing is all the more relevant given that the cut is fast-becoming one of the defining styles of 2025. According to recent Pinterest data, searches for “bob” are up 89% from the previous year, while “short hair inspo” jumped by 57% during the same period. It was also the cut du jour at the Golden Globes red carpet, adopted fearlessly by Zendaya, Selena Gomez, Cate Blanchett, Emma D’Arcy and Keira Knightly.\n\nOf course, drastic cuts are always subject to regret, but following the fashion formula set out by “The White Lotus” star might at least trim down the margin of error.",

        "title": "‘How are you going to do that?’ Pentagon scrambles to make Trump’s ‘Golden Dome’ missile defense system a reality",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nUS military officials are scrambling to develop a “Golden Dome” defense system that can protect the country from long-range missile strikes and have been told by the White House that no expense will be spared in order to fulfill one of President Donald Trump’s top Pentagon priorities, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\n“Golden Dome” is the Trump administration’s attempt to rebrand vague plans for developing a missile defense system akin to Israel’s Iron Dome.\n\nAt a time the Pentagon is looking to cut budgets, the Trump administration has ordered military officials to ensure future funding for “Golden Dome” is reflected in new budget estimates for 2026 to 2030 – but the system itself remains undefined beyond a name, the sources said.\n\n“Right now, Golden Dome is, it’s really an idea,” one source familiar with internal discussions about the project said, adding there may be technology in the pipeline that, if ever scaled up, could apply to it, but as of now discussions are purely conceptual.\n\nThat makes projecting future costs nearly impossible, the source added, though it would likely cost billions of dollars to construct and maintain.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted the US needs a missile defense program similar to Israel’s Iron Dome, but the systems are orders of magnitude apart. In practical terms, the comparison is less apples to oranges, and more apples to aircraft carriers.\n\nIsrael’s Iron Dome missile defense system selectively protects populated areas from short-range threats in a country the size of New Jersey; Trump wants a space-based missile defense system capable of defending the entire United States from advanced ballistic and hypersonic missiles.\n\nAn Israeli soldier takes up a position in front of a battery of an Iron Dome air defense system near Jerusalem on April 15, 2024. Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor one thing, “Israel is tiny,” the source familiar with ongoing internal discussions about the Golden Dome project said. “So, it is 100% feasible to blanket Israel in things like radars and a combination of mobile and fixed interceptors.”\n\n“How are you going to do that in the United States? You can’t do it just at the borders and the shoreline, because intercontinental ballistic missiles, they can re-enter the atmosphere over Kansas.”\n\nStill, Trump issued an executive order during his first week in office ordering Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to submit a plan for developing and implementing the next-generation missile defense shield by March 28.\n\nAnd a senior Pentagon official insisted earlier this week that work is underway.\n\n“Consistent with protecting the homeland and per President Trump’s [executive order], we’re working with the industrial base and [through] supply chain challenges associated with standing up the Golden Dome,” Steven J. Morani, currently performing the duties of undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment said this week at the McAleese Defense Programs Conference in Washington.\n\nAt the same time, Pentagon officials have been realigning the Defense Department’s 2026 budget proposal to meet Hegseth’s priorities, which were outlined in a memo delivered to senior leaders last week and represents a major overhaul of the military’s strategic goals, according to a copy obtained by CNN.\n\nThe memo specifically directs Pentagon leadership to focus on strengthening missile defense of the US homeland through Trump’s “Golden Dome.”\n\n“There is a rigorous analytic process underway taking a relook at [the budget],” Morani added. “This is standard practice for any new administration that takes office.”\n\nBut it remains unclear how much money the Pentagon will request for Trump’s Golden Dome in its budget proposal or how officials will determine the amount of funding is required.\n\nRetired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery believes creating a ballistic missile defense system may be possible in 7-10 years, but even then, it will have severe limitations, potentially capable of protecting only critical federal buildings and major cities.\n\n“The more you want it closer to 100%, the more expensive it’s going to get,” said Montgomery, the senior director of the Center On Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nA comprehensive system will require different sets of satellites for communication, sensing incoming missiles, and launching interceptors, Montgomery told CNN. Those types of systems are long-term projects, he said, requiring existing defenses to fill the gap in the meantime.\n\n“You’ve gotta be responsible here,” Montgomery said. “You’re not going to be able to defend everything with these ground-based missiles. They defend a circle around them, but it’s not large.”\n\nPotential pay day for arms companies\n\nUS arms manufacturers are already seeing dollar signs. The Missile Defense Agency held an Industry Day in mid-February to solicit bids from companies interested in helping to plan and build Golden Dome.\n\nThe agency received more than 360 secret and unclassified abstracts about ideas for how to plan and execute the system.\n\nLockheed Martin has taken it a step further, creating a polished website for Golden Dome claiming the world’s largest defense contractor has the “proven, mission-tested capabilities and track record of integration to bring this effort to life.”\n\nIn the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative to create a space-based defense against ballistic nuclear missiles. The system was derisively nicknamed “Star Wars,” and consumed tens of billions of dollars before it was ultimately cancelled, facing insurmountable technical and economic hurdles.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan addresses the nation on the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1983. Corbis/Getty Images\n\nLaura Grego, a Senior Research Director of the Global Security Program at the Union for Concerned Scientists, says the same challenges remain and have been known for years.\n\n“It has been long understood that defending against a sophisticated nuclear arsenal is technically and economically unfeasible,” Grego told CNN.\n\nAmerica’s current ballistic missile defense is designed to thwart a small number of missiles from a rogue state such as North Korea or Iran. The system relies on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), which has failed nearly half of its tests, according to the Arms Control Association, rendering it incapable of stopping a major attack from Russia or China.\n\nBut in his executive order, Trump called for a far more complex and robust system - space-based interceptors capable of downing a target moments after it launches.\n\nSuch a system would require thousands of interceptors in low-earth orbit to intercept even a single North Korean missile launch, according to the American Physical Society (APS), which has studied the feasibility of ballistic missile defenses for years. A single interceptor in orbit is almost never at the right place and time to rapidly intercept a ballistic missile launch, so you need exponentially more to ensure adequate coverage.\n\n“We estimate that a constellation of about 16,000 interceptors would be needed to attempt to counter a rapid salvo of ten solid-propellant ICBMs like the [North Korean] Hwasong-18,” the APS wrote in a study earlier this month.\n\nEven then, Grego says a space-based missile defense system is vulnerable to enemy anti-satellite attacks from far less expensive ground-based systems.\n\n“The most critical weakness of a system like this is its brittleness, its vulnerability to attack,” Grego added.\n\nIn the Red Sea, the US has fired scores of multi-million dollar interceptor missiles at Houthi drones and missiles that cost a fraction of the price. The fiscal imbalance gets far worse when the system is in space, according to John Tierney, a former Democratic congressman who held years of hearings on ballistic missile defense.\n\n“It’s a joke. It’s basically a scam,” Tierney said bluntly. Now the executive director for the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation, Tierney ripped Trump for being “willing to throw billions and billions and billions of dollars at something that won’t work.”\n\nAdversaries likely to react\n\nAs the US pours money into research and developing the Golden Dome, current and former officials say America’s adversaries will likely expand their own arsenal of ballistic missiles in an effort to stay ahead.\n\nBut since the offensive ballistic missiles are far less expensive than the interceptors needed to stop them, Tierney says the system quickly becomes financially unfeasible.\n\nUS military officials are also assessing how Golden Dome could disrupt the current stability provided by nuclear deterrence, according to the source familiar with internal planning discussions related to the project.\n\nToday, the main US deterrent against another country launching a preemptive nuclear attack is its survivable second strike, or ability to retaliate even after enduring an initial nuclear attack, the source said.\n\n“If you implement something that your nuclear armed adversaries believe is a reliable countermeasure that just nullifies their nuclear arsenal, now you’ve done away with deterrent stability, because you’ve improved the ease of the United States sending a nuclear attack to them with impunity,” the source added. “And then you have to ask yourself, well, how much do we trust the US not to do that?”\n\n“If I’m China, if I’m Russia, my confidence is lower and lower, that that the US won’t strike us with a nuclear missile in in a crisis,” according to the same source.\n\n“Strategically, it doesn’t make any sense. Technically, it doesn’t make any sense. Economically it doesn’t make any sense,” Tierney added.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed a quote about the comprehensive system necessary to provide the kind of protection President Donald Trump has asked for. Retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery said, “You’ve gotta be responsible here. You’re not going to be able to defend everything with these ground-based missiles. They defend a circle around them, but it’s not large.”",

        "title": "FBI’s weekend homework: Redact the Epstein files",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nFBI agents are working around the clock – some in 12-hour overnight shifts – on a frenzied mission this week.\n\nThe urgent work isn’t an impending national security threat, but instead reviewing documents and other evidence in the investigation of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein to make redactions before the Justice Department releases them publicly, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nThe frantic effort is trying to solve a problem largely of the White House’s own making: Trump allies spent months fanning conspiracies over Epstein’s suicide death and whether the government was holding on to information that could expose prominent people who may have been in involved in his alleged crimes.\n\nLast month, Attorney General Pam Bondi touted the release of Epstein files, which was met with derision from Trump’s MAGA supporters who expected to learn new information and were underwhelmed by what they saw.\n\nAgents have been ordered to set aside investigations, including some related to threats from China and Iran, to help complete the redactions, people briefed on the matter say.\n\nEvery division in the bureau has been ordered to provide agents to the cause, including those who work on criminal and national security matters. This weekend, agents in the Washington field office are spending hours on redaction duty, people briefed on the matter say.\n\n“Under Attorney General Bondi’s leadership, the Department of Justice is working relentlessly to deliver unprecedented transparency for the American people,” a Justice Department spokesperson said in response to CNN’s inquiry. An FBI spokesman added, “All appropriate administrative and legal requirements are being adhered to.”\n\nFor much of the week, agents could be seen filing into a room at FBI headquarters, with some also doing the work at field offices in New York and at an FBI office in Chantilly, Virginia, the sources said. For hours, agents sit at banks of computers, using editing software to identify redactions required under federal laws, including the Privacy Act. The material also includes video.\n\nBondi ordered the current round of redactions after promising to release all evidence related to the Epstein investigation. The first tranche, released in February, consisted largely of documents already in the public domain.\n\nThe Justice Department called the release “symbolic,” and Bondi said in a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel that she belatedly learned that investigators in New York, which led the Epstein case, had held on to thousands of pages of documents. She demanded the documents and video be produced to her office promptly.\n\n“There will be no withholdings or limitations to my or your access. The Department of Justice will ensure any public disclosure of these files will be done in a manner to protect the privacy of victims and in accordance with law, as I have done my entire career as prosecutor,” Bondi wrote to Patel.\n\nThe problem remains, however, that Justice and FBI officials don’t believe the new documents set to be released in the coming days will contain any bombshells. Officials expect that even after the release of the latest documents, people who believe there are secrets being covered up will likely continue to believe there is a cover-up, much like how cottage industry of conspiracies have continued to flourish over President John F. Kennedy’s assassination.\n\nEven weeks after the release of the first tranche of documents, social media posts about other Justice Department enforcement matters are bombarded with replies from apparent pro-Trump accounts demanding more substantive releases of the so-called Epstein files.\n\nA Justice official says that even if the latest tranche of documents don’t satisfy questions from critics, the department is satisfied that the public will end up having access to more documents and evidence than they would have if Bondi hadn’t ordered the review.\n\n“The goal is transparency,” the official said.\n\nThe Epstein documents review is part of a wider release of records promised by President Donald Trump, including documents related to the assassinations of Martin Luther King and President Kennedy.\n\nThousands of pages of JFK assassination documents released earlier this week were the subject of another controversy because some people’s Social Security numbers and other private information were left unredacted.\n\nExperts said that the JFK records didn’t contain new information to support conspiracies about who killed the president. Tom Samoluk, who was a deputy director of the Assassination Records Review Board, told CNN that from what he reviewed, there isn’t anything to change the current conclusion of Kennedy’s assassination: that a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, was responsible for his death.\n\nThe pending release of Epstein documents raised concerns that victims could be re-victimized if their personal information is released.\n\nKristina Rose, former director of the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime, urged the FBI and Justice Department to ensure the redactions are done to protect victims’ information.\n\n“Revealing personally identifiable information from the Epstein files without the victims’ permission or consultation is a shocking betrayal of trust and an appalling violation of the Justice Department’s own policies,” Rose said. “The Justice Department has a solemn responsibility to protect the private information of crime victims and witnesses. Failing to do so can cause unnecessary trauma and anguish, and compromise victim safety — even the tiniest amount of personal information can be easily traced back to them.”",

The Sports Bra bar is attracting major attention as March Madness kicks off. A New Jersey woman returned a library book that’s nearly a century overdue. Plus, local police and a four-year-old struck a plea deal in Wisconsin after his mom ate his ice cream.\n\nDownload Transcript Episode Transcript\n\nKrista Bo 00:00:00 Hey there. I know the world can feel a little cruel sometimes, but kindness is actually more common than you might think. Don't believe me? Well, I have the data to back it up. This year's World Happiness Report from the U.N. says 7 in 10 people worldwide did at least one nice thing for a stranger in the last month. Hundreds of high schoolers in Pennsylvania are learning just how far a small gesture can go.\n\nKristina Ulmer 00:00:26 I think it's important to know that not only are people out there doing kind things, but that kids are doing fine things, and that these kids are going to grow up and be the adults that are running our world.\n\nKrista Bo 00:00:36 Plus, how justice and dessert was served to a four year old with a sweet tooth. From CNN I'm Krista Bo and this is Five Good Things.\n\nKrista Bo 00:00:50 Having a heart of gold is ideal. But an Australian man is living proof that having a titanium heart could be a real lifesaver.\n\nProf. Chris Hayward 00:00:59 This isn't the first time that someone with a total artificial heart of this sort has gone home in the world, and so really, it is world leading.\n\nKrista Bo 00:01:08 St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney says an Aussie in his 40s, is now the first person to live 100 days with an artificial titanium heart. Facing severe heart failure, the man got the surgery back in November and left the hospital in February. Doctors say he was living at home until a donor heart became available earlier this month. Professor Chris Hayward is one of his cardiac specialists.\n\nProf. Chris Hayward 00:01:30 This kind of technology is a real game changer. Our patient is up and about. He's walking around. He is doing things that he has been able to do for many years.\n\nKrista Bo 00:01:39 'The U.S. has also had some success with the new technology. Five patients in an FDA trial received titanium hearts, including a 58-year-old man in Texas who was sustained for eight days last July until he received a transplant.\n\nKrista Bo 00:01:53 The World Health Organization reports cardiovascular diseases claim 18 million lives globally each year. And in the U.S., federal data shows only a fraction, about 3500 people received donor hearts last year. Professor Hayward predicts that within a decade, these artificial hearts could become a vital alternative for those waiting for a lifeline.\n\nKrista Bo 00:02:17 'If someone gave you $20 to make someone else's day, what would you do with it? Well, students at Hatboro-Horsham High School in Pennsylvania certainly understood the assignment.\n\n'Hatboro-Horsham High School Students 00:02:29 So for the $20 challenge, we decided to combine all of our money.\n\n'Hatboro-Horsham High School Students 00:02:33 And we're here to target getting toys for little kids in the hospital.\n\n'Hatboro-Horsham High School Students 00:02:37 Yup. Let's go.\n\n'Hatboro-Horsham High School Students 00:02:38 Our $20 challenge. We made goodie bags for hygiene items for the homeless. We made truffles and distribute them to all the teachers, and we planned to do it until we graduate.\n\nKrista Bo 00:02:47 That's just a taste of how hundreds of teams over the last seven years have turned $20 bills into ripples of kindness. Their English teacher, Kristina Ulmer, started the $20 Kindness Challenge in memory of her sister Katie, who tragically died in a car crash in 2014 after finishing her shift as a waitress. When Christina arrived at the scene, she asked the police officer if she could go home with her sister's purse because she didn't want to leave without something of Katie's to hold on to.\n\nKristina Ulmer 00:03:15 And she had a wallet and it was stuffed full of cash, you know, dollar bills and fives and tens. I just sat there with the money and I thought, what do I do with this money? I don't know what to do with this. But I knew I had to go to something good because my sister, from the time we were little, always wanted to help people in like, their worst moments.\n\nKrista Bo 00:03:35 Kristina stashed the purse and its contents in the back of a closet. Fast forward to 2018, she assigned her students Ray Bradbury's 1953 classic, \"Fahrenheit 451.\" The novel is set in a world where everyone is glued to their screens and lacked empathy.\n\nKristina Ulmer 00:03:50 And so we were talking a lot about dystopian novels are their warnings to us. And so what can we do to prevent our world from becoming that world to this very eerily similar.\n\nKrista Bo 00:04:01 That was her light bulb moment. Use her sister's money to create the $20 Kindness Challenge.\n\nKristina Ulmer 00:04:07 And my only requirement was that they record a little reflection. And then I compiled it in a big video just for me to share with them, so that we could all watch it and see what everybody did.\n\n'Hatboro-Horsham High School Students 00:04:15 We combined our $20 to make cookies for people at a retirement home.\n\n'Hatboro-Horsham High School Students 00:04:19 We helped to buy presents for one of the kids in our school district.\n\n'Hatboro-Horsham High School Students 00:04:22 We went to the animal shelter, bought them a bunch of toys and gifts for them.\n\nKrista Bo 00:04:27 And thanks to donations. She's been doing it twice a year ever since with her classes.\n\nKristina Ulmer 00:04:32 They start to realize I can do things that show that I'm thoughtful, and I'm thinking about someone without really spending a dollar.\n\nKrista Bo 00:04:39 She finds comfort in the fact that these acts of kindness keep her sister's memory alive while planting seeds for a better future.\n\nKristina Ulmer 00:04:46 These kids are going to grow up and be the adults that are running our world. And so the fact that they're doing it as teenagers, my hope is that they continue doing it into adulthood.\n\nKrista Bo 00:04:57 March Madness fans, your time has finally come. The NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament has officially kicked off, and for the next few weeks, dozens of teams will battle it out to get to the championship game in Tampa, Florida on April 6th. And if you're looking for a place to watch the games, Jenny Nguyen suggests finding a spot that champions women's sports. Like The Sports Bra.\n\nJenny Nguyen 00:05:21 So The Sports Bra is the world's first sports bar, 100% dedicated to women's sports. We support women. That's that's our tagline now. It's like a double entendre. It's funny, but it's also true.\n\nKrista Bo 00:05:33 Jenny is the founder and CEO of the Sports Bra, or just \"the bra,\" as it's affectionately called, located in downtown Portland, Oregon. It's got four screens, a bar top custom made from NCAA tournament hardwood floors and walls covered with sports jerseys and memorabilia.\n\nJenny Nguyen 00:05:50 We were seeing record numbers like hours and hours of waits. People like lining up around the block, and that's when it was just like, oh, you know, I feel like we've tapped into something really important and really special.\n\nKrista Bo 00:06:02 Opened in 2022, Jenny says her secret sauce was just being inclusive and community centered.\n\nJenny Nguyen 00:06:09 I opened a place for a lot of people, whether they were women's sports fans, sports fans in general, or not.\n\nKrista Bo 00:06:16 I'm sure you remember last year's Women's March Madness tournament was so popular it broke TV viewership records, which meant Jenny's Sports Bra had to keep a waitlist.\n\nJenny Nguyen 00:06:25 I feel like people were calling in sick to work to come watch their teams play in March Madness, like brackets were legit.\n\nKrista Bo 00:06:32 'This year, Jenny says she's expecting the same energy and attendance, especially during the evening games. When the big dance is over, jenny expects business to keep booming, along with the popularity of women's sports and the number of bars where you can watch them. And with some help from Alexis Ohanian, Serena Williams husband and Reddit co-founder, Jenny plans to franchise for The Sports Bra. She hopes to open three new locations by the end of the year.\n\nKrista Bo 00:07:01 'When Mary Cooper was sorting through her late mother's belongings, the 81-year-old stumbled upon an unexpected treasure - a library book that was way overdue.\n\nSherri Taliercio 00:07:12 Mary had said, you know, you're going to want to take a look at this. You know, it's 99 years late.\n\nMary Cooper 00:07:17 And I find the dates and I'm thinking this had to have been taken out by my grandfather.\n\nKrista Bo 00:07:23 Mary's grandfather's name was Charles Tilton, a boat builder and craftsman who checked out the book from the Ocean County Library in New Jersey back when Calvin Coolidge was president in 1926.\n\nKrista Bo 00:07:34 The book was called, \"Home Made Toys for Girls and Boys\" by A. Neely Hall. Published in 1911, it taught readers how to make toys from wood, metal, and household items. Mary says her grandfather used to build toys for her mom when she was a kid. The toy boat in the book looked just like the one her mom used to have.\n\nMary Cooper 00:07:53 I said, I have to return this book to the library.

        "content": "A top former Bush administration lawyer is warning the White House not to begin ignoring court orders amid its standoff over President Donald Trump's deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\n\"I worry that there might be some people in the administration who would actually like to defy a judicial order. Which I think would be a terrible mistake,\" John Yoo, Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley, told Fox News Digital in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nMore than a dozen injunctions have been levied to at least temporarily block Trump policies across the country, including his deportation flights, birthright citizenship reforms and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts. Republican allies of the president have accused \"activist judges\" of seeking to override the executive in an improper breach of the co-equal branches of government.\n\nYoo, who previously served as deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice (DOJ) during former President George W. Bush's first term, said such a fight between the executive and judicial branches could threaten the legal system as a whole.\n\n\"There's only been one time in our history a president has refused to carry out a judicial order. And that was Abraham Lincoln at the start of the Civil War,\" Yoo said. \"It's almost something that really should only happen when the existence of the country is at stake, because if presidents don't obey judicial orders, then they deprive the judiciary of their primary means for carrying out their decisions.\"\n\nVANCE KNOCKS GLOBALIZATION'S ‘CHEAP LABOR’ AND LAUDS 'AMERICA'S GREAT INDUSTRIAL COMEBACK' AT AI SUMMIT\n\n\"If the courts can't render reliable decisions, then our legal system doesn't function. If our legal system doesn't function, the country is in really bad shape,\" he added.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly said it has not disobeyed any lawful court orders.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an emergency order on March 15 to halt deportation flights of suspected gang members to El Salvador for a period of 14 days.\n\nThe Trump administration has pointed out that the judge's written order was issued after two planes carrying alleged gang members were already in the air, arguing it was too late to turn the planes around at that point. A third plane that took off after the first two was not carrying any Alien Enemies Act deportees, the administration said.\n\n\"As I said from the podium and will continue to say, all of the flights that were subject to the written order of the judge took off before the order was pushed in the courtroom. And the president is well within his… Article II power and his authority under the Alien Enemies Act to make these decisions,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.\n\n\"And we think it's egregious that a single district judge is trying to tell the President of the United States who he can and cannot deport from our soil, especially when it comes to designated foreign terrorists.\"\n\nDOJ lawyers argued that Boasberg's verbal order to turn the planes around, issued shortly before the written order, is non-enforceable.\n\nJosh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, said the case was \"complex,\" but warned judges should be careful not to overstep their authority on matters with coequal branches of government.\n\n\"The judge held a hearing where, apparently, the ACLU presented oral arguments. The judge then issued an oral order where a DOJ lawyer was on the line. But the government was not able to make any arguments. The judge also did not give the government the time to take a timely appeal,\" Blackman told Fox News Digital on Tuesday.\n\n\"As a result, a judge is now inquiring why the government did not turn a plane around in international waters. Things are not so simple. Judges are losing sight of the fact that they are a coequal, and not superior, branch of government.\"\n\nTHESE ARE THE JUDGES GOING TOE TO TOE AGAINST TRUMP'S AGENDA\n\nYoo also noted the case was complex and said both parties were in uncharted territory, but pointed out that verbal orders have been valid in albeit very different circumstances.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"That's playing a little cute, is what appears to have happened,\" he said Tuesday of the administration's argument on the verbal order. \"But maybe that's the case.\"\n\nYoo noted that often judges would make one-word rulings, such as denying motions, which are usually only then found in the written transcript of the proceedings, but he made clear the situation now was vastly different.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented exercise of judicial power, in response to an unprecedented claim of authority by the president,\" Yoo said.\n\nBoasberg is currently considering whether the Trump administration violated his court order, which the White House denies. A Friday hearing on whether to maintain the ban quickly grew contentious when the judge accused DOJ lawyers, without specifics, of being \"disrespectful\" in the court filings. The administration said Boasberg was engaging in a \"judicial fishing expedition,\" according to Reuters.",

It is said to be the world’s largest prostate cancer screening study, said SWNS.\n\nCOMMON CANCER TYPE COULD BE DETECTED WITH NEW BLOOD TEST\n\nLong-term data from this entity consistently shows that PSA screening programs can lead to a 20% reduced risk of dying from prostate cancer.\n\n‘Stark contrast’\n\nNow, an analysis of 20-year follow-up data from the ERSPC is the first to look at the link between the consistent decline of screening invitations and men's risk of dying from this type of cancer.\n\nIt reveals a \"stark contrast\" that emphasizes the potential consequences of screening avoidance.\n\nOf the 72,460 men invited to partake in screenings, around one in six were non-attenders and skipped every appointment.\n\nResearchers from Erasmus MC Cancer Institute at the University Medical Centre in the Netherlands led the analysis, said SWNS.\n\nOf the 72,460 men invited to partake in the screenings, around one in six were non-attenders and skipped every single appointment.\n\nThat group had a 45% higher risk of dying from prostate cancer compared with those who attended screening appointments, according to the findings.\n\nWhen comparing outcomes with the control group – men who were never invited to have screenings – those who attended the screening appointments had a 23% lower risk of dying from prostate cancer, while non-attenders faced a 39% higher risk, SWNS reported.\n\nLead study author Renée Leenen, M.D., Ph.D., said the choice not to participate in screening may be driven by a complex collection of factors.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\nSaid Leenen, who is with the Erasmus CM Cancer Institute in the Netherlands, \"It may be that men who opted not to attend a screening appointment are care avoiders — meaning they’re less likely to engage in healthy behaviors and preventative care in general.\"\n\nExperts \"need to better understand who these men are, why they choose not to attend appointments and how to motivate them.\"\n\nShe added, \"This is the opposite behavior of people who are perhaps more health-conscious and are more likely to attend a screening appointment … Our study identifies that men who were invited for screening, but do not attend screening appointments, are at a significantly higher risk of dying from prostate cancer compared to men who were not offered screening or accepted an invitation for screening.\"\n\nDr. Leenen said that experts \"need to better understand who these men are, why they choose not to attend appointments and how to motivate them.\"\n\nDoing so, she added, \"will help us design population-based prostate cancer screening programs that encourage higher rates of informed participation … Tackling attendance rates in this way could be a big factor in the long-term success of a national prostate screening program,\" SWNS reported.\n\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\nUrologist Tobias Nordström, M.D., Ph.D., of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said, \"We need to better understand why these men might actively choose not to participate in screening, despite being invited to attend, and how this behavior is linked to worse outcomes when they get a diagnosis.\"\n\nThe findings from the study are scheduled to be presented this weekend at the European Association of Urology (EAU) Congress in Madrid, Spain, said SWNS.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel, who was not involved in the new study on prostate cancer risks, previously called out the need for regular medical screenings.\n\nSiegel has emphasized the need to \"diagnose it early for better outcomes.\"\n\nAngelica Stabile of Fox News Digital contributed reporting.",

        "content": "Cassidy Carlisle was in seventh grade when she had to change in the same locker room as a transgender student, she said.\n\nDuring a gym class at Presque Isle Middle School in northern Maine six years ago, she said she walked into the locker room to find a biological male who would change with her and other girls. She alleges she was told by administrators that if she tried to avoid changing with the trans student, she would risk being late to class.\n\n\"That was really my first experience in just knowing that something isn't right, but not knowing what to do with that,\" Carlisle told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. Fox News Digital has reached out to Presque Isle Middle School for comment.\n\nHOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE\n\nGender identity was first included in the Maine Human Rights Act as part of the definition of sexual orientation in 2005. In 2021, the law was amended to add gender identity as its own protected class, joining other protected classes such as sex, sexual orientation, disability, race, color and religion. The law specifically says that denying a person equal opportunity in athletic programs is education discrimination.\n\nThe transgender student was only in the girls locker room for about a week, Carlisle claims, before mysteriously vanishing. But the memory of the experience stuck with her.\n\nThe memory especially stuck with her in her junior year of high school, when she found out she would be competing with a trans athlete on the state Nordic skiing team.\n\nIt was an athlete with whom she was familiar. She had already lost to the trans athlete in cross-country competitions in previous years.\n\nWhen her father told her she would have to face the athlete again in skiing, Carlisle didn't believe it was happening.\n\n\"I was like, ‘Oh, that’s only something I kind of hear about on the news. … It’s not going to happen to me,\" Cassidy recalled.\n\nMAINE UNIVERSITIES AGREE TO KEEP TRANSGENDER ATHLETES OUT OF WOMEN'S SPORTS AFTER TRUMP ADMIN PAUSES FUNDING\n\nBut it did happen to her.\n\n\"The defeat that comes with that in that moment is heartbreaking,\" Carlisle said. \"I'm just in shock in a way. I didn't believe it. … I didn't think it was happening to me.\"\n\nAs a child, Carlisle quit her co-ed hockey team specifically because she felt she \"couldn't keep up\" with the boys. Then, even after committing to a girls-only sport, she couldn't escape the physical disadvantage that came with facing biological males.\n\nMAINE RESPONDS TO TRUMP ADMIN'S DECLARATION STATE VIOLATED TITLE IX BY ALLOWING TRANSGENDERS IN GIRLS SPORTS\n\nOn top of the anxiety of the situation, Carlisle felt like she couldn't speak out about it.\n\n\"I stayed silent for a while,\" Carlisle said. \"It's very hard to speak up if you don't have a platform to do it on. … Backlash is a huge thing. I'm a high school student. No high school student wants to be hurt or yelled at or said mean comments by people. And the reality of it, with the state that I live in, that could very much happen.\"\n\nWhat she could do was vote in the November election. As a first-time voter, she cast her ballot with the issue of trans athletes in girls sports at the forefront.\n\nA national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls and women’s bathrooms\" as important to them.\n\nAnd 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\"\n\nWhen Republican Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby spoke out earlier this year against another trans athlete who won a girls pole vault competition in February, Carlisle suddenly gained an opportunity to influence the issue.\n\nTRUMP ADMIN RESPONDS TO MAINE'S RELUCTANCE TO BAN TRANS ATHLETES FROM GIRLS SPORTS\n\nLibby's social media post identifying the trans athlete thrust the entire state into an ongoing culture war. It became ground zero for a national battle over the issue waged by the Trump administration against several Democrat-controlled states like Maine after Trump signed an executive order to address the issue Feb. 5.\n\nAll of a sudden, thousands of people in Maine were speaking out against the state's laws that enable trans inclusion in girls sports and locker rooms, all with the backing of the president.\n\nSo Carlisle joined in.\n\nOn Feb. 27, Carlisle made a trip to the White House with several other current and former female athletes who have been affected by trans inclusion, including Payton McNabb and Selina Soule. There, they met with Attorney General Pam Bondi and several other state attorneys general and shared their stories.\n\nCarlisle couldn't help but notice an absence at the White House that day,\n\n\"None of our AGs were there from our state,\" Carlisle said.\n\nSo, when Carlisle returned to her state, she took matters into her own hands.\n\nLast weekend, she delivered a speech in front of the Maine Capitol, speaking to hundreds of other residents there to protest Gov. Janet Mills for her continued enabling of trans athletes in girls sports.\n\nIt was the second protest against Mills outside the Capitol in a month after the March on Mills rally March 1.\n\nThe Trump administration is taking aggressive measures to get the state to adhere to the wishes of Carlisle and other residents who want females protected from trans inclusion.\n\nOn March 17, the Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights (OCR) announced that if found the Maine Department of Education, the Maine Principals' Association and Greely High School in violation of Title IX for continuing to enable trans inclusion in girls sports.\n\nIn the announcement, the department said Maine had 10 days to correct its policies through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump has already shown a willingness to cut federal funding to enforce these policies. He paused $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania and temporarily paused funding to the University of Maine System last week until a review had found the system was in full compliance with Trump's orders.\n\nThe deadline for the rest of Maine to comply is coming up within the week.\n\n\"I really hope that Maine complies because our schools need the federal funding, and we can't risk losing that,\" Carlisle said. \"It would really really hurt our state to lose that federal funding. So, I hope our government can get it together.\"",

USA!\" amid the president's presence. A few fans booed when Trump walked in.\n\nElon Musk, OutKick founder Clay Travis, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Education Secretary and former WWE executive Linda McMahon, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Sen. Dave McCormick, R-Pa., and several other Trump allies were in the front row stands to greet the president as well.\n\nFor the president, it marks another stop on his tour of major sporting events in what has been a sports-focused presidency.\n\nTrump is there to potentially witness sports history. Penn State is looking to extend its streak to four straight national titles. It would be the third time Penn State has won four straight championships since 2011. Only Iowa and Ohio State have interrupted the Nittany Lions' run of dominance.\n\nAnd Penn State is firmly in the driver's seat to do it, leading with 169 points, 60 points ahead of second-place Nebraska.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"We're going to the big fight. … They have the NCAA, world, wrestling for college. And I've always supported the wrestlers,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House Friday. \"So, I want to support them. These are the great college wrestlers from the various schools. I think Penn State is leading, and Nebraska is in second place right now. And a lot of good things.\"\n\nTravis broke the news Tuesday that Trump would attend the event when he said in an X post that he would be traveling with the president on Air Force One to the championships.\n\nThe White House confirmed Friday that Trump would attend the event.\n\nLA TIMES WRITERS SUGGEST WORLD SERIES CHAMPION DODGERS SHOULD SKIP WHITE HOUSE VISIT: 'THANKS, BUT NO'\n\nJordan was a wrestling champion in high school and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he won an NCAA Division I men's wrestling title twice. He was later an assistant coach with Ohio State University's wrestling program from 1987 to 1995.\n\nMcCormick previously confirmed that Trump would be in attendance at the event in the senator's home state of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I’m thrilled to be in Philadelphia this weekend with [Trump] for the [NCAA Wrestling] Championship,\" McCormick wrote on X. \"I grew up wrestling in small towns across PA and at West Point. It taught me grit, resilience, and hard work.\"\n\nThis will be the second time in three years President Donald Trump has attended the NCAA wrestling championships. He also attended in 2023 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nTrump has been seen at a few different sporting events since winning the election in November.\n\nTrump attended the Daytona 500 in February and became the first sitting president to attend two Daytona 500 races at Daytona International Speedway. He first attended the race in February 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump participated in prerace festivities, riding in \"The Beast\" for a lap before the race, and he had a special message for drivers that was broadcast on their radios.\n\nEarlier in February, Trump became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. When Trump was shown at the stadium, a raucous cheer was heard on the FOX broadcast from the crowd.\n\nIn December, Trump attended the 125th edition of the Army-Navy game with Vice President JD Vance, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.\n\nTrump attended the annual rivalry game throughout his first presidency, first attending in 2016, shortly after winning that year's election. He was also at the game during each year of his presidency, including in 2020 at West Point.\n\nA couple of weeks after Trump won the election over Vice President Kamala Harris in November, he attended UFC 309.\n\nTrump sat cage-side alongside Elon Musk, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald Trump Jr. and others.\n\nJon Jones defeated Stipe Miocic via knockout and did Trump's signature dance move, pointing to Trump and giving his UFC heavyweight championship belt to Trump to hold.",

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "Gemelli Hospital medical director Dr. Sergio Alfieri announced Saturday that Pope Francis is expected to be discharged on Sunday.\n\nThe Vatican also announced that the pontiff would appear publicly on Sunday morning to bless the faithful from his 10th floor suite at the hospital. He will then return to the Vatican.\n\nAt a press conference, Alfieri said the Holy Father experienced \"two very critical episodes\" during his hospitalization when his life was in danger but has since shown a \"slow but progressive\" improvement due to \"pharmacological therapy, the administration of high flow oxygen and assisted mechanical ventilation.\" The pope, however, was never intubated and never lost consciousness, Alfieri said.\n\nAlfieri said Saturday that Francis will require at least two months of rest and rehabilitation as he continues recovering back at the Vatican. He said doctors advise the pontiff not to meet large groups or activities in public during that recovery time.\n\nAlfieri was joined by the head physician of the Vatican's Health and Hygiene Office, Luigi Carbone, and the pope's spokesperson, Matteo Bruni, in the entry hall of Rome's Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic, where Pope Francis has been treated since Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened. The pope was hospitalized for 38 days while battling a life-threatening case of pneumonia in both lungs, his doctors said.\n\nKING CHARLES III TO MEET POPE FRANCIS DURING VISIT TO VATICAN NEXT MONTH\n\nThe pope experienced \"acute respiratory failure due to a polymicrobial infection,\" Alfieri said.\n\nThe Saturday evening briefing was the first in-person update on the pontiff's condition since Feb. 21, a week after the 88-year-old Francis was brought to Gemelli hospital. He subsequently experienced several respiratory crises that landed him in critical condition, though he has since stabilized. Due to the double pneumonia, Alfieri told reporters that the pope's voice has been damaged but that it will improve with time.\n\nThe doctor added that recovery would best continue away from the hospital, where exposure to viruses risks weakening the Holy Father's condition. Alfieri said the pope did not have COVID-19, but he had been exposed to various viruses.\n\nWhile Francis released an audio message on March 6 and the Vatican distributed a photo of him March 16, Sunday’s blessing will be the first live appearance since Francis was admitted on Feb. 14 for what has become the longest hospitalization of his 12-year papacy. The Argentine pope, who has chronic lung disease, is prone to respiratory problems in winter and had part of one lung removed as a young man.\n\n\n\nWhen the pope was admitted, doctors first diagnosed a complex bacterial, viral and fungal respiratory tract infection and soon thereafter, pneumonia in both lungs.\n\nBlood tests showed signs of anemia, low blood platelets and the onset of kidney failure, all of which were later resolved after two blood transfusions, according to officials.\n\nThe most serious setbacks began on Feb. 28, when Francis experienced an acute coughing fit and inhaled vomit, requiring him to use a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask to help him breathe. He suffered two more respiratory crises in the following days, which required doctors to manually aspirate the mucus, at which point he began sleeping with the ventilation mask at night to help his lungs clear the accumulation of fluids.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOver the past two weeks, the Vatican press office reported that the pope has stabilized, no longer needs to wear the ventilation mask at night, and is cutting back his reliance on high flows of supplemental oxygen during the day.\n\nAlfieri said the pope does not have double pneumonia anymore but still has some infections and must continue to heal.\n\nFox News' Courteney Walsh and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter shocked fans with her latest explicit dance move at her recent concert in Paris.\n\nDuring every show on her \"Short n' Sweet\" world tour, the 25-year-old singer simulates a different sexual position while performing her hit \"Juno.\" Carpenter shows off each move when she sings the lyrics, \"Wanna try out some freaky positions? / Have you ever tried this one?\"\n\nOn Monday night, Carpenter paid tribute to the City of Lights when she and two male backup dancers simulated a three-way sex act, known as the Eiffel Tower.\n\nIn a photo from the performance that the account Buzzing Pop posted on X, Carpenter, who donned a sparkly green and silver halter top with a matching miniskirt, was seen bending over between the two dancers who leaned into her and held hands above her. The position is meant to emulate the structure of Paris' famed historical landmark.\n\nSABRINA CARPENTER BLASTS CRITICS OF HER SKIMPY TOUR OUTFITS: ‘DON'T COME TO THE SHOW'\n\nThe post divided fans when it went viral on social media, with some fans slamming Carpenter's performance as too inappropriate for the younger members of her fan base, while others contended that she had the right to evolve as an artist after transitioning to adulthood.\n\nDoug Eldridge of Achilles PR weighed in on the challenges that child stars face when trying to shed their former images as they grow up. He pointed out that young performers often become tightly associated with the roles that made them famous and fans can have a difficult time letting go of the characters that they loved.\n\n\"There are two 'doomsday' scenarios for every entertainer: being typecast and not getting call-backs,\" Eldridge told Fox News Digital.\n\nHe continued, \"For young stars (like from Disney's Mickey Mouse Club and others), getting typecast becomes an almost paradoxical situation: you eventually age out of the role that created your stardom, yet you are too closely tied to that character/role to reliably be cast for other roles.\n\n\"It's the entertainment equivalent of purgatory — you can't stay here, and you can't go anywhere else.\"\n\nThe PR expert explained that some former child stars and teen idols deliberately rebrand by embracing a persona that is the opposite of their established images, but warned that the move can backfire.\n\n\"Often times, you'll see a former child star try to forcibly break the Disney paradigm, either by doing racy photo shoots, or they try to force a rebrand that is a marked departure from their youth-based identity and presumed family-friendly values,\" Eldridge said.\n\n\"Unfortunately for the entertainer, this is rarely met with approval or support from the fan base that still sees them as the adorable young actor who delivered the memorable one-liners,\" he said.\n\nEldridge told Fox News Digital that when a rebrand is unsuccessful, the fault can lie with the teams behind the stars who failed to adequately prepare for their smooth transition to a more mature identity that will be accepted by the public.\n\n\"It's the entertainment equivalent of purgatory — you can't stay here, and you can't go anywhere else.\" — Doug Eldridge\n\n\"Sadly, agents and managers rarely establish a 'brand arc' for child stars to evolve into new roles, as they age up (or age out) in Hollywood,\" he said.\n\n\"Miley Cyrus is a good example of someone who managed to carve her own path and, in so doing, remain true to her original fan base, while establishing a brand-new audience that has embraced her as an adult. Again, simple, not easy.\"\n\nWhile Carpenter's career has recently reached new heights, her provocative Paris stunt has drawn a mixed reaction from fans.\n\nThe ambivalence was evident in the replies to Buzzing Pop's post about Carpenter's performance, where X users expressed both outrage and support.\n\n\"I’m sorry but there are little kids in the audience and this is taking it way too far,\" one commented, while another added, \"Promoting sex positions to a primarily underage age audience? I stan her but this isn’t ok…\"\n\n\"'Blame the parents,' but why isn't there an age limit on her concerts? If it's not meant for kids, why are they still taking their money and letting them in? Just make it 18+ already,\" a social media user argued.\n\nHowever, other social media users came to Carpenter's defense, noting that the two-time Grammy nominee should be allowed to evolve from the early days of her career.\n\nCarpenter rose to fame at the age of 14 when she was cast in the Disney Channel TV series \"Girl Meets World.\" She starred in the leading role of Maya Hart in the \"Boy Meets World\" spinoff from 2014 to 2017.\n\nThe pop star has openly embraced a much more mature image since becoming an adult. In August 2024, Carpenter released her sixth studio album, \"Short n' Sweet,\" which topped the Billboard 200 chart for three consecutive weeks and has been certified platinum.\n\nMany of the songs on the album feature overly sexual lyrics and racy innuendos. Carpenter's defenders on X argued that it is the parents' responsibility to verify that her music and performances are age-appropriate for their children.\n\n\"People who take their kids to a Sabrina Carpenter concert after she’s been VERY open and does this sort of position at EVERY concert that is VERY publically (sic) available to see have no right to say anything against it,\" one fan wrote.\n\n\"If you bring your kids to her shows that’s on you.. have u LISTENED to her music,\" another pointed out.\n\n\"Her music is not for children and if you as a parent don’t monitor what your kids are listening to that’s your fault,\" one social media user commented, with another adding, \"Her shows and her music are obviously targeted towards women in her age range and up.. if you think she’s making music for children you’re weird.\"\n\nCarpenter is far from the first Disney alum to face backlash after shifting away from their teen idol images. As Eldridge noted, Cyrus sparked controversy when the former \"Hannah Montana\" star debuted her song \"Wrecking Ball\" and its accompanying explicit music video.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\n\"The Wizards of Waverly Place\" alum Selena Gomez and \"High School Musical\" star Vanessa Hudgens also came under fire when they starred in the R-rated crime comedy \"Spring Breakers.\"\n\nHowever, PR and branding expert Eric Schiffer shared his view that former child stars don't have the duty to maintain their kid-friendly images and target audiences indefinitely.\n\n\"Sabrina Carpenter's risqué performances aren't a betrayal of her young fans; they're an invite for them to grow up alongside her,\" Schiffer, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, told Fox News Digital. \"Sabrina Carpenter’s latest stage antics don’t just push boundaries — they bulldoze them. She traded Mickey Mouse carnage for shock, and it works.\"\n\n\"Disney stars don't sign lifetime contracts of innocence,\" he noted. \"Sabrina proves growing up isn't a crime — even if she makes parents cringe and condemn her. In a deathmatch between the danger to Disney nostalgia and adult authenticity, Sabrina Carpenter chose authenticity. Fans and critics need to accept rebranding means childhood is gone.\"\n\nSABRINA CARPENTER BLASTS CRITICS OF HER SKIMPY TOUR OUTFITS: ‘DON'T COME TO THE SHOW'\n\nSchiffer added, \"Childhood fame shouldn't be a life sentence; Disney stars should be free to reinvent themselves. Stars like Carpenter aren't betraying their past — they're reclaiming their future.\"\n\nLongtime Hollywood publicist Steve Honig noted that artists should ultimately be in control of their own brands, though he warned that they should understand the potential risks and rewards that could come with changing their images.\n\n\"Performers who at one point had a young following should not be obligated to keep catering to a young demographic,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"As these performers get older and their talent evolves, so does their audience.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nHonig continued, \"Performers have the right to decide the direction of their careers, just like parents have the right to decide if it’s appropriate content for their children. There are many performers who at one point were targeting a young demographic that have successfully rebranded and reinvented themselves with young adult and adult audiences.\"\n\n\"Artists need to establish and understand their brand, accurately communicate that brand to audiences and then those audiences, or in some cases the parents of those audiences, get to decide if it’s appropriate for them,\" he added.\n\n\"The artist, however, does need to understand there may be consequences to changing their image and, generally speaking, you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.\"\n\nCarpenter previously defended herself against blistering criticism from British songwriters and producers Pete Waterman and Matt Stock.\n\n\"To see Sabrina Carpenter dressed as a little girl is quite offensive. She doesn’t need that,\" Waterman told The Sun in January.\n\n\"She’s got great talent and yet the whole of the industry, these girls come out in as little as possible because they know they’re driving young boys to their websites,\" he added.\n\nWhile speaking with the outlet, Stock said he viewed Carpenter's sexual lyrics as \"lazy.\"\n\n\"I would never try to write a lyric that said anything specific on a sexual level,\" he said. \"You’d always be allegorical or allude to it somehow. So I don’t like that. I think it’s a bad show and it’s lazy. You’re going to grab some form of attention by doing that.\"\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDays later, Carpenter fired back at the disparaging remarks during an interview with the same outlet on Sunday.\n\n\"Female artists have been shamed forever,\" she said. \"In the noughties it was Rihanna, in the nineties it was Britney Spears, in the eighties it was Madonna — and now it’s me. It’s essentially saying that female performers should not be able to embrace their sexuality in their lyrics, in the way we dress, in the way we perform.\"\n\n\"It is totally regressive,\" Carpenter continued. \"It’s like those who want to shame don’t make comments when I talk about self-care or body ­positivity or heartbreak, which are all normal things a 25-year-old goes through. They just want to talk about the ­sexual side of my performances.\"\n\n\"My message has always been clear — if you can’t handle a girl who is confident in her own sexuality, then don’t come to my shows,\" the \"Espresso\" hitmaker said.",

        "content": "Donald Trump has pushed out roughly 4,7000 executive orders since retaking the White House in January.\n\nHe's killed DEI – and Jackie Robinson, by accident!\n\nHe's lowered the price of eggs, despite MSNBC refusing to cover it.\n\nHe's given us the Gulf of America, fairer trade (still a work in progress), demolished the insufferable Department of Education, and saved women from getting pummeled by men between the hashes.\n\nAll great things, no doubt, and he's just getting started. Wait till he abolishes income tax sometime around the Fourth of July!\n\nBut none of it – and I mean NONE OF IT – compares to him forcing the lunatic Hollywood elites to flee the country. And while Ellen DeGeneres skipping town was/is great, it doesn't hold a candle to mentally-ill Rosie O'Donnell escaping to Ireland earlier this month.\n\nSpeaking of … let's check in with Rosie on her 63rd birthday!\n\nRosie O'Donnell is crushing Ireland!\n\nGood God. Rosie! Blink twice if you're being held hostage! Hold up a newspaper with today's date, PLEASE! I hear the Irish Times is a good one.\n\nLet's get to some of the hits from this 10-minute goldmine:\n\n\"I feel healthier, I’m sleeping better without the stress and anxiety over what was happening politically in the country.\"\n\n\"We felt, as a family, this was the safest and best thing for us to do. Sadly, it looks like we were correct.\"\n\n\"What's happening in the United States is overwhelmingly depressing, unconstitutional, illegal, criminal, and I'm so, so very sad.\"\n\n\"Let's hope the world and the nation rally against the current administration for their horrific ideas for what will make America great again. And it's not racism! And it's not homophobia. It's equality for all!\"\n\nJust a home run here from Rosie, who spends the rest of her time talking about how less fat she is. If that interests you, by all means, continue watching. I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nAnyway, good stuff all around. Sounds like Rosie is enjoying Ireland!\n\nWonder if she'll be voting for Conor McGregor in the next election? God, I would LOVE that. Could you imagine the absolute horror Rosie O'Donnell would face if she fled the USA because of Trump, only to fall under a Conor McGregor administration? PLEASE let it happen. Please, please, please.\n\nIn any event … Happy Birthday, Rosie! We miss ya.\n\nGood luck, Ireland.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump said former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, contributed to the Democrats' loss in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump’s comments came in response to statements Walz provided in a podcast with California Gov. Gavin Newsom that aired on Tuesday, in which Walz predicted he could kick the \"a--\" of most Trump supporters.\n\n\"Well, he's a loser. Yeah. No, I think so. He lost an election,\" Trump said Friday in the Oval Office of the White House. \"He played a part. You know, usually a vice president doesn't play a part. They say. I think Tim played a part. I think he was so bad that he hurt her. But she hurt herself. And Joe hurt them both. They didn't have a great group, but I would probably put him at the bottom of the group.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Walz did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\n\nWWE LEGEND KANE, NOW A TENNESSEE MAYOR, CHALLENGES TIM WALZ TO CHARITY WRESTLING MATCH AFTER GOV'S BOLD CLAIMS\n\nWalz’s comments originated during a discussion with Newsom about toxic masculinity. While Newsom discussed why he has brought on conservative figures like Charlie Kirk on his podcast because he believes one shouldn’t write someone off for having different views, Walz questioned how to challenge Trump backers.\n\n\"How do you fight it? I think I could kick most of their a--. I do think that,\" Walz said in response. \"But I don’t know if we’re going to fall into that place where we want to— okay, we challenge you to a WWE fight here type thing.\"\n\nWalz also told Newsom he believes \"I scare them a little bit\" and that he's received scrutiny from Republicans, prompting Newsom to laugh.\n\n\"No, I’m serious, because they know I can fix a truck, they know I’m not bulls—-ing on this,\" Walz said.\n\nGAVIN NEWSOM ASKS CHARLIE KIRK TO GIVE HIS PARTY ‘ADVICE’ IN ONE-ON-ONE PODCAST INTERVIEW\n\nMeanwhile, Walz received some criticism for his comments on the podcast.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner, a trans woman formerly known as Bruce Jenner and former Olympic gold-medal decathlete, joked in an X post of being more \"masculine\" than Walz.\n\nVice President JD Vance also addressed Walz’ comments in an interview with The Daily Caller’s Vince Coglianese that aired Thursday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I have to say, Vince, I was never physically intimidated by Tim Walz,\" Vance said.\n\nVance also addressed speculation that Walz may attempt to run for the U.S. Senate, following his bid as Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election.\n\n\"I’m not too worried about Tim Walz as a political talent,\" Vance said.",

        "content": "As more patrons of food service establishments embrace the Make America Healthy Again movement today, more restaurants also appear to be answering the call by promising seed oil-free dining experiences.\n\nBut while plenty of restaurants can claim to be free of seed oil, there hasn't really been a way to reassure customers officially of that – until now.\n\nThe Seed Oil Free Alliance was founded in 2023 \"to raise awareness, improve transparency and educate consumers about the prevalence of seed oils in our food supply,\" according to the group's website.\n\nEVERYTHING TO KNOW ABOUT MAHA\n\nCo-founders Corey Nelson and Jonathan Rubin discovered that \"there was no certification to verify that foods are actually seed oil-free,\" Nelson told Fox News Digital.\n\nThey soon \"realized there was an opportunity here to not only help consumers, but also to help companies – because it's more expensive to eliminate seed oils from most foods.\"\n\nThe Seed Oil Free Alliance, based in Florida, is an independent certifying organization with a coalition of public health and nutrition experts as advisors.\n\n\"Any legitimate certification body does have certifying standards,\" Nelson said.\n\nThose range from pre-certification testing to \"post-certification surveillance where we can actually test foods once they're on the shelf,\" he said, \"to ensure that companies are doing what they say that they're doing and that consumers can trust the seal.\"\n\nRESTAURANT CHAIN DITCHES SEED OILS 'LURKING' IN ITS INGREDIENTS\n\nAll foods and restaurants with the seal undergo laboratory testing to ensure they are free from all seed oils, including soybean, corn and canola oil.\n\nOlive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, butter and other refined animal fats are permitted.\n\nSometimes, seed oils are detected within ingredients that restaurant owners didn't anticipate.\n\n\"We give them the choice,\" Nelson told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"You know, you can walk away, no harm done, if it's not the right time to make the switch. Often, companies do switch, so then we have this opportunity to help them meet our standards.\"\n\n‘Not just the oil we were using’\n\nErin Leeds, who owns the Garden Butcher in Boca Raton, Florida, said her restaurant was on track last year to be the first restaurant to receive the certification – that is, until the avocado oil she was using didn't pass the rigorous lab testing.\n\nOHIO RESTAURANT OWNER PUTS FOCUS ON HEALTHY, WHOLE FOODS AND 'TRUST'\n\n\"The tests indicated that [it was] not just the oil we were using, but many other avocado oils we were willing to switch to — all were adulterated in some way [and] suspected to have traces of sunflower oil,\" Leeds told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Where there's a will, there's a way.\"\n\nAfter over six months of trying to find a cost-effective solution, Leeds made progress with the help of Nelson and Rubin. She turned to algae oil from a company in California.\n\n\"We bring in two pallets of algae oil every couple of months and use a storage facility to hold them,\" Leeds said. \"Where there's a will, there's a way.\"\n\nOn the other side of the country, Jennifer Peters had been going through the same testing at her Colorado restaurant.\n\nCOOKING OIL LINKED TO COLON CANCER IN EARLY STUDY, TIED TO INFLAMMATION\n\nAfter doing so, Just BE Kitchen became the first restaurant in America to receive the certification. (See the video at the top of this article.)\n\nPeters said she was in the process of opening a second location when Nelson and Rubin gave her the news.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"They actually called and said, 'Oh, you know what? There was oil adulteration in another company's oil and yours has passed. So you're the first restaurant that's seed oil-free certified,'\" Peters told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"That was pretty cool,\" she added.\n\nThe Seed Oil Free Alliance doesn't just certify restaurants, though.\n\nProducts like TruBar – a snack food made with all-natural ingredients like cassava flour and brown rice protein – have also received the certification.\n\n\"I knew that I wanted to make that change.\"\n\n\"I knew I wanted to change,\" Florida resident Erica Groussman, who owns TruBar, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We only had a very small amount in our bars, but I knew that I wanted to make that change.\"\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\nWhile businesses must pay a fee to become certified, Nelson said the price points \"work really well for emerging brands like in the packaged foods industry or mom-and-pop-size restaurants.\"\n\n\"I think from the consumer perspective, restaurants and packaged foods are equally important if you're looking to avoid seed oils,\" Nelson said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"But I think from the owner perspective, it's just much harder to get all the seed oils out of a restaurant as opposed to a packaged food.\"\n\nThe goal, ultimately, Nelson said, \"is to advocate and advance the availability of seed oil-free food options.\"",

I’ll say this: I look forward to dying,\" Weir, 77, told Rolling Stone.\n\n\"I tend to think of death as the last and best reward for a life well-lived. That’s it. I’ve still got a lot on my plate, and I won’t be ready to go for a while.\"\n\nWhile Weir has showed no signs of slowing down, he witnessed several deaths of his band members, including bassist Phil Lesh and guitarist Jerry Garcia.\n\n\"I wish … well, Phil made it to his eighties.

Since Lesh’s passing, Weir is now unsure of a band reunion.\n\n\"We speak a language that nobody else speaks,\" Weir explained. \"We communicate, we kick stuff back and forth, and then make our little statement in a more universal language.\"\n\nHe continued, \"For us, it’s a look or a motion with one shoulder, or the way you reflect a phrase or something that tips off the other guys where you’re going with this. And then they work on being where you’re headed, getting there with a little surprise for you. That’s a formula that’s worked real well for us over the years, and there just aren’t enough of us left now to do that anymore.\"\n\nHowever, this month, Weir returned to Las Vegas for another Dead & Company residency with 18 shows at the Sphere.\n\n\"That’s what I do,\" he said. \"That’s what I’m here for.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nMeanwhile, in October 2024, Lesh’s death was confirmed on his official Instagram page.\n\n\"Phil brought immense joy to everyone around him and leaves behind a legacy of music and love,\" his social media read at the time.\n\nAPP USERS CLICK HERE TO VIEW POST\n\n\"When Phil's happening, the band's happening,\" Grateful Dead co-founder, frontman and lead guitarist Garcia, who died in 1995, once said of Lesh's bass playing.\n\nThe Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995 after Garcia's death, but Lesh continued to perform into his 80s, often with his son Grahame Lesh.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLesh and Garcia first met in 1959, and after reconnecting in 1964, Garcia invited Lesh to join the group, then called the Warlocks.

The monarch is the head of the Commonwealth, whose maintenance was a major priority of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMembership is voluntary.\n\nThe U.S. was part of the British Empire before winning independence after the Revolution.\n\nIndia was the first country to decide to remain within the Commonwealth after gaining independence in 1947.\n\nTrump had a friendly relationship with the late queen and always spoke highly of her.\n\n\"I got to know her very well, and, you know, I got to know her in her '90s, OK, but she was great,\" Trump told Fox News’ Mark Levin in 2023. \"This is a woman … 75 years she reigned, and she never made a mistake.\"\n\nTrump has also praised Charles and the heir to the throne, Prince William, whom he met with in December in Paris, but he had fewer nice things to say about Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle.\n\nTRUMP ACCEPTS SECOND STATE VISIT TO UK, REVEALS LETTER FROM KING CHARLES\n\nThe president is scheduled to meet with King Charles during a rare second state visit later this year. He met with the late queen and Charles during his first state visit in 2019.\n\nThe Daily Mail said Commonwealth membership was first floated during Trump’s first term, and this time around the hope is that it would ease tensions between the U.S. and Canada as the countries trade tariff threats.\n\n\"This is being discussed at the highest levels,\" a member of the Royal Commonwealth Society told the Daily Mail. \"It would be a wonderful move that would symbolize Britain's close relationship with the U.S.\n\n\"Donald Trump loves Britain and has great respect for the royal family, so we believe he would see the benefits of this. Associate membership could, hopefully, be followed by full membership, making the Commonwealth even more important as a global organization.\"\n\nLate last month, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented Trump with Charles’ invitation for a second state visit while the two politicians were meeting in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I think that just symbolizes the strength of the relationship between us. This is a very special letter. I think the last state visit was a tremendous success,\" Starmer said. \"His majesty the king wants to make this even better than that.\"\n\nTrump responded, \"The answer is yes.

        "title": "Dear Chuck Schumer, the 'old' Republican Party is never coming back",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This summer will mark 10 years since Donald Trump first descended the escalator at Trump Tower to announce his candidacy for president of the United States.\n\nNow, two months into his second term, it’s becoming painfully clear that many of the people best positioned to push back against his agenda still haven't accepted how much the world has changed.\n\nThe latest example came from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer in \"Mad House,\" an upcoming book from Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater of The New York Times, which revealed a 2023 exchange in which he said Trump was an aberration.\n\n“Here’s my hope … after this election, when the Republican Party expels the turd of Donald Trump, it will go back to being the old Republican Party,\" he said, according to the book.\n\nThere are a lot of things wrong with this quote other than its needlessly vivid imagery.\n\nI remember the “old” Republican Party well. I was its chairman in 2009 shortly after the transformative victory of President Barack Obama and Democratic dominance in both chambers of Congress. The late Sen. John McCain had been the party’s nominee in 2008 and then-Gov. Mitt Romney would be its nominee in the next cycle.\n\nThese former figureheads of the party are now considered by Trump’s acolytes as RINOs, Republicans in Name Only. MAGA Republicans fantasize about McCain roasting in hell. Conservative heavy-hitters like Matt Schlapp say Romney’s physical safety would be jeopardized if he so much as attended the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nThe \"old\" Republican Party is gone. It sold its soul to Trump in return for two presidencies and three Supreme Court seats.\n\nOne by one, the Republicans who stood up to Trump in the beginning have either left politics or capitulated, often in humiliating fashion.\n\nAfter Trump insulted his wife’s appearance and lied about his father during the 2016 presidential primary, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could have continued calling Trump out as a “sniveling coward.” Instead, he became one of his sniveling supporters.\n\nWhen Trump dragged him into a stomach-turning exchange about genital size on a national debate stage, then-Sen. Marco Rubio could have insisted to Republican voters that their rhetoric had to rise above Trump’s brazen behavior. Instead, he now serves as Trump’s Secretary of State.\n\nTrump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives.\n\nSome of this is careerism. Trump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives, which leaves those who want to remain in elected office with a choice: debase themselves to gain power or stick to their principles and be cast aside like Romney and McCain.\n\nBut the truth is Republicans capitulate even when it's not necessary. Far too many of today’s Republicans are unwilling to call out Trump's seedy dealings with Russia, heed warnings about the perils of relying too heavily on tariffs or stand with law enforcement over pro-Trump extremists — all positions that are unpopular with broad swaths of voters.\n\nAnother reason the Republican Party I once led is never seeing a revival? Republican voters don’t want to revive it. In fact, MAGA officials repeatedly race to outdo each others’ depravity because they know today’s Republican voters will reward them for it.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, who once envisioned a Republican Party that carved out space for LGBTQ+ rights, now fundraises on a bizarre obsession with trans people’s bathroom habits.\n\nFar-right Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once considered a fringe conspiracy theorist by people with multiple brain cells, is now one of the party's leading political figures and the top congressional fundraiser in her state.\n\nEven Trump’s most unhinged Cabinet picks were awarded confirmations not despite their lack of experience or support for conspiracy theories, but because of them.\n\nAnd there’s Trump, whose criminal indictments and even convictions became a cause célèbre and his highest fundraising days of the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe old Republican Party is not coming back. Those bridges have been burned by Republicans. The sooner Schumer and those Republicans interested in the re-emergence of traditional republicanism understand this reality, the sooner we move on from Trumpism. But sitting back and waiting for the GOP to \"expel\" Trump won't change a thing.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Michael Steele, Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend, watch “The Weekend” every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Columbia University has agreed to most of the demands issued last week by the government, setting the stage to begin negotiations on restoring $400 million in federal funding and becoming the latest institution to capitulate to President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a memo issued Friday afternoon, the university said it will ban face masks “for the purpose of concealing one’s identity”; hire 36 “special officers” empowered to arrest students and remove them from campus; appoint a senior vice provost to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies; adopt a formal definition of antisemitism; review its admission procedures to ensure those processes are “unbiased”; and commit to “greater institutional neutrality” — most of which address demands from the Trump administration.\n\nIn early March, the administration pulled $400 million in federal grants from the university, citing its “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” The administration subsequently issued a list of demands to Columbia “as a precondition for formal negotiations.”\n\nThe government’s demand that Columbia place its Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department under “academic receivership” was particularly alarming. Academics told The New York Times they had never witnessed such a blatant effort by the federal government to intervene in a private institution.\n\nThe Trump administration’s targeting of Columbia forced the university into a difficult corner. Katrina Armstrong, Columbia’s interim president, said that the loss of the federal funds would have an immediate impact “on research and other critical functions of the University, impacting students, faculty, staff, research, and patient care.”\n\nStill, Columbia’s sweeping concessions to the administration represent a remarkable moment in academia — and in the university’s history. Academics at Columbia and beyond have expressed dismay at the precedent the school is setting as Trump continues his effort to put educational institutions under his heel.\n\nJameel Jaffer, the director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, responded to the news in a social media post: “A sad day for Columbia and for our democracy.”\n\nThe administration could ultimately decide not to restore federal funds to Columbia, despite the university’s submission to its demands. Neither Trump nor the White House has publicly responded to the announcement of Columbia’s policy changes.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has railed in recent weeks against federal judges who have ruled against his administration, painting them as threats to the country and demanding that the Supreme Court halt all nationwide injunctions.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social Thursday, Trump attacked the judges who have issued injunctions against his policies, calling them “radical left judges” and “lunatics” who “want to assume the Powers of the Presidency, without having to attain 80 Million Votes.” (Trump won the 2024 election with 77 million votes, and federal judges are appointed to their positions, not elected.)\n\n“STOP NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” he added, before calling on Chief Justice John Roberts to intervene. “If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!”\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump again suggested in a Truth Social post that federal judges are attempting to “assume the duties of the President of the United States.”\n\nWith more than 100 lawsuits against Trump’s policies to date, the administration has claimed that judges are improperly using nationwide injunctions to impede the president’s agenda and to override his executive powers. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused those judges of being “partisan activists.”\n\n“They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States,” she said. “They are trying to clearly slow-walk this administration’s agenda, and it’s unacceptable.”\n\nNationwide injunctions have stymied both Republican and Democratic presidents in the past. However, Trump and his allies argue that his administration has faced more injunctions than any other in recent decades. According to the Harvard Law Review, Trump faced 64 injunctions in his first term in office, far more than any president since 2001.\n\nBut Trump has wielded executive power in ways that other presidents have not, and in his second term, he has aggressively sought to expand the boundaries of his office. As my colleague Steve Benen pointed out, Republicans are leaning on the assumption that courts are engaged in a widespread conspiracy to undermine Trump’s agenda, rather than face the more straightforward explanation that his actions may simply be at odds with the law.\n\nNevertheless, the president and his billionaire ally Elon Musk have also called for judges who rule against the administration to be impeached, which provoked Roberts to take the rare step of issuing a statement saying “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”\n\nThe Justice Department is currently awaiting the Supreme Court’s ruling on a request to narrow orders from several judges who have blocked Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order from taking effect nationwide. But as The Associated Press pointed out, the high court appears to be in no hurry to decide.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Welcome back, Deadline: Legal Newsletter readers. We started the week with more questions about the Trump administration’s compliance with court orders. The government’s answers haven’t impressed Washington, D.C.’s chief federal trial judge, James Boasberg. When President Donald Trump called for impeaching the judge, Chief Justice John Roberts made a rare public statement, reiterating that the proper response to an adverse ruling is an appeal, not an impeachment.\n\n“Woefully insufficient” is what Boasberg called the Justice Department’s latest explanation on Thursday. He had ordered the government to halt deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century law that Trump invoked to summarily remove alleged Venezuelan gang members. But while the administration appeals Boasberg's temporary restraining orders, the judge is examining whether officials deliberately flouted his orders. At a hearing Friday, he said he’ll get to the bottom of whether they were violated and what the consequences will be.\n\nThe judge gave the government until Tuesday to file a brief explaining how it didn’t violate his orders by failing to return people removed from the U.S. on planes last weekend. We’ll be following the latest compliance saga into next week while litigation moves forward on the DOJ’s bid to overturn the judge’s restraining orders, with a federal appeals court hearing set for Monday.\n\nCalls to impeach judges like Boasberg who rule against Trump aren't a new phenomenon in his second term. But they have escalated with the president’s backing and support from the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, who helped return Trump to the White House. And while threats to judges rise, Musk is financially backing Republicans who support judicial impeachments.\n\nMusk’s effective merger with the government is at least one of the biggest stories of Trump 2.0. While he supports the MAGA movement, the Trump-led government supports him. Recent examples include the president touting Musk’s Tesla vehicles on the White House lawn, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urging people to buy Tesla stock and Attorney General Pam Bondi prioritizing prosecutions of people who allegedly harm Tesla property.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s vengeance against disfavored law firms featured a capitulation this week. After a judge blocked the president’s order targeting the Perkins Coie firm last week, it looked like Trump’s similar order against another big firm, Paul Weiss, would meet the same fate in court. The president had targeted the latter firm for its association with Mark Pomerantz, who investigated Trump in what became his only criminal case that went to trial before the election, ending in guilty verdicts on 34 counts of falsifying business records. (The president is appealing.)\n\nBut rather than challenge the order in court, where the odds of success would have been high given Perkins Coie’s success, Paul Weiss made a deal. However little the White House gained on paper from the agreement, the mere fact of the settlement sets a precedent that the president’s overtly retaliatory actions are something to be managed rather than challenged.\n\nAt the Supreme Court, Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch was the lone GOP appointee to dissent from the court’s 5-4 refusal to halt the execution of Jessie Hoffman on Tuesday. The Buddhist death row prisoner had argued that Louisiana’s nitrogen gas execution method would violate his religious rights because, he said, it would interfere with his meditative breathing as he died. Gorsuch said he would’ve blocked the execution to let Hoffman pursue his claim.\n\nIt wasn’t Gorsuch’s only notable split from colleagues in a criminal case. On Friday, he dissented from Justice Clarence Thomas’ majority ruling about what technically counts as a violent crime. The Trump appointee was joined by Biden appointee Ketanji Brown Jackson, a pairing that might sound unusual at first glance but is far from unprecedented.\n\nHeading into the home stretch of the high court term, the March argument session starts Monday with a hearing over racial gerrymandering in Louisiana. The court’s regularly scheduled hearings wrap up in April, and the justices usually issue the final opinions by July. On top of those pending cases — with rulings still due on ghost guns, transgender rights and more — Trump’s executive actions could add further emergency litigation for the justices to decide. More on that subject in this week’s “Ask Jordan” feature.\n\nHave any questions or comments for me? I’d love to hear from you!

        "title": "The biggest (and most avoidable) mistake in Trump’s release of the JFK assassination files",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump took a moment at an Oval Office event to brag about his decision to release thousands of documents related to John F. Kennedy’s assassination, which he characterized as a great breakthrough. Unprompted, however, the president brought up a serious point of contention.\n\n“We even released Social Security numbers; I didn’t want anything deleted,” he told reporters. “They said, ‘Sir, what about Social Security numbers?’ ... But they’re long gone. I can’t imagine.”\n\nEvidently, the president isn’t keeping up on current events. The New York Times reported:\n\nThe Trump administration scrambled to minimize fallout on Thursday after exposing personal information, including Social Security numbers, of hundreds of congressional staff members, intelligence researchers and even an ambassador when releasing files pertaining to the death of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nI realize the Trump White House has faced important questions about its competence, but it would’ve been easy to avoid this humiliation.\n\nOn Monday, the president directed the National Archives to disclose 64,000 pages of documents related to Kennedy’s 1963 assassination. On Tuesday, the materials were released to the public — unredacted.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House decided it’d probably be a good idea to check to see if officials, following Trump’s explicit order, had just exposed the Social Security numbers of living people. And on Thursday, the Republican team acknowledged that there was a problem.\n\nThe president might be under the impression that the relevant people are “long gone,” but that’s not even close to being true: In fact, Joe diGenova — Trump’s own former campaign lawyer — was one of the people whose Social Security number was released to the public.\n\nWhat’s more, the problem isn’t limited to Social Security numbers: Birthdates, birthplaces and other private information — related to living people — was also released as part of the same exercise.\n\nIf you’re wondering whether all of this suggests that the White House violated federal private laws in the course of this debacle, plenty of experts suggested that the answer is yes. There might even be litigation as a result of Trump’s screw-up.\n\nThe Washington Post reported, “Many whose Social Security numbers were exposed had become high-ranking officials in Washington. They include a former assistant secretary of state, a former U.S. ambassador, researchers in the intelligence world, State Department workers and prominent lawyers.”\n\nIn the hopes of putting things right, the White House directed the Social Security Administration to issue new numbers to the affected people, as well as offering free credit monitoring.\n\nBecause if there’s one thing people in their 80s and 90s want to deal with, it’s to start over with new Social Security numbers and incorporate those into their financial lives.\n\nThe New York Times’ report added administration officials “knew before the documents went out that releasing them without redactions would expose some personal information,” and while that might seem outrageous, Trump confirmed this morning that when he was confronted with this warning, he chose to ignore it because he assumed all of the relevant people would be dead.\n\nMany of the relevant people are, however, alive and well — but suddenly worried about being doxxed.\n\nIt’s possible at this point that some readers might be thinking to themselves, “This might be awful for those affected by the White House’s latest fiasco, and I’m relieved that I’m not involved.” And while that would be an understandable reaction, let’s not forget that Team Trump isn’t exactly going out of its way to protect everyone else’s private Social Security information, either. The Washington Post also reported:\n\nA federal judge on Thursday barred U.S. DOGE Service employees from accessing sensitive Social Security Administration data and ordered members of the team led by Elon Musk to delete any personally identifiable information it has obtained from the agency. On the broad premise of rooting out fraud within the federal government, about a dozen Musk-aligned tech engineers gained access to databases containing reams of taxpayer information.\n\n“To facilitate this expedition, SSA provided members of the SSA DOGE Team with unbridled access to the personal and private data of millions of Americans,” U.S. District Court Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander wrote. That included access to “Social Security numbers, medical records, mental health records, hospitalization records, drivers’ license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income history, work history, birth and marriage certificates, and home and work addresses.”\n\nIn the process, the judge added, the Trump administration exposed “personal, confidential, sensitive, and private information that millions of Americans entrusted to their government.”\n\nI have a hunch we haven’t heard the last of this story.",

        "title": "Trump’s FCC leader threatens to kill mergers over DEI policies",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s handpicked appointee sitting atop the Federal Communications Commission declared Friday that his agency is prepared to block mergers and attempted acquisitions involving companies that promote what he called “invidious” diversity policies.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr openly said: “Any businesses that are looking for FCC approval, I would encourage them to get busy ending any sort of their invidious forms of DEI discrimination.” The outlet also quoted him as saying: “If there’s businesses out there that are still promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination, I really don’t see a path forward where the FCC could reach the conclusion that approving the transaction is going to be in the public interest.”\n\nAccording to the report, Carr specifically mentioned Paramount Global’s merger with Skydance Media as well as Verizon Communications Inc.’s acquisition of Frontier Communications Parent Inc. as deals that are potentially in doubt as a result.\n\nIn reality, DEI programs help foster work environments that studies have shown are more productive than ones where diversity, equity and inclusion aren’t emphasized. But the MAGA movement has falsely portrayed these programs, which vary and have been known to benefit all kinds of races, genders, religions and socioeconomic classes, as discriminatory toward white men.\n\nIn Carr’s threat, we see the Trump administration flexing its authoritarian powers in an attempt to subjugate American media outlets in ways that Hungary’s illiberal leader, Viktor Orbán, advised Republicans to do back in 2022. And it’s entirely possible that media companies bow to the White House on this and dismantle their diversity programs, given how other companies have already caved on this front.\n\nA discussion of whether a media merger is allowed might seem a little irrelevant to people who don’t work in the field. But the diversity of the people who work for American media companies, which are responsible for distributing information and entertainment to the masses, can have a large impact on broader society.\n\nIn recent years, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, has promoted two Government Accountability Office reports that use data to make the argument that a lack of Latino representation in media has helped fuel bigoted stereotypes about the Latino community. And we’ve seen how stereotypes in media and television can afflict people of other races and religions, including Black people and Muslims, as well.\n\nIf Trump’s administration can get media companies — many of which have fallen woefully short in fostering diverse workplaces — to renounce the efforts they already have put forth to improve, we could see a media environment more hostile to racial, gender and LGBTQ-related inclusivity than any in recent memory.\n\nI’ll also note, in closing, that MSNBC could be in the administration’s crosshairs as well. The network is in the process of being spun off from its parent company, Comcast, and Trump has frequently fumed at MSNBC. Last week, he falsely called critical coverage of him on the network “illegal,” and on Friday in the Oval Office, he said he thought CNN and MSNBC are “going to be turned off,” a claim he attributed to ratings but which seemed to blur the line between an aspiration and a thinly veiled order.",

        "content": "At least three people were killed and 15 others injured in a shooting in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on Friday night, police said.\n\nTwo 19-year-old men and a 16-year-old boy were killed, the Las Cruces Police Department said in a news release on Saturday. Those wounded in the shooting range from 16 to 36 years old.\n\nThe shooting occurred at around 10 p.m. in the parking lot of Young Park, police said. Las Cruces Police Chief Jeremy Story said at a news conference Saturday that the shooting resulted from a fight between two groups at an unsanctioned car show that “escalated to gunfire.”\n\n“We know that there is some type of of ill will between these groups prior to last night, so they had some issues before and it escalated last night,” he said.\n\nSeveral people were caught in the crossfire, according to the police chief. No arrests have been made, but police said they are pursuing several leads. Authorities are asking witnesses to come forward with any information and to submit any videos or photos of the shooting.\n\n“This is a huge crime scene with a lot of moving parts,” Story said.\n\nSeven of the injured were taken from local hospitals to El Paso for further treatment, Las Cruces Fire Chief Michael Daniels told reporters. Four others have been treated and released. Authorities said they were awaiting a status update on the rest of the injured patients.\n\nMore than one firearm was used in the shooting, Story said, adding that they had found dozens of handgun-caliber casings in the parking lot and throughout the park.\n\nLas Cruces city council member and Mayor Pro Tem Johana Bencomo called the shooting “a heinous act of violence” in a post on Instagram on Saturday morning. “Part of me wanted to write that this is something you never really think this is going to happen in your city, but that actually feels deeply untrue,” Bencomo wrote. “Honestly now days a tragedy like this feels like a nightmare just waiting to come true at any possible moment.”",

        "title": "The new 'Hunger Games' book 'Sunrise on the Reaping' is perfect for the Trump era",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this week, Suzanne Collins added another book to her literary pantheon, a prequel to “The Hunger Games” called “Sunrise on the Reaping.” Nearly two decades after the original trilogy was published, “Sunrise on the Reaping” proves how critical and timely the series remains.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” reads like it is aware of its impact and its audience. Collins’ writing is as lyrical and engrossing as it was when “The Hunger Games” debuted 17 years ago; the difference is this new book is born into an already existing cultural dominion. Collins has always had something to say, but in the context of President Donald Trump’s America, one closer to the world of “The Hunger Games” than ever before, her message is salient.\n\nCollins has always had something to say, but in the context of President Donald Trump’s America, one closer to the world of “The Hunger Games” than ever before, her message is salient.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” centers on Haymitch Abernathy, a complex and misunderstood alcoholic who appears in the original trilogy as Katniss Everdeen’s initially begrudging and then devoted coach and mentor. Collins capitalizes on the familiarity most readers will have with Haymitch’s character to craft a story that deftly examines the power of propaganda and the early stages of authoritarian rule.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” is Collins’ second prequel. The first, “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,” chronicles President Coriolanus Snow’s journey to becoming the fascist leader of Panem, Collins’ dystopian reimagining of North America. Read together, the two novels illustrate how fascism takes shape: You need the right person and the right environment.\n\nThere are certain elements, structurally and stylistically, that all five books share. Collins breaks her novels into three equal parts, with the same number of chapters. In a rare interview this week with Scholastic’s David Levithan, Collins explained, “I began as a playwright over forty years ago, and that dramatic structure became the template for the novels. … I know certain things I want to achieve by certain points in the story. If I haven’t achieved them, something isn’t working the way I hoped, and I probably need to pause and figure out why.”\n\nStylistically, “The Hunger Games” series makes its reader culpable in the grotesque deaths of tributes, of children. Collins masterfully writes these scenes to be fast-paced, engrossing and detailed. You like reading them. You enjoy the horrifying brutality of the Hunger Games. In this way, the reader is complicit — just as complicit as the series’ wealthy citizens of The Capitol, who watch from safe perches in colorful outfits. Collins also grounds the novel with numerous literary references: Haymitch remembers a William Blake poem, Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” is repeated again and again, we have a character named for Emperor Caligula’s horse, and the book opens with four quotes including a reflection from George Orwell.\n\nCollins has a knack for eliciting emotion. Readers across the country posted photos of their tear-streaked faces and puffy eyes on social media after finishing “Sunrise on the Reaping.”\n\nIn 17 years, Collins has created a brutal, grisly and heart-wrenching world that has gripped a generation of readers. Like Margaret Atwood and George Orwell before her, Collins’ novels have become part of the lexicon, an adjective — this is very Hunger Games — used to illustrate government overreach and authoritarianism. “The Hunger Games” series, including “Sunrise on the Reaping,” is a central part in the American dystopian literary canon. Dystopian literature doesn’t look like any one overarching government, environmental catastrophe or mechanism for control. What it all shares is a worst-case-scenario examination that is thought-provoking and engrossing, especially for young readers.\n\nLike Margaret Atwood and George Orwell before her, Collins’ novels have become part of the lexicon.\n\nYoung adult dystopian novels are hugely popular. The runaway success of “The Hunger Games,” with a megahit movie franchise and more than 100 million copies in print, proves that. At a recent meeting of MSNBC’s the Velshi Banned Book Club, Lois Lowry, author of one of the first young adult dystopian novels to captivate the nation, “The Giver,” attributes the success of the genre — and its widespread bans and removals — to the young protagonists. In the pages of these books, it is the young hero, the underdog, who enacts societal change. “A young person has perceived the hypocrisy and corruption of the governance of the generation that has created their world,” Lowry said.\n\nThe propaganda commentary at the center of “Sunrise on the Reaping” reminded me of early August when Elon Musk reposted a popular meme that regularly circulates online: “You watched ‘The Hunger Games’ and sided with the resistance. … When it’s fiction you understand. Yet you refuse to see it when it’s the reality you’re living in. Wild.” Seventy-four million people viewed the post. Many of them reacted negatively, calling Musk, and his wealth and influence, The Capitol. This isn’t the only time men of undue and dangerous influence have twisted Collins’ story in and attempt to use it for their own benefit. If nothing else, it proves the power of literature, particularly this genre of literature, to influence and inspire. In the brutal world of Panem, the narrative must be controlled. And off the page? The narrative must be distorted.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In a Fox News interview that aired on Wednesday, Donald Trump admitted that he worries his plan to invent and distribute so-called golden visas to people willing to pay a $5 million fee could cause \"unsavory people\" to come to the United States.\n\nWhile he's argued that the \"gold visa\" proposal would spur investment in the U.S., Trump acknowledged on Fox News that there may be downsides, though he promised to kick out any immigrants if he learns of wrongdoing.\n\nIn the interview, Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked Trump if he's \"worried about any unsavory people coming in.\"\n\n“Yeah, I’m worried about unsavory — in which case we’re gonna give ‘em the money back and they get out,” Trump replied. He also said, when pressed, that the visa holders would be \"properly vetted\" but seemingly started to add a caveat. \"You know, when you're talking about a lot of people — I think it's gonna be very successful.\"\n\nTrump has proposed the gold visas as a juiced-up replacement of the EB-5 visa, which already exists to allow foreign investors to obtain a green card if they invest at least $1.05 million in the U.S. Other countries with similar \"golden passports\" include Austria, Egypt and Turkey.\n\nThe proposal came even as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, targeted legal immigrants for deportation and contracted with El Salvador to send some deportees to a notorious prison complex.\n\nIn the interview, Ingraham also asked Trump why U.S. citizenship should be on sale \"for any amount of money\" and how it fit with his \"America First\" philosophy. Trump responded that he proposed the idea because he’s “America First,” claiming without evidence that the policy might even bring as many as 1 million new immigrants.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for MSNBC, Rotimi Adeoye laid out the moral and ethical objections to the proposal:\n\nIn Trump’s vision, citizenship is no longer about building a shared national project; it is an asset reserved for those who can afford it, as it is in countries with “golden visa” programs such as Malta and Cyprus. Being American would become a high-end commodity, available only to the wealthy.\n\nCritics have been outspoken in laying out their worries about this golden visa plan. But the Fox News interview shows that even Trump is concerned that the new visas could be abused and he has no real plan to stop that.",

        "title": "The nostalgia of mourning Forever 21's store closures",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The year is 2009. You’re a sophomore at a big public high school in northern New Jersey. The seasons are just starting to change, you’ve got babysitting money in your black Longchamp tote, your favorite berry-pink North Face fleece jacket on, and there is a school dance with a DJ on Friday night. It’s “neon safari” themed. You pile into your friend’s navy-blue Jeep Commander — she’s borrowing it from her father — and you head down Route 17 to the Garden State Plaza mall. There is only one place to get the perfect outfit for the school dance: the fast-fashion mecca of Forever 21.\n\nIn 2025, things are a bit different. The nation’s first mainstream embrace of fast fashion, Forever 21, is expected to close some 350 U.S. stores by May 1. The embattled brand has filed for bankruptcy twice in the past six years, blaming falling sales on competition from Chinese megabrands like Shein and Temu and their staggering online inventories. According to CNBC, at its peak Forever 21 employed 43,000 people and generated more than $4 billion in annual sales.\n\nI’m morally opposed to fast fashion from an environmental, human rights and consumerism standpoint. And yet, I am nostalgic.\n\nI shouldn’t feel a thing about Forever 21 shutting its sliding glass doors for good. My shopping habits have entirely changed in the last 15 years, favoring fewer, often vintage, higher-quality items over the abundance of low-quality, cheap and trendy wares the retailer has sold for decades. I’m morally opposed to fast fashion from an environmental, human rights and consumerism standpoint. And yet, I am nostalgic. Forever 21, for its woefully disorganized racks, its inconsistent sizing and notoriously shoddy quality, represents a bygone era, a hopeful era. It wasn’t just that I was a teen with a little bit of money, an outfit in mind and a friend with a license. The nation felt like it was coming out of darkness, toward a new light. There’s a reason Gen Z is romanticizing that era: So much felt possible.Although the pejorative “fast fashion” was coined by The New York Times in 1990, it didn’t truly enter the lexicon until the proliferation of Zara some years later. I’m sure many people were critically examining just how Forever 21’s clothes could be so inexpensive, but it certainly wasn’t the retailer’s very young target demographic. Forever 21 burst onto the scene like an apparition out of the 2008 financial crisis. There was a freedom and an independence in the low prices; a parent lamenting that the clothing looked cheap and was poor quality, but which you bought on your own, was nearly a rite of passage. In hindsight, though, Forever 21 was a primer, normalizing the concept of fast fashion for very young shoppers. The expectation became on-trend pieces for very low prices all the time, everywhere. It was well understood that you might get a handful of wears out of a Forever 21 item if you were lucky. Generally, you bought a metallic bodycon skirt or a pair of jeggings with the intention of wearing them once or twice. If your new tank top disintegrated after a single wash, well, that was the price you paid.\n\nForever 21’s organizational system, which at the time seemed bizarre and illogical to me, paved the way for the aesthetics we see dominating social media and the fashion space today. The clothes we’re not grouped by item, but by trend. In 2009, for example, there would have been an entire corner brimming with fluorescent tank tops, skirts and bandage dresses perfect for the neon-themed school dance. TikTok often categorizes users’ style as a specific aesthetic in a similar way: mob wife, clean girl, balletcore. I’ve written before about how damaging the accelerated fast-fashion trend cycle is to personal style, the fashion world and the environment. And Forever 21 was at the forefront. It was there that trends were first capitalized upon and then churned out again and again, quicker and quicker. Sure, you could try on and shed different styles with no material financial risk, but with only a few looks to choose from, your creativity was already impeded. Your self-expression was limited to what was on the rolling racks spread across Forever 21’s white, high-shine floor.Forever 21 is in a hell of its own making. By creating such a rapid trend cycle, insatiable demand and low price expectations, Forever 21 simply could not keep up with the consumer habits it founded. Shein and Temu — reportedly perpetrating human rights violations against their round-the-clock factory workers and emitting millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution — simply can, for now at least.\n\nThe last time I stepped foot in a Forever 21 was 2016. I had a friend visiting me in my first New York City apartment and we needed ugly sweaters for a Christmas party. I remember being surprised at the state of the store. It wasn’t that it was kitschier, or quiet, or aimed at younger shoppers. It felt like stepping into a broken time capsule, uncanny and unsettling — even then, a time gone by.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost a year since the women’s NCAA Tournament national championship game eclipsed the men’s national championship game for the first time in viewership, ticket sales and hype. With the 2025 women’s tournament officially starting Friday, what have we learned about the world of women’s college basketball since Iowa’s Caitlin Clark and her LSU rival, Angel Reese, left for the WNBA?\n\nSimply put, the idea that women’s college basketball couldn’t reach high levels of success without Clark was false.\n\nThe idea that women’s college basketball couldn’t reach high levels of success without Clark was false.\n\nTo be clear, there’s a lot of doubt among television executives regarding whether this year’s women’s national championship game will reach the 19 million viewers that last year’s showdown between Clark’s Iowa Hawkeyes and Kamilla Cardoso’s South Carolina Gamecocks got. It’s worth examining how the sport has done on major television networks following the departures of Clark, Reese and many of the other college players who transitioned to the pros.\n\nFor years, a catch-22 of women’s basketball has been the complaint from major networks like Fox, ABC and CBS that women’s sports doesn’t have a large enough fan base and the counter from fans that the fan base won’t grow if games aren’t televised. For so long, networks generally declined to show women’s college basketball on the most accessible television networks.\n\nHowever, as a result of the success last season, Fox, CBS and the Disney family of networks (ABC and ESPN) all broadcast more this women’s college basketball season. Fox broadcast 18 games during the 2024-25 season, including five games in prime-time Saturday night slots.\n\n“There are great stars, great brands. We’ve done more than we have done before, and we’re not alone in doing that,” Fox Sports’ president of insights and analytics, Mike Mulvihill, said.\n\nCBS broadcast this season’s Big Ten Tournament final for the second straight year. It included the third matchup of the season between Los Angeles rivals UCLA and USC, who have two superstar talents of their own. The Clark-vs.-Reese rivalry was only the beginning. I’ll come back to this.\n\nFox, CBS and the Disney family of networks (ABC and ESPN) all broadcast more this women’s college basketball season.\n\nThe Big Ten championship game drew 1.44 million viewers, and UConn vs. USC averaged 2.2 million viewers on a Fox Saturday night prime-time matchup. While there was a dip when it came to how Clark’s games did on these same networks a year before, these non-Clark games still got viewerships in the millions. That’s not nothing, and the numbers prove that viewers are drawn to other stars, too.\n\nAnd then there are ABC and ESPN. Their regular-season ratings were up 3% over last year and up 41% from the 2022-23 season. This was the most-watched women’s college basketball regular season since the season Tina Charles and Maya Moore led UConn to the national championship in 2009. There was a 120% year-over-year viewership increase in the three games televised on ABC, which averaged 1.3 million viewers a game.\n\nViewership of around 1 million people across multiple networks disproves the prediction that the women’s college game wouldn’t stay afloat after Clark and Reese left. Another sign the game is doing just fine: The average price for a 30-second commercial during this year’s women’s national championship game has more than doubled.\n\nA big reason an equal number of people, if not more, have watched women’s college basketball the season after Clark, Reese and Cardoso left is the wide array of talent teams have put on the court all season. According to ESPN Bet, there are six teams with better than 10-to-1 odds to win the national championship. Parity has been the name of the game this season.\n\nEach of those six teams has at least one generational talent who’s bound to have a successful WNBA career. Let’s begin with USC’s JuJu Watkins, a 6-2 two-way small forward who is a prolific scorer and gifted athlete. Watkins has played the tournament’s No. 1 overall seed, UCLA, and point center Lauren Betts three times and beaten them twice.\n\nBut both L.A. schools are on the same side of the bracket as UConn, which has Paige Bueckers, the 2021 National Player of the Year, who is playing in her final NCAA Tournament. With shooting guard Azzi Fudd and big wing Sarah Strong, Bueckers has more talent around her than she’s had in her entire UConn career.\n\nReese, Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Chelsea Gray made sure Unrivaled was a year-one success.\n\nWe can’t forget about Notre Dame, which has a three-headed monster in its backcourt: flashy pass-first guard Olivia Miles, defense-minded slashing guard Hannah Hidalgo and do-it-all wing Sonia Citron. But to win the championship, the Fighting Irish will have to get through Texas, led by three-level scoring point forward Madison Booker, and the defending champions, the South Carolina Gamecocks, who are arguably the deepest team in the field.\n\nThe Gamecocks don’t have a true No. 1 option, but March Madness is when superstars are born. Does speedy and shifty guard MiLaysia Fulwiley emerge as South Carolina’s unstoppable force? We’ll have to see.\n\nPeople don’t have to know that Clark is playing to watch women play basketball. The new 3-on-3 professional league Unrivaled aggressively pursued her to play in its inaugural season. She decided against it. Still, 364,000 viewers (the second most who’d ever watched an Unrivaled game), watched the first-ever championship game. Other WNBA stars, including Reese, Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Chelsea Gray made sure Unrivaled was a year-one success.\n\nIn the same way, Watkins, Bueckers, Hidalgo, Miles, Booker and Fulwiley will keep March Madness humming following the departure of Clark. The women’s basketball boom was never about one player, and now we have the numbers that prove it.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Trump v. the lawyers\n\nPresident Donald Trump has escalated his attacks on the legal system to include lawyers who’ve dared to represent the other side in his legal cases, undermining a fundamental principle of the rule of law.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump signed two disturbing executive orders targeting white-shoe law firms. On Friday he announced he was rescinding one of them when the firm, Paul Weiss, agreed to provide $40 million worth of pro bono legal services to support specific White House initiatives.\n\nThe message was clear: Work for Trump’s opponents, and you’ll be punished; work for him, and you’ll be rewarded.\n\nAnd the punishment was severe. The executive orders targeting Perkins Coie and Paul Weiss stripped their lawyers of security clearances needed to work on sensitive cases, cut the firms off from all government contracts and, in some cases, even barred their attorneys from entering federal buildings. That would make it impossible for them to work for certain clients — as one already did, citing the order.\n\nTrump claimed he was enacting these sanctions because of “national security risks” and the firms’ alleged “racial bias” in hiring due to “DEI,” which are two of his favorite fabricated attack lines. But the executive orders undermined that argument when they began by rehashing old Trump complaints about the firms' political work.\n\nThe Perkins Coie order started by criticizing the firm for its work in 2016 for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, which included taking over research that became the Steele dossier, a document that contained allegations of collusion between Trump’s campaign and the Russian government. (In the order, the Trump administration claimed that the dossier was “designed to steal an election.”)\n\nThe Paul Weiss order, meanwhile, began by criticizing a partner who worked for special counsel Robert Mueller and on a case against Jan. 6 participants, and a former partner who worked on Trump’s “hush money” case in Manhattan, which resulted in his conviction on 34 felony counts. (In the order, the Trump administration claimed that \"global law firms\" played a role in \"undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles.\")\n\nWhile a lower court judge blocked the Perkins Coie order temporarily, saying it sent “chills down [her] spine,” Trump’s intimidation campaign appears to be working. Behind closed doors, some of the country’s most influential law firms are debating whether to push back publicly. Many, however, are too scared of retribution, according to five lawyers granted anonymity by Politico to speak candidly.\n\nAnd it’s not just lawyers. Judges overseeing cases tied to his agenda are receiving death threats. After Trump called for the impeachment of a federal judge who ruled against him, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare public rebuke, writing that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.” So the point is this: Trump’s threat to our judicial system goes far beyond him possibly ignoring a federal court ruling.\n\nAs the country’s first president to be tried and convicted of crimes, Trump has always had a troubled relationship with the courts. But his new strategy isn’t just about trying to win in court. It’s about terrifying the legal profession into submission. Because if he can scare the nation’s best lawyers away from taking cases opposing his interests, he can win before anyone even sets foot in a courtroom.\n\nA story you should be following: Trump’s USDA just cut $1 billion from schools and food banks\n\nFood banks across the country are already struggling to meet demand. The Trump administration has decided now is the perfect time to slash more than $1 billion in funding that helps schools and food banks purchase fresh food from local farmers.\n\nThe cuts eliminated $660 million that schools rely on to buy local produce, meat and dairy and $420 million that helped food banks stock their shelves. The U.S. Department of Agriculture claims it’s shifting toward “fiscally responsible initiatives,” but for millions of kids and families, that means less access to fresh, healthy food — and for farmers, it means losing a critical source of income.\n\nThe effects are already being felt:\n\nScottsdale Unified School District in Arizona just lost $100,000 it had planned to spend on local beef and fresh fruits and vegetables for school lunches.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey says her state will lose $12 million in school meal funding, forcing districts to scramble to cover the shortfall.\n\nIn North Carolina, some farmers grow exclusively for food banks. As one put it, “This program is what has been keeping our family farm open.”\n\nThe consequences are clear: fewer healthy meals for kids, more struggling families turning to food banks, and small farms pushed closer to closure. Once again, much like Trump’s cuts to USAID food purchase programs, small farmers are paying the price.\n\nSomeone you should know: Idaho sixth grade history teacher Sarah Inama\n\nYou’d think a sign that says “Everyone is welcome here” wouldn’t be controversial. But in one Idaho school district, that message was deemed too political, and now a teacher is facing possible termination for refusing to take it down.\n\nSarah Inama, a sixth grade history teacher, says she put up the sign five years ago to help students know they were learning in an “open and welcoming space.” But her principal recently told her to take it down, citing a district policy that requires classrooms to “respect the rights of people to express differing opinions” and that decorations must be “content-neutral.”\n\nAn Idaho school district ordered a teacher to remove an “Everyone is welcome here” sign. Courtesy Sarah Inama\n\nConfused about how this picture is controversial? Us, too.\n\nAs Inama responded, “There are only two opinions on this sign: Everyone is welcome here, or not everyone is welcome here.” And if welcoming everyone is too controversial, that tells you exactly where we are right now.\n\nAt a time when Trump and his allies are attacking basic rights — from the courts to the classroom — it’s not easy to stand up to this pressure. But across the country, people like Inama are refusing to back down. And we should all be paying attention.",

Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger; and attorneys Mark Zaid and Norman Eisen.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, both of whom pursued criminal cases against Trump, were also on the list.\n\nAs NBC News pointed out, many of those named in Trump’s memo had already seen their clearances revoked by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard earlier this month.\n\nIn January, Trump rescinded the security clearances of 50 former intelligence officials, including his former national security adviser John Bolton. Legal experts said at the time that it amounted to an attempt to intimidate and silence those who have crossed him.\n\nTrump has more recently used the threat of pulling security clearances to bend top law firms to his will. At least one firm, Paul Weiss, gave in to that effort Thursday, eliminating its diversity policies and agreeing to provide $40 million in pro bono work for causes Trump supports in exchange for the reversal of an executive order that targeted the company.\n\nThe president has also removed security details for some of his political targets, some of whom continue to face legitimate security threats. Earlier this week, he announced he was stripping Biden’s children, Hunter and Ashley Biden, of Secret Service protection.",

        "content": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is under siege — by his own party.\n\nAfter the New York Democrat capitulated to President Donald Trump over a short-term funding bill, he’s received some pointed warnings from colleagues warning that his leadership position could be in jeopardy. An increasing number of liberal organizations are calling on Schumer to either step down from his leadership position or to fight more aggressively. Schumer even canceled events promoting his new book this week after progressive groups planned to stage protests against them.\n\nThe dissent reflects the Democratic Party’s intensifying identity crisis over how to fight back against Trump.\n\nThe dissent reflects the Democratic Party’s intensifying identity crisis over how to fight back against Trump — and a rejection of Schumer’s belief that Trump’s policy mistakes will speak for themselves. Should Schumer continue to invest in the “play dead” strategy, it could cost him his position.\n\nRep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., was the first to openly call for Schumer to step down at a town hall on Tuesday. “I respect Chuck Schumer. I think he had a great, long-standing career, did a lot of great things, but I’m afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to get a new leader,” he said. That same day, Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., responded affirmatively when asked at a town hall if she supported him stepping down. When asked if more could follow, one House Democrat told Axios, “I think there are some already there but just haven’t been asked directly or avoided the question.”\n\nSchumer’s colleagues in the Senate haven’t called on him to step down, but they’ve still been strikingly critical. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Schumer was “wrong” to cooperate with Trump. When asked at a town hall if he would call for Schumer to step down, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said: “In dodging your question, let me just say: It’s important for people to know when it’s time to go, and I think in the case of Joe Biden. And we’re going to have conversations I’m sure in the foreseeable future about all the Democratic leadership.”\n\nBennet’s invocation of Biden’s implosion should make Schumer at least a little uneasy. We’re certainly not close to the rolling wave of demands for Biden to step down from his presidential candidacy in 2024. But an idea has to start somewhere, and now it’s in the air.\n\nRecall that when the calls for Biden’s withdrawal started to pick up, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi effectively let them take their course by refusing to stand in the way and saying it was up to Biden to decide whether he wanted to remain in the race. Pelosi may be positioning herself analogously in this moment. She hasn’t come out against Schumer’s leadership position, but she also criticized him sharply this week, telling reporters that Schumer could have negotiated harder with Republicans by pushing back against spending cuts to programs like Medicaid and trying to get them to “agree to a third way.” Failing that, she argued, Democrats should have at least attempted to set Republicans up for the blame in case of a government shutdown. “I myself don’t give away anything for nothing,” she said. “I think that’s what happened the other day.”\n\nSchumer has led his party in the Senate for the better part of a decade, and he can probably withstand a lot of heat. But the pressure is on for him to change his approach to legislative fights in the coming months, including bills to raise the debt ceiling, and another government funding bill in the fall. Ultimately his leadership position is less important than what the threats to it symbolize: a desperate feeling that the party needs an overhaul.",

        "title": "Trump's Kennedy Center fantasies are chasing away its primary audiences",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Don’t cry for him, America, but when it comes to his vision for the Kennedy Center, President Donald J. Trump appears to be dreaming impossible dreams.\n\nThe president, who is also now the board chair for the Kennedy Center, convened a meeting of said board on Monday. In a recording of the meeting shared with The Washington Post, Trump and members said they’d like to see “Camelot,” “Cats,” “Fiddler on the Roof,” “Hello, Dolly!” and “The Phantom of the Opera” featured at the Kennedy Center. Speaking with reporters, Trump said, “We’re going to get some very good shows.”\n\nMost Kennedy Center audiences were never the sort of conservative theatergoers clamoring for a season of ‘Cats,’ ‘Phantom’ and ‘Fiddler on the Roof.’\n\nThere are a number of practical problems with this wish list, the first of which is that none of those musicals are touring in North America (although a tour of “Phantom” does launch in November). And if the Kennedy Center were to try to mount its own nonunion productions, it would run into a brick wall of standing labor contracts.\n\n“We’re gonna fix that,” the president said upon learning that the Kennedy Center would have had to pay the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees in order to have board member Lee Greenwood sing at the meeting. “They wanted $30,000 to move a piano,” Trump claimed.\n\nAnd yet, none of these obstacles prevent the president of the United States from assuming “Cats” will be onstage at the Kennedy Center next year, as if he has the power to summon Mr. Mistoffelees and Rum Tum Tugger through sheer will.\n\nSince Feb. 7, when Trump announced plans to appoint himself America’s arts impresario in chief, he has fired roughly two dozen board members appointed by President Joe Biden, had the remaining trustees elect a new president of the board and dismissed Kennedy Center leader Deborah Rutter, who had helmed the institution for 11 years.\n\nLife at the center has been a tumultuous free fall ever since, with a series of cancellations and missed deadlines. The second week of March, when the Kennedy Center typically announces programming for the next season, has come and gone. Across Washington, venues like The Anthem and Shakespeare Theatre Company are fielding calls from artists and organizations looking for somewhere else to perform. Most notably, the producers and creators of the musical theater juggernaut “Hamilton” announced they were canceling a two-month run, which most likely have generated more money than any other show in the 2025-26 Kennedy Center season.\n\n“I never liked ‘Hamilton’ very much,” the president said, undeterred.\n\nYet alleged financial mismanagement at the Kennedy Center has been top of mind for Trump and his surrogates, including Ric Grenell, the former ambassador whom the president appointed to replace Rutter on at least an interim basis, who accused the center of having low cash reserves.\n\nAs a nonprofit organization, the Kennedy Center is required to submit public tax returns, and the most recently available filings indicate it is not in financial distress, with a total budget of $268 million and a surplus of $6 million. About 16% percent of the budget comes from a congressional appropriation specifically earmarked for physical upkeep, because the center was dedicated in 1971 as a national memorial to slain President John F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nStaffers have admitted that some needed maintenance has been deferred, and regular visitors know that massive columns on the weather-beaten Potomac River side are under scaffolding for repairs. Still, the center hardly seems in need of the make-it-great-again overhaul the president claims. “It’s in tremendous disrepair, as is a lot of our country,” Trump said. His redecorating plans include “the seats, the décor, everything” and will be funded by Congress.\n\nBut in a series of recent interviews, a board member appointed during Trump’s first term has shared his own glitzed-up vision for the Kennedy Center. Among other things, New York real estate magnate Paolo Zampolli has proposed fashion shows, a Cipriani restaurant and a ramp so he can travel by boat from Georgetown instead of taking an Uber.\n\n“I see the center like La Scala of Milano,” he told Politico. “So luxurious. So prestigious.”\n\nThe center hardly seems in need of the make-it-great-again overhaul the president claims.\n\nBut Zampolli’s vision of the Kennedy Center as a hangout for Washington’s 1% sets up an odd dichotomy for the proposed audience. The average red-hat-wearing tourist who might buy tickets for “Cats” has never dreamed of eating overpriced spaghetti at Cipriani. The reality is that most Kennedy Center audiences are in the middle of these two demographics: They are federal workers who enjoy classical music, NGO lobbyists with undergraduate theater degrees and labor leaders with affinities for modern dance. And they are exactly the people now weighing whether to boycott Kennedy Center performances, because they are laid off, they are protesting Trump’s takeover or both.\n\nMore important, most Kennedy Center audiences were never the sort of conservative theatergoers clamoring for a season of “Cats,” “Phantom” and “Fiddler on the Roof.”\n\n“Those are G-rated, general audience, high school-approved shows,” Lulu Picart told me. A Broadway performer and theater artist, Picart appeared at the Kennedy Center in the 2023 touring production of the musical “1776,” which featured a cast of female, trans and nonbinary performers as America’s Founding Fathers.\n\nPicart and her cast members were appalled to wake up one February morning and discover all record of the groundbreaking performance had been scrubbed from the Kennedy Center’s website. (Ironically, the Trump administration has made artistic endeavors celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence a priority over at the National Endowment for the Arts.)\n\nThe president, in an Evita-like photo-op on Monday, stood in the Kennedy Center’s Opera House presidential box, arms outstretched as if there were hundreds of fans below him instead of a handful of handpicked board members.\n\n“It won’t be easy, you’ll think it strange,” the eponymous character Evita sang in the opening of her anthem for a new Argentina. She’s absolutely right. The changes Trump is proposing won’t be easy. And as anyone who knows show business could tell the president, it’s also very, very strange.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump promoted Elon Musk’s Tesla vehicles on the White House lawn. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urged Fox News viewers to buy stock in the electric car company. And we’re seeing this whole-of-government effort backing the world’s richest person (and Trump’s top 2024 election donor) extend to the Department of Justice as well.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi most recently emphasized her support of Musk on Thursday, when she issued a press release headlined, “Attorney General Pamela Bondi Announces Severe Charges Against Violent Tesla Arsonists.” The release didn’t name specific defendants or charges but summarized allegations against three people she said were “responsible for the violent destruction of Tesla properties.” She said they’ll “face the full force of the law for using Molotov cocktails to set fire to Tesla cars and charging stations.”\n\nBondi said in the release that “the days of committing crimes without consequence have ended” and “if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.”\n\nOne might object that the days of consequence-free crime haven’t so much “ended” as a new administration has new criminal justice priorities, beginning with Trump’s blanket pardoning of the Jan. 6 defendants. But each administration is entitled to its priorities within the confines of the law, and the DOJ’s latest announcement helps to solidify its policy of protecting those loyal to Trump and taking punitive action against others.\n\nOn that note, Ed Martin, the president’s pick to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the nation’s capital, has likewise pledged to bring the weight of the federal law against Musk’s opponents. And just this week, Bondi retweeted Musk’s posts about her Fox News television appearance and public statement touting law enforcement action against Tesla-related defendants.\n\nPutting aside the specifics of these cases, whatever criminal actions anyone takes against people or property shouldn’t escape prosecution based on the victim’s identity. That is, Musk’s person and property are no less legally deserving of protection than anyone else’s. But given the political incentive behind bringing these cases and any other related ones, they’ll deserve close scrutiny as they develop.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "content": "“How can President Donald Trump appeal to the Supreme Court on the issue of whether a district judge can block action nationwide when I don’t believe the issue has gone through lower courts?”\n\n— Tom Morris, Richmond, Virginia\n\nHi Tom,\n\nThere are different ways that cases get to the Supreme Court. The traditional route is for an issue to be fully litigated first through the trial and appellate courts, which can take years. Then there’s the route that the Trump administration took on birthright citizenship, which lands on the court’s so-called “shadow docket” or “emergency docket,” where the justices handle preliminary or urgent matters.\n\nHere’s how that background plays out in the birthright citizenship litigation. Federal trial judges in three states (Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington) preliminarily halted Trump’s attempt to restrict birthright citizenship. The administration went to the respective federal appeals courts to try to upend those trial-court orders, lost those efforts, and then went to the Supreme Court with applications that are still pending.\n\nAs you note, the issue the administration is pressing to the high court isn’t the constitutional merits of the birthright citizenship question per se but whether judges can block a move nationwide — instead of just helping the people who brought the lawsuits in these cases. Nationwide injunctions are an issue that’s applicable across all sorts of cases and one that Republican-appointed justices have criticized; along with the merits of the birthright citizenship issue not favoring the government, that could be what made taking the nationwide injunction issue to the justices a more attractive litigation strategy for the government rather than more directly and immediately seeking to upend a long-standing constitutional protection.\n\nNotably, the justices aren’t treating the Trump administration’s applications with much urgency. Trump’s acting solicitor general filed the applications to the high court on March 13, and the justices gave the opposing parties an April 4 deadline to respond. In the context of purported emergency litigation, that’s a luxurious timeline. Whether that reflects the high court’s skepticism of the government’s underlying argument on the merits of the birthright citizenship issue, something else or some combination of factors may become more apparent in retrospect when the court ultimately rules on the government’s applications. But in light of that relatively luxurious timeline, it will likely be at least a couple more weeks until we learn more about the court’s thinking.\n\nHave any questions or comments for me?

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "I grew up in middle-class America as the daughter of a teacher and a school psychologist, that is to parents who were lucky to receive a reasonable salary and excellent insurance and retirement benefits throughout their careers. They saved their money and helped put my sister and me through college and provided some support for me through medical school.\n\nThat’s why I never knew that my parents weren’t ready for retirement until it was obvious they weren’t. The cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid. Even though my family’s story is extremely common, the inability to pay mounting medical bills comes as a surprise to nearly all families, because few of us face the facts of aging until we have to.\n\nThe cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid.\n\nMy mom was the glue that held our family together and kept the household running. But when she started losing her memory around 60, running everything became Dad’s responsibility, and he already had a myriad of his own health problems: diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure. My sister and I were fairly oblivious then to what was happening. I was busy working full time and raising children, and she lived halfway around the world. Like many aging parents, ours insisted that everything was OK, and they did a pretty good job covering up that it wasn’t. But given the speed of Mom’s memory decline and the severity of Dad’s chronic illnesses, they couldn’t cover things up long.\n\nThe author poses with her parents at her 2007 medical school graduation. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nThey needed more care than they could provide each other and more than home health care visits could provide. They began by transitioning to what’s called “independent living” for my dad and assisted living for my mom. Even though my parents enjoyed comfortable retirement pensions, Social Security and private insurance, their new living arrangement was barely financially feasible, and I was constantly worried about what would happen when they needed a higher level of care.\n\nThis all came to a head about two years later when exacerbations of chronic health problems landed my father in the ICU. His health deteriorated so much with this hospitalization that it became obvious that he could no longer live independently. In fact, he needed so much help that he needed full-time skilled nursing — a nursing home. And I soon realized that despite my being a physician, there was so much that I didn’t know about nursing homes. I didn’t realize, for example, that my parents’ “good” private insurance didn’t cover nursing home care. But that’s fine, I thought; Dad’s old enough for Medicare. That’s when I learned Medicare doesn’t pay for nursing homes, either.\n\nThe private pay rate for the nursing home in his “life community,” I learned when I started investigating it, was $13,000 per month! I thought that surely was a mistake or that we had somehow chosen a particularly expensive place. But, no, in 2019 in greater Milwaukee, which has a relatively low cost of living, that price was about average. Some places cost slightly less, and some cost much more, but I, a physician, didn’t find a single place we could afford. We were already paying almost $6,000 per month for my mom’s assisted living. To pay for Dad’s nursing home care on top of that would have cost $200,000 per year, more than my parents ever made when they worked full time. They certainly didn’t have that kind of money saved.\n\nMy sister and I discussed one of us quitting our jobs but realized that even if one of us did, we couldn’t provide Dad the skilled care he needed at home. And neither of us could quit our jobs and still pay all our bills. I, specifically, was in the middle of the classic sandwich generation dilemma. I had a toddler and a child in elementary school. I was trying to pay off medical school loans, pay for child care, pay the mortgage, save for my kids’ college and my own retirement. Everything was untenable. We didn’t understand how people managed these situations.\n\nThe author with her sister and her parents for Christmas 2013. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nAn amazing social worker helped me understand that most non-wealthy Americans spend down their savings and apply for Medicaid. I was floored. My parents were average Americans with decent pensions and modest savings. What need did they have for Medicaid when they had private insurance? How could skilled nursing care cost so much that most people who need it are priced out of it?! That’s when I learned that Medicaid is how the majority of America receives skilled nursing care. At the time, 2019, Medicaid was the primary payer for 59% of nursing home care. As of July 2024, that proportion had risen to 63%.\n\nWhile enrolling my father was extremely complicated, I believe the process ensures that those who apply are truly eligible. What we learned is that almost all of my father’s pension and Social Security benefits went to pay his nursing home. He got to keep $30 per month for personal items. Also, the Medicaid negotiated rate for the nursing home was much lower than the $13,000 a month I’d been quoted. This arrangement was lifesaving for my father and will be lifesaving for my mother if she ever requires this level of care. The families of many elderly Americans may never imagine they’ll need Medicaid — until they need it.\n\nRepublicans are proposing $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts in programs that fall under the purview of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A cut of that magnitude would almost certainly slash Medicaid. That would be disastrous for the hundreds of thousands of elderly Americans who live in nursing facilities. The Republicans supporting this bill most likely have or will have family members who depend on Medicaid.\n\nIt’s wrong of Congress to take an ax to the floor of the boat keeping so many Americans afloat. Slashing Medicaid would be that kind of heartless move.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump’s hometown of New York City is ground zero for his assault on blue cities and states and their institutions.\n\nThe rule of law is being replaced with the whims of the president, and so far there’s no sign that any of the Democrats running to be mayor, including damaged incumbent Eric Adams, are up to the moment of protecting the city from Trump when needed.\n\nAdams is openly compromised. The other candidates have been more interested in talking about that or taking whacks at the front-runner, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, than in articulating how they’d stand up to this presidential pressure campaign hitting the city from all sides.\n\nThe rule of law is being replaced with the whims of the president.\n\nThere’s the $400 million in federal funding being withheld from Columbia University in a legally dubious move, at least until it complies with a sweeping and nebulous series of demands. These include a crackdown on anti-Israel protests and a masking ban at the same time that masked federal agents are picking up campus members and shipping them to Louisiana for deportation proceedings.\n\nThen there’s the executive order, a true bill of attainder, that threatened to destroy Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, one of the city’s most prominent law firms, for employing and working on behalf of the president’s real and perceived enemies. Trump said Thursday he’ll drop the order after the firm’s head went to the White House, which said he apologized for “wrongdoing” and agreed to provide $40 million in legal services to Trump-favored causes over his term. (Trump should update the title of his best-known book to “The Art of the Shakedown.”)\n\nTrump also imposed the legally dubious demand to shut down New York’s already federally approved and implemented congestion pricing plan, along with blackmail about cutting other federal funding unless Gov. Kathy Hochul complies and cuts out what Trump’s transportation secretary whined Thursday is “open disrespect of the federal government” in refusing to accept its made-up ultimatum.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department is also suing the state for refusing to let the feds use its DMV database, including undocumented immigrants with state driver’s licenses, as a de facto deportation list.\n\nAnd then there are the threats from Trump’s “border czar,” Tom Homan, about how “I don’t care what the judges think, I don’t care what the left thinks, we’re coming” and Homan’s open extortion of Mayor Adams — who is desperate to get a dispensation in the criminal corruption case against him — about how “I’ll be in his office, up his butt, saying where the hell is the agreement we came to” if the mayor doesn’t deliver much more cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, never mind New York’s sanctuary city laws.\n\nAs the hits keep coming with more on the way, Adams has said he won’t publicly criticize Trump or his administration, openly humiliating himself and the city he’s supposed to lead in the process.\n\nNew York City didn’t go red in 2024 by any measure, but it got notably less blue as Trump basically matched his 2020 numbers while Kamala Harris fell short of Joe Biden’s 2020 results in every single electoral district.\n\nA message to those Democrat skeptics: You can dislike any or all campus protesters, menacing street theater, white-collar law firms, congestion pricing, blue state governors, the far left or crooked mayors and still recognize that using the power of the federal government to target real or supposed “enemies” this way is deeply disturbing.\n\nTrump should update the title of his best-known book to ‘The Art of the Shakedown.’\n\nAnd that’s before getting to the wild terror claims being thrown around by the feds without even nominal attribution and the supposed gang members being shipped, without any evidence or hearing in a frontal assault on the judiciary and the rule of law itself, to a hellhole El Salvadoran prison.\n\nIf you thought the Biden administration was committing “lawfare” and are applauding Trump’s retribution tour, your complaint was not about having an “enemies list” — just with who was on it.\n\nTrump’s extortion scheme, demanding tribute from cities and elite institutions as if they were conquered territories, is about exacting punishment, of course, but it’s largely about compliance.\n\nLop off a few heads and other people get nervous about lifting theirs up. That goes for protesters and administrators and mayors and just about everyone else. The beatings will continue until morale improves.\n\nTrump’s big idea, if “idea” isn’t too generous a word, is to take hard, wild swings and expect everyone who doesn’t get hit to race to comply before the hammer comes down again — and to get in an as many swings as he can before courts or lawmakers or anyone else can even react.\n\nThat’s why Manhattan medical giant NYU Langone is scrubbing references to its “diverse students” and the word “marginalized” from its website and policy documents and reconsidering words as harmless as “vulnerable” for fear of incurring Trump’s ire.\n\nYou don’t need to love all things DEI to recognize that executive orders criminalizing an “ideology” without even defining it are meant to coerce silence and violate what had been the bedrock American principle that the government doesn’t get to pick speech winners and losers.\n\nThat crude approach appears to be working. It’s not just NYU Langone, which was unlucky enough to have its memo leak first. Nearly every lawyer is advising the institutions they work for to tone down their language, trim their sails and hope the lightning strikes someone else.\n\nColumbia’s board is reportedly trying to figure out how to meet Trump’s terms, including placing its Middle Eastern studies department in “academic receivership” despite the damage that would do to the institution’s independence — and despite the fact that Trump hasn’t even said he’ll restore the money if it complies, only that he won’t negotiate at all until it does.\n\nNew York has talked a big game about progressive values, but those are being tested as never before.\n\nOnly a handful of other schools have called out the shakedown, reversing the famous Benjamin Franklin quip at the signing of the Declaration of Independence about how “We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.” Most everyone is keeping quiet, hoping someone else gets hung first.\n\nNew York has talked a big game about progressive values, but those are being tested as never before. The rest of the country is watching to see how America’s biggest city, and Trump’s hometown, will handle the tough years ahead as voters decide whether to put up or shut up.\n\nIf there’s a mayoral candidate willing to actually lead before voters give them the job by talking about the tough times and hard choices that are coming as the federal government cuts funding to New York City and pressures whoever’s mayor to comply with his diktats, this is the time to find out if New Yorkers are serious or not about wanting a profile in courage.",

        "content": "Republicans are very upset with the federal judiciary. As the number of injunctions against the Trump administration runs into the double digits — one of the latest indefinitely blocked Trump’s ban on transgender service members — the rage and name-calling is only getting worse.\n\n“This is tyranny. A small handful of marxist judges trying to run the entire country,” lamented Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.\n\n“District Court judges have issued RECORD numbers of national injunctions against the Trump administration,” complained Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, “a dramatic abuse of judicial authority.”\n\nIf the Trump administration wants an end to the seemingly endless adverse federal judgments against its policies, there is a relatively simple and elegant solution.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, the nation’s highest-ranking law enforcement figure, accused federal Judge James Boasberg, who blocked the recent deportation of hundreds of legal Venezuelan immigrants, of “meddling in our government.” One can assume that Bondi was absent the day her law school professors discussed the separation of powers and explained that the federal judiciary is a co-equal branch of the federal government.\n\nFor his part, Trump called Boasberg a “radical left lunatic” and demanded his impeachment — a move that led Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to publicly, albeit not directly, criticize the president.\n\nHowever, if the Trump administration wants an end to the seemingly endless adverse federal judgments against its policies, there is a relatively simple and elegant solution.\n\nSTOP BREAKING THE LAW.\n\nThe Trump administration complaining about meddlesome federal judges is like Al Capone complaining about snooping Treasury agents — or John Dillinger complaining about intruding bank guards.\n\nThere is a very easy explanation for why Trump’s policies keep getting blocked by federal judges: They are illegal.\n\nOne would think that Trump would be used to this by now. In his first term, there were 64 federal injunctions slapped on his initiatives — double the number in the George W. Bush, Obama and Biden administrations combined.\n\nRather than the endless whining about the federal judiciary, the Trump administration should call a timeout and get everyone who works in the White House and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to spend the day reading the Constitution. When they finish that bit of civic education they could search up Marbury v. Madison, the Supreme Court ruling that establishes the principle of judicial review and makes the country’s highest court the arbiter of what is and isn’t constitutional.\n\nHad White House lawyers taken the time to leaf through the country’s founding legal document, they might not have been upbraided by a federal judge who ruled that DOGE’s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development “likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.”\n\nA quick perusal of the 14th Amendment might have also prevented Trump from signing an executive order to end birthright citizenship — an order that’s been blocked by three federal judges, one of whom called the proclamation “blatantly unconstitutional.”\n\nThe greatest threat to American democracy is not federal judges who have read the Constitution and are faithfully interpreting the law.\n\nAfter Trump issued an executive order seeking to punish the law firm Perkins Coie for having previously worked with Hillary Clinton by terminating any federal contracts with the firm and barring government employees from working with its attorneys, federal Judge Beryl Howell said the edict “sends little chills down my spine.” She compared Trump’s order to a “bill of attainder,” a legislative act that declares someone guilty of a crime and mandates a punishment without a trial or due process. Trump administration lawyers could have read up about bills of attainder by reviewing Article 1, Section 9, which expressly forbids them. (Unfortunately, when the same executive order was issued against the New York-based law firm Paul Weiss, the firm wilted under pressure and pledged $40 million in pro bono work in support of Trump administration priorities.)\n\nA better understanding of federal law could have stopped the Trump administration from firing hundreds of thousands of probationary employees, a move that federal courts have repeatedly stymied — in some cases forcing federal agencies to rehire some of those who’ve been let go.\n\nThe same can be said for Trump’s efforts to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, freeze federal spending and enact a new National Institutes of Health policy ​​capping reimbursements for medical research grants. Federal judges have blocked all three initiatives.\n\nUnsurprisingly, none of this has stopped the Trump administration from continuing to issue blatantly illegal presidential edicts. Just yesterday, Trump signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, even though such an action can only be taken by Congress. If, and likely when, Trump’s latest executive order is blocked, he and his cronies will whine about the unfairness of the federal judiciary … but all of this is entirely predictable.\n\nEarlier this week, when a federal judge blocked DOGE’s efforts to dismantle USAID, Trump complained that “rogue judges … are destroying our country.” But as is so often the case with Trump and his minions, every accusation is a confession.\n\nThe greatest threat to American democracy is not federal judges who have read the Constitution and are faithfully interpreting the law. Instead it’s a rogue White House that is consistently breaking the law, acting outside its constitutional powers and then complaining that judges are treating it unfairly.\n\nIf Trump wants to stop getting slapped down by federal judges, there’s a simple solution — abide by the law.",

        "content": "NBC News reported this week that President Donald Trump’s administration is thinking about getting rid of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s division that focuses on HIV prevention and giving those responsibilities to the Department of Health and Human Services. There’s apparently another potential plan, a source told NBC News, that would cut up to $700 million from the CDC’s HIV division.\n\nAs a person who was diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 2006, I’m dreading what comes next.\n\nAs a person who was diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 2006, I’m dreading what comes next. Just how far will any of this go or end? When I was diagnosed, I was prescribed antiretrovirals, and, within months, my viral load dropped to undetectable levels. The virus has remained undetectable since then, and I am now healthy and thriving. I’ve come a long way from the opportunistic infections I was constantly dealing with at the time of my diagnosis.\n\nThen, I was barely insured and terrified that I might never recover. Within months, my insurer rescinded my health insurance policy. How was I going to pay out of pocket for the costly medications I needed to keep me alive?\n\nI soon learned about the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act. It provides HIV primary care, treatment and supportive services for low-income people living with HIV. The law provides a safety net that covers the copays for my HIV prescription, which would otherwise cost about $4,000 a month. This is stabilizing for my physical and mental health.\n\nPeople living with HIV work very hard to suppress the virus so that it cannot be detected in our blood because if the virus is undetectable, then it is “untransmittable.” That is, it cannot be passed on to others through sex. In short, treatment is everything, and treatment is prevention.\n\nKnowing we cannot expose our partners to HIV and pose no threat to others is affirming and liberating. It allows us to safely have pleasurable relationships with others and make babies.\n\nThe Trump administration has already worked to eliminate USAID and hamper PEPFAR (President Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), which is credited with saving more than 26 million lives in 55 countries since its creation in 2003. Now, the CDC may be eliminating funding for HIV prevention or incorporating it into HHS’s Ryan White program. I and others in my community are nervous for the future of HIV treatment and the future of HIV prevention.\n\nTreatment is everything, and treatment is prevention.\n\nState and local health departments and community-based nonprofits depend on the CDC’s HIV division for HIV testing, HIV education, funding for the pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, funding and technical support in public health efforts. Removing funding for this could potentially fuel new cases. PrEP, when used correctly, can stop someone from acquiring HIV during intimate encounters.\n\nShoehorning HIV prevention services into the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, which provides HIV care, could overburden the program. Resources to serve the 1.2 million people living with HIV in the U.S. are already stretched thin. Resources can be even scarcer in the Deep South, especially in its rural and urban areas.\n\nAt the same time, House Republicans seem bent on slashing Medicaid.\n\nMany low-income or disabled people living with HIV depend on Medicaid for health care.\n\nI am more concerned than ever about the unraveling of safety nets that wrap around not only people living with HIV but anyone with a chronic health condition. Some days, everything seems under threat.\n\nTrump’s flurry of executive orders against DEI pose a particular danger to people like me, a Black person and member of the LGBTQ community. Many HIV prevention and treatment programs focus on LGBTQ people (sometimes trans people in particular), Black people and women. These programs for treatment and prevention may not be in alignment with Trump’s anti-DEI agenda.\n\nUntil this week, there was not a lot of talk from leaders in the HIV-positive community about preparing people living with HIV for potential service interruptions. In their defense, they didn’t have a crystal ball to predict this, and they have received no guidance from federal funding agencies. Nevertheless, that failure to plan or consider contingencies does not help clients or patients sleep better at night.\n\nWe can see from PEPFAR the consequences of reduced services or zero funding. Millions of lives are affected and rationing of medication and care has started in Africa.\n\nWhen might we need to start to rationing medication or care in the U.S.? I could probably last a couple of months but what then? Being undetectable and healthy is great. We’re living long lives now and getting old.\n\nToo many have fought hard to get the science where it is and to get the funding where it is.\n\nEven though I am trying to remain hopeful that any reshuffling of the CDC or Ryan White will be minimal, I realize hope is not a strategy. Too many have fought hard to get the science where it is and to get the funding where it is.\n\nLast year, I traveled to the southwest corner of France and noticed that many of the road signs were turned upside down. I was told farmers did that to protest government policies they opposed.\n\nIt seems to me that now’s the time to turn some things upside down in this country and fight back. We cannot let Trump make HIV a fatal disease again.",

        "title": "Trump’s FTC firings underscore his commitment to big businesses and billionaires",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump attempted to fire the two Democratic commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission, even though he can only fire the congressionally-appointed commissioners for cause. It marks a very sudden end — at least for now — to the agency’s efforts to enforce antitrust laws and consumer protections. And it’s another sign Donald Trump is governing not on behalf of the people but for the benefit of America’s biggest and most powerful businesses and billionaires. Furthermore, if the courts uphold this action — a big if — it will endanger the independence of every government agency that is designed to be insulated from day-to-day political White House pressures.\n\nWhy Trump decided to do this is a mystery. The FTC has five members, three from the president’s political party and two from the opposition. It’s not as though the two jettisoned commissioners controlled the FTC — they represented the minority Democratic Party. Earlier this week, FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson defended the structure of the FTC on the Bloomberg podcast Odd Lots: “If you have an agency that is exceeding the law, abusing the companies that it purports to regulate, it’s helpful for markets, for courts, for litigants, for government transparency to have people in the other party pointing this out.”\n\nThis is corruption, plain and simple.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya\n\nOf course, that’s almost certainly the point of ditching the two commissioners. For decades, antitrust law was ignored and dismissed by administrations from both parties and even by those who were charged with enforcing those laws. Biden-era FTC Chair Lina Khan reinvigorated and restored antitrust law (and was reviled by billionaires and many on Wall Street as a result). Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter, the Democratic commissioners Trump wants to deep-six, are committed to her vision.\n\nUnder Khan, the FTC sued Amazon in two separate civil suits, alleging, among other things, that the company is using monopoly power over the smaller businesses that sell through their site to raise prices across the internet. The two commissioners are responsible for enforcing a privacy consent decree against X. At the same time, agency staff began strengthening internet privacy rules — something that affects platforms like Meta’s Facebook and Instagram. They were also in the early stages of attempting to bring America’s soaring pharmaceutical prices under control. And the agency is suing the country’s three largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), alleging they colluded to increase the price of insulin.\n\nAll of these FTC actions are presumably in deep jeopardy as the remaining Republican commissioners’ commitment to this agenda is tenuous at best. Trump campaigned on cracking down on PBMs, bringing down the cost of living and corralling Big Tech. These are all of huge importance to the Democratic commissioners, yet the White House claimed in their note to Bedoya and Slaughter, “Your continued service on the F.T.C. is inconsistent with my administration’s priorities.”\n\nIt’s hard to see how — unless that is, you view it in the greater context of Big Tech and Big Business warmly embracing Trump. X owner Elon Musk donated more than $250 million to get him elected, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave generously to his inauguration committee, and Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos bought the rights to a Melania Trump documentary and purchased streaming rights to all 15 seasons of \"The Apprentice,\" pouring millions upon millions of dollars directly into the Trump family coffers. All have been rewarded with White House access and, in Musk’s case, the opportunity to slash the federal government bureaucracy and fire government workers at a whim.\n\n“This is corruption, plain and simple,” Bedoya said on a Tuesday night press call. “Who does this attempt to remove us help? Because it doesn’t help regular people trying to, struggling to pay the bills and struggling to pay the rent. Who it helps is billionaires, and I think it opens the door for corruption, and for a law enforcement apparatus that is controlled not by the law, but by money.”\n\nYou shouldn’t need to love antitrust policy or the Federal Reserve to understand why this is bad.\n\nBut there’s something else possibly happening here, too. Almost a century ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to fire a Republican-appointed member of the FTC. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a president can only fire congressionally appointed agency heads for cause. Disagreement isn’t good enough. Trump’s actions are not only illegal and unlawful, but they threaten other government agencies — including, crucially from Wall Street’s perspective, the Federal Reserve. If the Supreme Court rules that Trump can jettison the FTC commissioners — yes, this is heading to court — who's to say he’ll stop there? “If I can be fired, I don’t know why Jerome Powell can’t be fired,” Slaughter said Tuesday on CNBC.\n\nYou shouldn’t need to love antitrust policy or the Federal Reserve to understand why this is bad. The politicization of regulation and policy is, by definition, destabilizing to the greater economy. Decisions that appear to be made for the benefit of favored oligarchs do not make for a healthy business environment, which demands a fair application of the rule of law. It enables a corrupt economy, where money and power flow to the very top, and the rest of us, individuals and smaller honest businesses alike, are seen as so much prey. This is what Khan, Bedoya and Slaughter attempted to stop and put in reverse.\n\nOligarchs — from either party — who are used to operating without checks on their power never want cops on the beat. We saw it during the presidential election when billionaire supporters of Kamala Harris tried to bully her into committing to ditching Khan if she won, and we saw it again earlier this year when the Trump administration attempted to destroy the Consumer Federation Protection Bureau. Now, it’s playing out at the FTC, where the Trump administration is willing to break the law to get the white-collar cops to stand down.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As Tesla stock continues to fall and the company’s dealerships become the site of protests, Tesla owners are trading in their electric vehicles at a record rate, according to new data from Edmunds, a national car shopping website.\n\nIn the first two weeks of March, “Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in,” Reuters reported, citing data from Edmunds. That represents a 0.2% increase from Tesla trade-ins from the prior month, according to the data. Reuters adds that “March’s trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues.”\n\nThose numbers don’t bode well for a company that has suffered embarrassing setbacks in recent months. Safety regulators issued a sweeping recall of more than 46,000 Cybertrucks on Thursday — the eighth such recall since the vehicles began selling more than a year ago — because Tesla used faulty glue that can allow an exterior panel to come off. The company’s stock has also been sliding fairly steadily since the end of December, raising concerns among shareholders and employees.\n\nMusk has tried to calm those nerves internally, telling employees in an all-hands meeting Thursday to hang onto their stock despite its sinking value.\n\n“If you read the news it feels like, you know, Armageddon,” Musk said on a livestream with employees. “It’s like, I can’t walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. Like, what’s going on?\"\n\nIt’s hard to tell how directly Tesla’s woes are tied to public disdain for Musk’s haphazard shakeup of the federal bureaucracy. But Tesla owners and facilities have certainly borne the brunt of the billionaire’s unpopularity with the American public. Across the country, Tesla vehicles and charging stations have been vandalized, and its dealerships have faced protests from angry crowds.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have mobilized to protect Musk’s interests. President Donald Trump held a bizarre event on the White House South Lawn to tout Tesla vehicles. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urged Fox News viewers to buy the company’s stock — a move that seem to instantly backfire and may open Lutnick up to a congressional ethics investigation. And on Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced criminal charges against three people accused of the “violent destruction of Tesla properties” in what appear to be unrelated incidents.\n\n“Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,” Bondi said in a statement.",

        "title": "Republicans want to pretend their tax cuts are free. A new report says otherwise.",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Republicans have a trifecta, which means they’re trying to pass more expensive tax cuts that will disproportionately go to the rich.\n\nHow expensive? They’ll cost $4 trillion over the next decade and would increase upward pressure on the debt ratio by 50 percent. How disproportionate? America’s top 0.1% would get a tax cut of $278,000 while 28 million households in the bottom 80 percent would have no change in their tax bill and 14 million in the bottom 80 percent would actually have their taxes go up.\n\nIn looking for ways to extend those cuts, Republicans face two problems.\n\nWhat’s different is that, this time around, much of what they’re trying to do is currently in effect but set to expire — and Republicans are not pretending the tax cuts will pay for themselves (because they don’t). Instead — and I am not making this up — they’ve just decided to say the costs don’t count. They’re free.\n\nHow did we get here? Back in 2017, Trump and congressional Republicans enacted the Trump tax cuts. Because they used a process known as budget reconciliation — the same process they’re using now — most of those cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.\n\nIn looking for ways to extend those cuts, Republicans face two problems.\n\nFirst, the tax cuts cost $4 trillion over the 10-year budget window, and Republicans can’t even get close to finding a way to pay for them, but some of them don’t feel comfortable with adding that much to the deficit. The House GOP’s proposal attempts to offset some of the extension by kicking millions of people off Medicaid and cutting food benefits down to just $1.67 per person per meal on average. Yet deficits would still increase by around $3 trillion over the decade.\n\nThe second problem is that, in order to pass a bill under reconciliation, the bill’s costs beyond the tenth year have to be fully paid for. If Republicans want to make these tax cuts permanent, they must find a way to pay for them in the long term. Given that their conference can’t even really agree on the cuts to pay for one-third of their tax bill, getting the votes for much bigger cuts would be an enormous lift.\n\nSo, now Republicans have a new strategy: pretend the tax cuts are free. Magic!\n\nThey’re claiming that, because we’ve already been incurring the costs, continuing them shouldn’t count as a new cost. Republicans endorsing this strategy include House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who says the Trump White House favors the strategy.\n\nThe CBO’s report goes on to say that extending the Trump tax cuts would harm the economy and increase consumers’ borrowing costs.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this is an enormous gimmick. The most fundamental rule of budget scorekeeping is that all costs are always scored at some point. You can score them all up front, or you can score them again and again as you keep extending the program. But what Republicans are asking for, despite getting scored on a temporary basis in 2017 when the tax provisions were first enacted and thus getting to avoid being scored for some of the cost, is to now be scored as free to continue. That means some of the costs would never be scored. No program in the entire budget receives that treatment.\n\nBut while Republicans can pretend the costs are free, the Treasury Department will have to finance these expensive tax cuts. That means incurring new debt.\n\nOn Friday, the Congressional Budget Office released a report estimating that permanently extending the Trump tax cuts without paying for them would in fact be very costly. The national debt “would reach 214 percent of GDP in 2054, 47 percentage points higher” than if the tax cuts aren’t extended. The CBO’s report goes on to say that extending the Trump tax cuts would harm the economy and increase consumers’ borrowing costs.\n\nFor the moment, the scoring method used isn’t entirely in Republicans’ hands. The Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s expert on procedure and precedents, advises on whether bills meet the rules for reconciliation, and she is unlikely to let Republicans pretend their tax cuts are free.\n\nWe’ll likely know the parliamentarian’s answer within the next few weeks. If, as expected, she says no, Republicans have four options: accept her ruling, fire her, ignore her or vote on whether to overrule her — which would require only a simple majority. Depending on their choice, we’ll know whether Republicans will use make-believe to protect the wealthiest Americans, or whether we’ll remain tethered to reality.",

        "title": "Trump’s Justice Department seeks to shield president in Jan. 6 civil cases",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In the recent past, there was reason to believe Donald Trump might face criminal accountability for Jan. 6 and his actions after his 2020 defeat. Those hopes were dashed, however, by the results of the 2024 election and the demise of former special counsel Jack Smith’s case against the president.\n\nThere is, however, another potential avenue for accountability — a series of civil lawsuits filed against Trump — though as The New York Times reported, the Justice Department appears to be taking steps to derail this option, too.\n\nThe Justice Department made an unusual effort on Thursday to short-circuit a series of civil lawsuits seeking to hold President Trump accountable for his supporters’ attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Department lawyers argued in court papers filed to the judge overseeing the cases that Mr. Trump was acting in his official capacity as president on Jan. 6 and so the federal government itself should take his place as the defendant. That move, if successful, could protect Mr. Trump from having to face judgment for his role in the Capitol attack and from having to pay financial damages if he were found liable.\n\nThe Times’ report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that the legal maneuver appeared to be the latest effort to use the powers of the Justice Department to Trump’s advantage “by effectively having himself removed from the lawsuits.”\n\nFor those who might benefit from a refresher, in the aftermath of the insurrectionist violence, among those who filed lawsuits against Trump were police officers injured during the insurrectionist violence. In fact, multiple cases were filed:\n\nIn March 2021, two Capitol Police officers, James Blassingame and Sidney Hemby, sued Trump, claiming he was liable for the injuries they suffered during the riot.\n\nIn August 2021, seven more police officers who were attacked and beaten during the Capitol riot sued the former president.\n\nIn January 2022, three more police officers — including two who aided the evacuation of lawmakers — sued Trump, seeking damages for their physical and emotional injuries.\n\nIn January 2023, the longtime partner of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died after the Jan. 6 riot, filed a wrongful death civil suit against Trump.\n\nThose civil cases have since been consolidated and are pending before U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta.\n\nTo be sure, even if Trump were to lose the civil suits, there would be no criminal consequences, but they could prove to be politically embarrassing and financially costly. Indeed, let’s not forget that he has suffered several major legal setbacks and defeats in recent years — the E. Jean Carroll case, the Trump Organization’s fraud case, the demise of his fraudulent charity, the demise of his fraudulent “university,” et al. — and those were all civil cases.\n\nWhat’s more, while the Justice Department has a policy prohibiting federal criminal charges against a sitting president, the Supreme Court has already ruled that sitting presidents can face civil suits while in office, and claims from Trump’s lawyers that he’s immune in these cases have already been rejected by two courts.\n\nIt’s against this backdrop that the Justice Department decided to intervene. The Times’ report added, “The department has argued that under the law federal officials acting within the scope of their office or employment cannot be sued personally, and that in such instances the government is the only entity that can be targeted.”\n\nIt’s an argument rooted in the idea that those who claim to have been harmed by the president’s actions on Jan. 6 should be able to sue the federal government, but shouldn’t be able to sue the Republican directly.\n\nWill this work? Watch this space.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

I was its chairman in 2009 shortly after the transformative victory of President Barack Obama and Democratic dominance in both chambers of Congress. The late Sen. John McCain had been the party’s nominee in 2008 and then-Gov. Mitt Romney would be its nominee in the next cycle.\n\nThese former figureheads of the party are now considered by Trump’s acolytes as RINOs, Republicans in Name Only. MAGA Republicans fantasize about McCain roasting in hell. Conservative heavy-hitters like Matt Schlapp say Romney’s physical safety would be jeopardized if he so much as attended the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nThe \"old\" Republican Party is gone. It sold its soul to Trump in return for two presidencies and three Supreme Court seats.\n\nOne by one, the Republicans who stood up to Trump in the beginning have either left politics or capitulated, often in humiliating fashion.\n\nAfter Trump insulted his wife’s appearance and lied about his father during the 2016 presidential primary, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could have continued calling Trump out as a “sniveling coward.” Instead, he became one of his sniveling supporters.\n\nWhen Trump dragged him into a stomach-turning exchange about genital size on a national debate stage, then-Sen. Marco Rubio could have insisted to Republican voters that their rhetoric had to rise above Trump’s brazen behavior. Instead, he now serves as Trump’s Secretary of State.\n\nTrump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives.\n\nSome of this is careerism. Trump has shown that he can turn the Republican base against even the most stalwart conservatives, which leaves those who want to remain in elected office with a choice: debase themselves to gain power or stick to their principles and be cast aside like Romney and McCain.\n\nBut the truth is Republicans capitulate even when it's not necessary. Far too many of today’s Republicans are unwilling to call out Trump's seedy dealings with Russia, heed warnings about the perils of relying too heavily on tariffs or stand with law enforcement over pro-Trump extremists — all positions that are unpopular with broad swaths of voters.\n\nAnother reason the Republican Party I once led is never seeing a revival? Republican voters don’t want to revive it. In fact, MAGA officials repeatedly race to outdo each others’ depravity because they know today’s Republican voters will reward them for it.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, who once envisioned a Republican Party that carved out space for LGBTQ+ rights, now fundraises on a bizarre obsession with trans people’s bathroom habits.\n\nFar-right Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once considered a fringe conspiracy theorist by people with multiple brain cells, is now one of the party's leading political figures and the top congressional fundraiser in her state.\n\nEven Trump’s most unhinged Cabinet picks were awarded confirmations not despite their lack of experience or support for conspiracy theories, but because of them.\n\nAnd there’s Trump, whose criminal indictments and even convictions became a cause célèbre and his highest fundraising days of the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe old Republican Party is not coming back. Those bridges have been burned by Republicans. The sooner Schumer and those Republicans interested in the re-emergence of traditional republicanism understand this reality, the sooner we move on from Trumpism. But sitting back and waiting for the GOP to \"expel\" Trump won't change a thing.\n\nFor more thought-provoking insights from Michael Steele, Alicia Menendez and Symone Sanders-Townsend, watch “The Weekend” every Saturday and Sunday at 8 a.m. ET on MSNBC.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Columbia University has agreed to most of the demands issued last week by the government, setting the stage to begin negotiations on restoring $400 million in federal funding and becoming the latest institution to capitulate to President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a memo issued Friday afternoon, the university said it will ban face masks “for the purpose of concealing one’s identity”; hire 36 “special officers” empowered to arrest students and remove them from campus; appoint a senior vice provost to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies; adopt a formal definition of antisemitism; review its admission procedures to ensure those processes are “unbiased”; and commit to “greater institutional neutrality” — most of which address demands from the Trump administration.\n\nIn early March, the administration pulled $400 million in federal grants from the university, citing its “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” The administration subsequently issued a list of demands to Columbia “as a precondition for formal negotiations.”\n\nThe government’s demand that Columbia place its Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department under “academic receivership” was particularly alarming. Academics told The New York Times they had never witnessed such a blatant effort by the federal government to intervene in a private institution.\n\nThe Trump administration’s targeting of Columbia forced the university into a difficult corner. Katrina Armstrong, Columbia’s interim president, said that the loss of the federal funds would have an immediate impact “on research and other critical functions of the University, impacting students, faculty, staff, research, and patient care.”\n\nStill, Columbia’s sweeping concessions to the administration represent a remarkable moment in academia — and in the university’s history. Academics at Columbia and beyond have expressed dismay at the precedent the school is setting as Trump continues his effort to put educational institutions under his heel.\n\nJameel Jaffer, the director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, responded to the news in a social media post: “A sad day for Columbia and for our democracy.”\n\nThe administration could ultimately decide not to restore federal funds to Columbia, despite the university’s submission to its demands. Neither Trump nor the White House has publicly responded to the announcement of Columbia’s policy changes.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has railed in recent weeks against federal judges who have ruled against his administration, painting them as threats to the country and demanding that the Supreme Court halt all nationwide injunctions.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social Thursday, Trump attacked the judges who have issued injunctions against his policies, calling them “radical left judges” and “lunatics” who “want to assume the Powers of the Presidency, without having to attain 80 Million Votes.” (Trump won the 2024 election with 77 million votes, and federal judges are appointed to their positions, not elected.)\n\n“STOP NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” he added, before calling on Chief Justice John Roberts to intervene. “If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!”\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump again suggested in a Truth Social post that federal judges are attempting to “assume the duties of the President of the United States.”\n\nWith more than 100 lawsuits against Trump’s policies to date, the administration has claimed that judges are improperly using nationwide injunctions to impede the president’s agenda and to override his executive powers. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused those judges of being “partisan activists.”\n\n“They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States,” she said. “They are trying to clearly slow-walk this administration’s agenda, and it’s unacceptable.”\n\nNationwide injunctions have stymied both Republican and Democratic presidents in the past. However, Trump and his allies argue that his administration has faced more injunctions than any other in recent decades. According to the Harvard Law Review, Trump faced 64 injunctions in his first term in office, far more than any president since 2001.\n\nBut Trump has wielded executive power in ways that other presidents have not, and in his second term, he has aggressively sought to expand the boundaries of his office. As my colleague Steve Benen pointed out, Republicans are leaning on the assumption that courts are engaged in a widespread conspiracy to undermine Trump’s agenda, rather than face the more straightforward explanation that his actions may simply be at odds with the law.\n\nNevertheless, the president and his billionaire ally Elon Musk have also called for judges who rule against the administration to be impeached, which provoked Roberts to take the rare step of issuing a statement saying “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”\n\nThe Justice Department is currently awaiting the Supreme Court’s ruling on a request to narrow orders from several judges who have blocked Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order from taking effect nationwide. But as The Associated Press pointed out, the high court appears to be in no hurry to decide.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Welcome back, Deadline: Legal Newsletter readers. We started the week with more questions about the Trump administration’s compliance with court orders. The government’s answers haven’t impressed Washington, D.C.’s chief federal trial judge, James Boasberg. When President Donald Trump called for impeaching the judge, Chief Justice John Roberts made a rare public statement, reiterating that the proper response to an adverse ruling is an appeal, not an impeachment.\n\n“Woefully insufficient” is what Boasberg called the Justice Department’s latest explanation on Thursday. He had ordered the government to halt deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century law that Trump invoked to summarily remove alleged Venezuelan gang members. But while the administration appeals Boasberg's temporary restraining orders, the judge is examining whether officials deliberately flouted his orders. At a hearing Friday, he said he’ll get to the bottom of whether they were violated and what the consequences will be.\n\nThe judge gave the government until Tuesday to file a brief explaining how it didn’t violate his orders by failing to return people removed from the U.S. on planes last weekend. We’ll be following the latest compliance saga into next week while litigation moves forward on the DOJ’s bid to overturn the judge’s restraining orders, with a federal appeals court hearing set for Monday.\n\nCalls to impeach judges like Boasberg who rule against Trump aren't a new phenomenon in his second term. But they have escalated with the president’s backing and support from the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, who helped return Trump to the White House. And while threats to judges rise, Musk is financially backing Republicans who support judicial impeachments.\n\nMusk’s effective merger with the government is at least one of the biggest stories of Trump 2.0. While he supports the MAGA movement, the Trump-led government supports him. Recent examples include the president touting Musk’s Tesla vehicles on the White House lawn, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urging people to buy Tesla stock and Attorney General Pam Bondi prioritizing prosecutions of people who allegedly harm Tesla property.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s vengeance against disfavored law firms featured a capitulation this week. After a judge blocked the president’s order targeting the Perkins Coie firm last week, it looked like Trump’s similar order against another big firm, Paul Weiss, would meet the same fate in court. The president had targeted the latter firm for its association with Mark Pomerantz, who investigated Trump in what became his only criminal case that went to trial before the election, ending in guilty verdicts on 34 counts of falsifying business records. (The president is appealing.)\n\nBut rather than challenge the order in court, where the odds of success would have been high given Perkins Coie’s success, Paul Weiss made a deal. However little the White House gained on paper from the agreement, the mere fact of the settlement sets a precedent that the president’s overtly retaliatory actions are something to be managed rather than challenged.\n\nAt the Supreme Court, Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch was the lone GOP appointee to dissent from the court’s 5-4 refusal to halt the execution of Jessie Hoffman on Tuesday. The Buddhist death row prisoner had argued that Louisiana’s nitrogen gas execution method would violate his religious rights because, he said, it would interfere with his meditative breathing as he died. Gorsuch said he would’ve blocked the execution to let Hoffman pursue his claim.\n\nIt wasn’t Gorsuch’s only notable split from colleagues in a criminal case. On Friday, he dissented from Justice Clarence Thomas’ majority ruling about what technically counts as a violent crime. The Trump appointee was joined by Biden appointee Ketanji Brown Jackson, a pairing that might sound unusual at first glance but is far from unprecedented.\n\nHeading into the home stretch of the high court term, the March argument session starts Monday with a hearing over racial gerrymandering in Louisiana. The court’s regularly scheduled hearings wrap up in April, and the justices usually issue the final opinions by July. On top of those pending cases — with rulings still due on ghost guns, transgender rights and more — Trump’s executive actions could add further emergency litigation for the justices to decide. More on that subject in this week’s “Ask Jordan” feature.\n\nHave any questions or comments for me? I’d love to hear from you!

        "title": "The biggest (and most avoidable) mistake in Trump’s release of the JFK assassination files",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump took a moment at an Oval Office event to brag about his decision to release thousands of documents related to John F. Kennedy’s assassination, which he characterized as a great breakthrough. Unprompted, however, the president brought up a serious point of contention.\n\n“We even released Social Security numbers; I didn’t want anything deleted,” he told reporters. “They said, ‘Sir, what about Social Security numbers?’ ... But they’re long gone. I can’t imagine.”\n\nEvidently, the president isn’t keeping up on current events. The New York Times reported:\n\nThe Trump administration scrambled to minimize fallout on Thursday after exposing personal information, including Social Security numbers, of hundreds of congressional staff members, intelligence researchers and even an ambassador when releasing files pertaining to the death of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nI realize the Trump White House has faced important questions about its competence, but it would’ve been easy to avoid this humiliation.\n\nOn Monday, the president directed the National Archives to disclose 64,000 pages of documents related to Kennedy’s 1963 assassination. On Tuesday, the materials were released to the public — unredacted.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House decided it’d probably be a good idea to check to see if officials, following Trump’s explicit order, had just exposed the Social Security numbers of living people. And on Thursday, the Republican team acknowledged that there was a problem.\n\nThe president might be under the impression that the relevant people are “long gone,” but that’s not even close to being true: In fact, Joe diGenova — Trump’s own former campaign lawyer — was one of the people whose Social Security number was released to the public.\n\nWhat’s more, the problem isn’t limited to Social Security numbers: Birthdates, birthplaces and other private information — related to living people — was also released as part of the same exercise.\n\nIf you’re wondering whether all of this suggests that the White House violated federal private laws in the course of this debacle, plenty of experts suggested that the answer is yes. There might even be litigation as a result of Trump’s screw-up.\n\nThe Washington Post reported, “Many whose Social Security numbers were exposed had become high-ranking officials in Washington. They include a former assistant secretary of state, a former U.S. ambassador, researchers in the intelligence world, State Department workers and prominent lawyers.”\n\nIn the hopes of putting things right, the White House directed the Social Security Administration to issue new numbers to the affected people, as well as offering free credit monitoring.\n\nBecause if there’s one thing people in their 80s and 90s want to deal with, it’s to start over with new Social Security numbers and incorporate those into their financial lives.\n\nThe New York Times’ report added administration officials “knew before the documents went out that releasing them without redactions would expose some personal information,” and while that might seem outrageous, Trump confirmed this morning that when he was confronted with this warning, he chose to ignore it because he assumed all of the relevant people would be dead.\n\nMany of the relevant people are, however, alive and well — but suddenly worried about being doxxed.\n\nIt’s possible at this point that some readers might be thinking to themselves, “This might be awful for those affected by the White House’s latest fiasco, and I’m relieved that I’m not involved.” And while that would be an understandable reaction, let’s not forget that Team Trump isn’t exactly going out of its way to protect everyone else’s private Social Security information, either. The Washington Post also reported:\n\nA federal judge on Thursday barred U.S. DOGE Service employees from accessing sensitive Social Security Administration data and ordered members of the team led by Elon Musk to delete any personally identifiable information it has obtained from the agency. On the broad premise of rooting out fraud within the federal government, about a dozen Musk-aligned tech engineers gained access to databases containing reams of taxpayer information.\n\n“To facilitate this expedition, SSA provided members of the SSA DOGE Team with unbridled access to the personal and private data of millions of Americans,” U.S. District Court Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander wrote. That included access to “Social Security numbers, medical records, mental health records, hospitalization records, drivers’ license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income history, work history, birth and marriage certificates, and home and work addresses.”\n\nIn the process, the judge added, the Trump administration exposed “personal, confidential, sensitive, and private information that millions of Americans entrusted to their government.”\n\nI have a hunch we haven’t heard the last of this story.",

        "title": "Trump’s FCC leader threatens to kill mergers over DEI policies",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s handpicked appointee sitting atop the Federal Communications Commission declared Friday that his agency is prepared to block mergers and attempted acquisitions involving companies that promote what he called “invidious” diversity policies.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on Friday, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr openly said: “Any businesses that are looking for FCC approval, I would encourage them to get busy ending any sort of their invidious forms of DEI discrimination.” The outlet also quoted him as saying: “If there’s businesses out there that are still promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination, I really don’t see a path forward where the FCC could reach the conclusion that approving the transaction is going to be in the public interest.”\n\nAccording to the report, Carr specifically mentioned Paramount Global’s merger with Skydance Media as well as Verizon Communications Inc.’s acquisition of Frontier Communications Parent Inc. as deals that are potentially in doubt as a result.\n\nIn reality, DEI programs help foster work environments that studies have shown are more productive than ones where diversity, equity and inclusion aren’t emphasized. But the MAGA movement has falsely portrayed these programs, which vary and have been known to benefit all kinds of races, genders, religions and socioeconomic classes, as discriminatory toward white men.\n\nIn Carr’s threat, we see the Trump administration flexing its authoritarian powers in an attempt to subjugate American media outlets in ways that Hungary’s illiberal leader, Viktor Orbán, advised Republicans to do back in 2022. And it’s entirely possible that media companies bow to the White House on this and dismantle their diversity programs, given how other companies have already caved on this front.\n\nA discussion of whether a media merger is allowed might seem a little irrelevant to people who don’t work in the field. But the diversity of the people who work for American media companies, which are responsible for distributing information and entertainment to the masses, can have a large impact on broader society.\n\nIn recent years, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, has promoted two Government Accountability Office reports that use data to make the argument that a lack of Latino representation in media has helped fuel bigoted stereotypes about the Latino community. And we’ve seen how stereotypes in media and television can afflict people of other races and religions, including Black people and Muslims, as well.\n\nIf Trump’s administration can get media companies — many of which have fallen woefully short in fostering diverse workplaces — to renounce the efforts they already have put forth to improve, we could see a media environment more hostile to racial, gender and LGBTQ-related inclusivity than any in recent memory.\n\nI’ll also note, in closing, that MSNBC could be in the administration’s crosshairs as well. The network is in the process of being spun off from its parent company, Comcast, and Trump has frequently fumed at MSNBC. Last week, he falsely called critical coverage of him on the network “illegal,” and on Friday in the Oval Office, he said he thought CNN and MSNBC are “going to be turned off,” a claim he attributed to ratings but which seemed to blur the line between an aspiration and a thinly veiled order.",

Those wounded in the shooting range from 16 to 36 years old.\n\nThe shooting occurred at around 10 p.m. in the parking lot of Young Park, police said. Las Cruces Police Chief Jeremy Story said at a news conference Saturday that the shooting resulted from a fight between two groups at an unsanctioned car show that “escalated to gunfire.”\n\n“We know that there is some type of of ill will between these groups prior to last night, so they had some issues before and it escalated last night,” he said.\n\nSeveral people were caught in the crossfire, according to the police chief. No arrests have been made, but police said they are pursuing several leads. Authorities are asking witnesses to come forward with any information and to submit any videos or photos of the shooting.\n\n“This is a huge crime scene with a lot of moving parts,” Story said.\n\nSeven of the injured were taken from local hospitals to El Paso for further treatment, Las Cruces Fire Chief Michael Daniels told reporters. Four others have been treated and released. Authorities said they were awaiting a status update on the rest of the injured patients.\n\nMore than one firearm was used in the shooting, Story said, adding that they had found dozens of handgun-caliber casings in the parking lot and throughout the park.\n\nLas Cruces city council member and Mayor Pro Tem Johana Bencomo called the shooting “a heinous act of violence” in a post on Instagram on Saturday morning. “Part of me wanted to write that this is something you never really think this is going to happen in your city, but that actually feels deeply untrue,” Bencomo wrote. “Honestly now days a tragedy like this feels like a nightmare just waiting to come true at any possible moment.”",

        "content": "Earlier this week, Suzanne Collins added another book to her literary pantheon, a prequel to “The Hunger Games” called “Sunrise on the Reaping.” Nearly two decades after the original trilogy was published, “Sunrise on the Reaping” proves how critical and timely the series remains.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” reads like it is aware of its impact and its audience. Collins’ writing is as lyrical and engrossing as it was when “The Hunger Games” debuted 17 years ago; the difference is this new book is born into an already existing cultural dominion. Collins has always had something to say, but in the context of President Donald Trump’s America, one closer to the world of “The Hunger Games” than ever before, her message is salient.\n\nCollins has always had something to say, but in the context of President Donald Trump’s America, one closer to the world of “The Hunger Games” than ever before, her message is salient.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” centers on Haymitch Abernathy, a complex and misunderstood alcoholic who appears in the original trilogy as Katniss Everdeen’s initially begrudging and then devoted coach and mentor. Collins capitalizes on the familiarity most readers will have with Haymitch’s character to craft a story that deftly examines the power of propaganda and the early stages of authoritarian rule.\n\n“Sunrise on the Reaping” is Collins’ second prequel. The first, “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,” chronicles President Coriolanus Snow’s journey to becoming the fascist leader of Panem, Collins’ dystopian reimagining of North America. Read together, the two novels illustrate how fascism takes shape: You need the right person and the right environment.\n\nThere are certain elements, structurally and stylistically, that all five books share. Collins breaks her novels into three equal parts, with the same number of chapters. In a rare interview this week with Scholastic’s David Levithan, Collins explained, “I began as a playwright over forty years ago, and that dramatic structure became the template for the novels. … I know certain things I want to achieve by certain points in the story. If I haven’t achieved them, something isn’t working the way I hoped, and I probably need to pause and figure out why.”\n\nStylistically, “The Hunger Games” series makes its reader culpable in the grotesque deaths of tributes, of children. Collins masterfully writes these scenes to be fast-paced, engrossing and detailed. You like reading them. You enjoy the horrifying brutality of the Hunger Games. In this way, the reader is complicit — just as complicit as the series’ wealthy citizens of The Capitol, who watch from safe perches in colorful outfits. Collins also grounds the novel with numerous literary references: Haymitch remembers a William Blake poem, Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven” is repeated again and again, we have a character named for Emperor Caligula’s horse, and the book opens with four quotes including a reflection from George Orwell.\n\nCollins has a knack for eliciting emotion. Readers across the country posted photos of their tear-streaked faces and puffy eyes on social media after finishing “Sunrise on the Reaping.”\n\nIn 17 years, Collins has created a brutal, grisly and heart-wrenching world that has gripped a generation of readers. Like Margaret Atwood and George Orwell before her, Collins’ novels have become part of the lexicon, an adjective — this is very Hunger Games — used to illustrate government overreach and authoritarianism. “The Hunger Games” series, including “Sunrise on the Reaping,” is a central part in the American dystopian literary canon. Dystopian literature doesn’t look like any one overarching government, environmental catastrophe or mechanism for control. What it all shares is a worst-case-scenario examination that is thought-provoking and engrossing, especially for young readers.\n\nLike Margaret Atwood and George Orwell before her, Collins’ novels have become part of the lexicon.\n\nYoung adult dystopian novels are hugely popular. The runaway success of “The Hunger Games,” with a megahit movie franchise and more than 100 million copies in print, proves that. At a recent meeting of MSNBC’s the Velshi Banned Book Club, Lois Lowry, author of one of the first young adult dystopian novels to captivate the nation, “The Giver,” attributes the success of the genre — and its widespread bans and removals — to the young protagonists. In the pages of these books, it is the young hero, the underdog, who enacts societal change. “A young person has perceived the hypocrisy and corruption of the governance of the generation that has created their world,” Lowry said.\n\nThe propaganda commentary at the center of “Sunrise on the Reaping” reminded me of early August when Elon Musk reposted a popular meme that regularly circulates online: “You watched ‘The Hunger Games’ and sided with the resistance. … When it’s fiction you understand. Yet you refuse to see it when it’s the reality you’re living in. Wild.” Seventy-four million people viewed the post. Many of them reacted negatively, calling Musk, and his wealth and influence, The Capitol. This isn’t the only time men of undue and dangerous influence have twisted Collins’ story in and attempt to use it for their own benefit. If nothing else, it proves the power of literature, particularly this genre of literature, to influence and inspire. In the brutal world of Panem, the narrative must be controlled. And off the page? The narrative must be distorted.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In a Fox News interview that aired on Wednesday, Donald Trump admitted that he worries his plan to invent and distribute so-called golden visas to people willing to pay a $5 million fee could cause \"unsavory people\" to come to the United States.\n\nWhile he's argued that the \"gold visa\" proposal would spur investment in the U.S., Trump acknowledged on Fox News that there may be downsides, though he promised to kick out any immigrants if he learns of wrongdoing.\n\nIn the interview, Fox News host Laura Ingraham asked Trump if he's \"worried about any unsavory people coming in.\"\n\n“Yeah, I’m worried about unsavory — in which case we’re gonna give ‘em the money back and they get out,” Trump replied. He also said, when pressed, that the visa holders would be \"properly vetted\" but seemingly started to add a caveat. \"You know, when you're talking about a lot of people — I think it's gonna be very successful.\"\n\nTrump has proposed the gold visas as a juiced-up replacement of the EB-5 visa, which already exists to allow foreign investors to obtain a green card if they invest at least $1.05 million in the U.S. Other countries with similar \"golden passports\" include Austria, Egypt and Turkey.\n\nThe proposal came even as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, targeted legal immigrants for deportation and contracted with El Salvador to send some deportees to a notorious prison complex.\n\nIn the interview, Ingraham also asked Trump why U.S. citizenship should be on sale \"for any amount of money\" and how it fit with his \"America First\" philosophy. Trump responded that he proposed the idea because he’s “America First,” claiming without evidence that the policy might even bring as many as 1 million new immigrants.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for MSNBC, Rotimi Adeoye laid out the moral and ethical objections to the proposal:\n\nIn Trump’s vision, citizenship is no longer about building a shared national project; it is an asset reserved for those who can afford it, as it is in countries with “golden visa” programs such as Malta and Cyprus. Being American would become a high-end commodity, available only to the wealthy.\n\nCritics have been outspoken in laying out their worries about this golden visa plan. But the Fox News interview shows that even Trump is concerned that the new visas could be abused and he has no real plan to stop that.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "The year is 2009. You’re a sophomore at a big public high school in northern New Jersey. The seasons are just starting to change, you’ve got babysitting money in your black Longchamp tote, your favorite berry-pink North Face fleece jacket on, and there is a school dance with a DJ on Friday night. It’s “neon safari” themed. You pile into your friend’s navy-blue Jeep Commander — she’s borrowing it from her father — and you head down Route 17 to the Garden State Plaza mall. There is only one place to get the perfect outfit for the school dance: the fast-fashion mecca of Forever 21.\n\nIn 2025, things are a bit different. The nation’s first mainstream embrace of fast fashion, Forever 21, is expected to close some 350 U.S. stores by May 1. The embattled brand has filed for bankruptcy twice in the past six years, blaming falling sales on competition from Chinese megabrands like Shein and Temu and their staggering online inventories. According to CNBC, at its peak Forever 21 employed 43,000 people and generated more than $4 billion in annual sales.\n\nI’m morally opposed to fast fashion from an environmental, human rights and consumerism standpoint. And yet, I am nostalgic.\n\nI shouldn’t feel a thing about Forever 21 shutting its sliding glass doors for good. My shopping habits have entirely changed in the last 15 years, favoring fewer, often vintage, higher-quality items over the abundance of low-quality, cheap and trendy wares the retailer has sold for decades. I’m morally opposed to fast fashion from an environmental, human rights and consumerism standpoint. And yet, I am nostalgic. Forever 21, for its woefully disorganized racks, its inconsistent sizing and notoriously shoddy quality, represents a bygone era, a hopeful era. It wasn’t just that I was a teen with a little bit of money, an outfit in mind and a friend with a license. The nation felt like it was coming out of darkness, toward a new light. There’s a reason Gen Z is romanticizing that era: So much felt possible.Although the pejorative “fast fashion” was coined by The New York Times in 1990, it didn’t truly enter the lexicon until the proliferation of Zara some years later. I’m sure many people were critically examining just how Forever 21’s clothes could be so inexpensive, but it certainly wasn’t the retailer’s very young target demographic. Forever 21 burst onto the scene like an apparition out of the 2008 financial crisis. There was a freedom and an independence in the low prices; a parent lamenting that the clothing looked cheap and was poor quality, but which you bought on your own, was nearly a rite of passage. In hindsight, though, Forever 21 was a primer, normalizing the concept of fast fashion for very young shoppers. The expectation became on-trend pieces for very low prices all the time, everywhere. It was well understood that you might get a handful of wears out of a Forever 21 item if you were lucky. Generally, you bought a metallic bodycon skirt or a pair of jeggings with the intention of wearing them once or twice. If your new tank top disintegrated after a single wash, well, that was the price you paid.\n\nForever 21’s organizational system, which at the time seemed bizarre and illogical to me, paved the way for the aesthetics we see dominating social media and the fashion space today. The clothes we’re not grouped by item, but by trend. In 2009, for example, there would have been an entire corner brimming with fluorescent tank tops, skirts and bandage dresses perfect for the neon-themed school dance. TikTok often categorizes users’ style as a specific aesthetic in a similar way: mob wife, clean girl, balletcore. I’ve written before about how damaging the accelerated fast-fashion trend cycle is to personal style, the fashion world and the environment. And Forever 21 was at the forefront. It was there that trends were first capitalized upon and then churned out again and again, quicker and quicker. Sure, you could try on and shed different styles with no material financial risk, but with only a few looks to choose from, your creativity was already impeded. Your self-expression was limited to what was on the rolling racks spread across Forever 21’s white, high-shine floor.Forever 21 is in a hell of its own making. By creating such a rapid trend cycle, insatiable demand and low price expectations, Forever 21 simply could not keep up with the consumer habits it founded. Shein and Temu — reportedly perpetrating human rights violations against their round-the-clock factory workers and emitting millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution — simply can, for now at least.\n\nThe last time I stepped foot in a Forever 21 was 2016. I had a friend visiting me in my first New York City apartment and we needed ugly sweaters for a Christmas party. I remember being surprised at the state of the store. It wasn’t that it was kitschier, or quiet, or aimed at younger shoppers. It felt like stepping into a broken time capsule, uncanny and unsettling — even then, a time gone by.",

        "title": "Caitlin Clark's gone, but the NCAA women’s basketball tournament is overrun with talent",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "It’s hard to believe that it’s been almost a year since the women’s NCAA Tournament national championship game eclipsed the men’s national championship game for the first time in viewership, ticket sales and hype. With the 2025 women’s tournament officially starting Friday, what have we learned about the world of women’s college basketball since Iowa’s Caitlin Clark and her LSU rival, Angel Reese, left for the WNBA?\n\nSimply put, the idea that women’s college basketball couldn’t reach high levels of success without Clark was false.\n\nThe idea that women’s college basketball couldn’t reach high levels of success without Clark was false.\n\nTo be clear, there’s a lot of doubt among television executives regarding whether this year’s women’s national championship game will reach the 19 million viewers that last year’s showdown between Clark’s Iowa Hawkeyes and Kamilla Cardoso’s South Carolina Gamecocks got. It’s worth examining how the sport has done on major television networks following the departures of Clark, Reese and many of the other college players who transitioned to the pros.\n\nFor years, a catch-22 of women’s basketball has been the complaint from major networks like Fox, ABC and CBS that women’s sports doesn’t have a large enough fan base and the counter from fans that the fan base won’t grow if games aren’t televised. For so long, networks generally declined to show women’s college basketball on the most accessible television networks.\n\nHowever, as a result of the success last season, Fox, CBS and the Disney family of networks (ABC and ESPN) all broadcast more this women’s college basketball season. Fox broadcast 18 games during the 2024-25 season, including five games in prime-time Saturday night slots.\n\n“There are great stars, great brands. We’ve done more than we have done before, and we’re not alone in doing that,” Fox Sports’ president of insights and analytics, Mike Mulvihill, said.\n\nCBS broadcast this season’s Big Ten Tournament final for the second straight year. It included the third matchup of the season between Los Angeles rivals UCLA and USC, who have two superstar talents of their own. The Clark-vs.-Reese rivalry was only the beginning. I’ll come back to this.\n\nFox, CBS and the Disney family of networks (ABC and ESPN) all broadcast more this women’s college basketball season.\n\nThe Big Ten championship game drew 1.44 million viewers, and UConn vs. USC averaged 2.2 million viewers on a Fox Saturday night prime-time matchup. While there was a dip when it came to how Clark’s games did on these same networks a year before, these non-Clark games still got viewerships in the millions. That’s not nothing, and the numbers prove that viewers are drawn to other stars, too.\n\nAnd then there are ABC and ESPN. Their regular-season ratings were up 3% over last year and up 41% from the 2022-23 season. This was the most-watched women’s college basketball regular season since the season Tina Charles and Maya Moore led UConn to the national championship in 2009. There was a 120% year-over-year viewership increase in the three games televised on ABC, which averaged 1.3 million viewers a game.\n\nViewership of around 1 million people across multiple networks disproves the prediction that the women’s college game wouldn’t stay afloat after Clark and Reese left. Another sign the game is doing just fine: The average price for a 30-second commercial during this year’s women’s national championship game has more than doubled.\n\nA big reason an equal number of people, if not more, have watched women’s college basketball the season after Clark, Reese and Cardoso left is the wide array of talent teams have put on the court all season. According to ESPN Bet, there are six teams with better than 10-to-1 odds to win the national championship. Parity has been the name of the game this season.\n\nEach of those six teams has at least one generational talent who’s bound to have a successful WNBA career. Let’s begin with USC’s JuJu Watkins, a 6-2 two-way small forward who is a prolific scorer and gifted athlete. Watkins has played the tournament’s No. 1 overall seed, UCLA, and point center Lauren Betts three times and beaten them twice.\n\nBut both L.A. schools are on the same side of the bracket as UConn, which has Paige Bueckers, the 2021 National Player of the Year, who is playing in her final NCAA Tournament. With shooting guard Azzi Fudd and big wing Sarah Strong, Bueckers has more talent around her than she’s had in her entire UConn career.\n\nReese, Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Chelsea Gray made sure Unrivaled was a year-one success.\n\nWe can’t forget about Notre Dame, which has a three-headed monster in its backcourt: flashy pass-first guard Olivia Miles, defense-minded slashing guard Hannah Hidalgo and do-it-all wing Sonia Citron. But to win the championship, the Fighting Irish will have to get through Texas, led by three-level scoring point forward Madison Booker, and the defending champions, the South Carolina Gamecocks, who are arguably the deepest team in the field.\n\nThe Gamecocks don’t have a true No. 1 option, but March Madness is when superstars are born. Does speedy and shifty guard MiLaysia Fulwiley emerge as South Carolina’s unstoppable force? We’ll have to see.\n\nPeople don’t have to know that Clark is playing to watch women play basketball. The new 3-on-3 professional league Unrivaled aggressively pursued her to play in its inaugural season. She decided against it. Still, 364,000 viewers (the second most who’d ever watched an Unrivaled game), watched the first-ever championship game. Other WNBA stars, including Reese, Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Chelsea Gray made sure Unrivaled was a year-one success.\n\nIn the same way, Watkins, Bueckers, Hidalgo, Miles, Booker and Fulwiley will keep March Madness humming following the departure of Clark. The women’s basketball boom was never about one player, and now we have the numbers that prove it.",

        "title": "Trump isn't just attacking judges. Now he's attacking lawyers, too.",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Trump v. the lawyers\n\nPresident Donald Trump has escalated his attacks on the legal system to include lawyers who’ve dared to represent the other side in his legal cases, undermining a fundamental principle of the rule of law.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump signed two disturbing executive orders targeting white-shoe law firms. On Friday he announced he was rescinding one of them when the firm, Paul Weiss, agreed to provide $40 million worth of pro bono legal services to support specific White House initiatives.\n\nThe message was clear: Work for Trump’s opponents, and you’ll be punished; work for him, and you’ll be rewarded.\n\nAnd the punishment was severe. The executive orders targeting Perkins Coie and Paul Weiss stripped their lawyers of security clearances needed to work on sensitive cases, cut the firms off from all government contracts and, in some cases, even barred their attorneys from entering federal buildings. That would make it impossible for them to work for certain clients — as one already did, citing the order.\n\nTrump claimed he was enacting these sanctions because of “national security risks” and the firms’ alleged “racial bias” in hiring due to “DEI,” which are two of his favorite fabricated attack lines. But the executive orders undermined that argument when they began by rehashing old Trump complaints about the firms' political work.\n\nThe Perkins Coie order started by criticizing the firm for its work in 2016 for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, which included taking over research that became the Steele dossier, a document that contained allegations of collusion between Trump’s campaign and the Russian government. (In the order, the Trump administration claimed that the dossier was “designed to steal an election.”)\n\nThe Paul Weiss order, meanwhile, began by criticizing a partner who worked for special counsel Robert Mueller and on a case against Jan. 6 participants, and a former partner who worked on Trump’s “hush money” case in Manhattan, which resulted in his conviction on 34 felony counts. (In the order, the Trump administration claimed that \"global law firms\" played a role in \"undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles.\")\n\nWhile a lower court judge blocked the Perkins Coie order temporarily, saying it sent “chills down [her] spine,” Trump’s intimidation campaign appears to be working. Behind closed doors, some of the country’s most influential law firms are debating whether to push back publicly. Many, however, are too scared of retribution, according to five lawyers granted anonymity by Politico to speak candidly.\n\nAnd it’s not just lawyers. Judges overseeing cases tied to his agenda are receiving death threats. After Trump called for the impeachment of a federal judge who ruled against him, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare public rebuke, writing that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.” So the point is this: Trump’s threat to our judicial system goes far beyond him possibly ignoring a federal court ruling.\n\nAs the country’s first president to be tried and convicted of crimes, Trump has always had a troubled relationship with the courts. But his new strategy isn’t just about trying to win in court. It’s about terrifying the legal profession into submission. Because if he can scare the nation’s best lawyers away from taking cases opposing his interests, he can win before anyone even sets foot in a courtroom.\n\nA story you should be following: Trump’s USDA just cut $1 billion from schools and food banks\n\nFood banks across the country are already struggling to meet demand. The Trump administration has decided now is the perfect time to slash more than $1 billion in funding that helps schools and food banks purchase fresh food from local farmers.\n\nThe cuts eliminated $660 million that schools rely on to buy local produce, meat and dairy and $420 million that helped food banks stock their shelves. The U.S. Department of Agriculture claims it’s shifting toward “fiscally responsible initiatives,” but for millions of kids and families, that means less access to fresh, healthy food — and for farmers, it means losing a critical source of income.\n\nThe effects are already being felt:\n\nScottsdale Unified School District in Arizona just lost $100,000 it had planned to spend on local beef and fresh fruits and vegetables for school lunches.\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey says her state will lose $12 million in school meal funding, forcing districts to scramble to cover the shortfall.\n\nIn North Carolina, some farmers grow exclusively for food banks. As one put it, “This program is what has been keeping our family farm open.”\n\nThe consequences are clear: fewer healthy meals for kids, more struggling families turning to food banks, and small farms pushed closer to closure. Once again, much like Trump’s cuts to USAID food purchase programs, small farmers are paying the price.\n\nSomeone you should know: Idaho sixth grade history teacher Sarah Inama\n\nYou’d think a sign that says “Everyone is welcome here” wouldn’t be controversial. But in one Idaho school district, that message was deemed too political, and now a teacher is facing possible termination for refusing to take it down.\n\nSarah Inama, a sixth grade history teacher, says she put up the sign five years ago to help students know they were learning in an “open and welcoming space.” But her principal recently told her to take it down, citing a district policy that requires classrooms to “respect the rights of people to express differing opinions” and that decorations must be “content-neutral.”\n\nAn Idaho school district ordered a teacher to remove an “Everyone is welcome here” sign. Courtesy Sarah Inama\n\nConfused about how this picture is controversial? Us, too.\n\nAs Inama responded, “There are only two opinions on this sign: Everyone is welcome here, or not everyone is welcome here.” And if welcoming everyone is too controversial, that tells you exactly where we are right now.\n\nAt a time when Trump and his allies are attacking basic rights — from the courts to the classroom — it’s not easy to stand up to this pressure. But across the country, people like Inama are refusing to back down. And we should all be paying attention.",

Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger; and attorneys Mark Zaid and Norman Eisen.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, both of whom pursued criminal cases against Trump, were also on the list.\n\nAs NBC News pointed out, many of those named in Trump’s memo had already seen their clearances revoked by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard earlier this month.\n\nIn January, Trump rescinded the security clearances of 50 former intelligence officials, including his former national security adviser John Bolton. Legal experts said at the time that it amounted to an attempt to intimidate and silence those who have crossed him.\n\nTrump has more recently used the threat of pulling security clearances to bend top law firms to his will. At least one firm, Paul Weiss, gave in to that effort Thursday, eliminating its diversity policies and agreeing to provide $40 million in pro bono work for causes Trump supports in exchange for the reversal of an executive order that targeted the company.\n\nThe president has also removed security details for some of his political targets, some of whom continue to face legitimate security threats. Earlier this week, he announced he was stripping Biden’s children, Hunter and Ashley Biden, of Secret Service protection.",

        "content": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is under siege — by his own party.\n\nAfter the New York Democrat capitulated to President Donald Trump over a short-term funding bill, he’s received some pointed warnings from colleagues warning that his leadership position could be in jeopardy. An increasing number of liberal organizations are calling on Schumer to either step down from his leadership position or to fight more aggressively. Schumer even canceled events promoting his new book this week after progressive groups planned to stage protests against them.\n\nThe dissent reflects the Democratic Party’s intensifying identity crisis over how to fight back against Trump.\n\nThe dissent reflects the Democratic Party’s intensifying identity crisis over how to fight back against Trump — and a rejection of Schumer’s belief that Trump’s policy mistakes will speak for themselves. Should Schumer continue to invest in the “play dead” strategy, it could cost him his position.\n\nRep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., was the first to openly call for Schumer to step down at a town hall on Tuesday. “I respect Chuck Schumer. I think he had a great, long-standing career, did a lot of great things, but I’m afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to get a new leader,” he said. That same day, Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., responded affirmatively when asked at a town hall if she supported him stepping down. When asked if more could follow, one House Democrat told Axios, “I think there are some already there but just haven’t been asked directly or avoided the question.”\n\nSchumer’s colleagues in the Senate haven’t called on him to step down, but they’ve still been strikingly critical. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Schumer was “wrong” to cooperate with Trump. When asked at a town hall if he would call for Schumer to step down, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said: “In dodging your question, let me just say: It’s important for people to know when it’s time to go, and I think in the case of Joe Biden. And we’re going to have conversations I’m sure in the foreseeable future about all the Democratic leadership.”\n\nBennet’s invocation of Biden’s implosion should make Schumer at least a little uneasy. We’re certainly not close to the rolling wave of demands for Biden to step down from his presidential candidacy in 2024. But an idea has to start somewhere, and now it’s in the air.\n\nRecall that when the calls for Biden’s withdrawal started to pick up, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi effectively let them take their course by refusing to stand in the way and saying it was up to Biden to decide whether he wanted to remain in the race. Pelosi may be positioning herself analogously in this moment. She hasn’t come out against Schumer’s leadership position, but she also criticized him sharply this week, telling reporters that Schumer could have negotiated harder with Republicans by pushing back against spending cuts to programs like Medicaid and trying to get them to “agree to a third way.” Failing that, she argued, Democrats should have at least attempted to set Republicans up for the blame in case of a government shutdown. “I myself don’t give away anything for nothing,” she said. “I think that’s what happened the other day.”\n\nSchumer has led his party in the Senate for the better part of a decade, and he can probably withstand a lot of heat. But the pressure is on for him to change his approach to legislative fights in the coming months, including bills to raise the debt ceiling, and another government funding bill in the fall. Ultimately his leadership position is less important than what the threats to it symbolize: a desperate feeling that the party needs an overhaul.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Don’t cry for him, America, but when it comes to his vision for the Kennedy Center, President Donald J. Trump appears to be dreaming impossible dreams.\n\nThe president, who is also now the board chair for the Kennedy Center, convened a meeting of said board on Monday. In a recording of the meeting shared with The Washington Post, Trump and members said they’d like to see “Camelot,” “Cats,” “Fiddler on the Roof,” “Hello, Dolly!” and “The Phantom of the Opera” featured at the Kennedy Center. Speaking with reporters, Trump said, “We’re going to get some very good shows.”\n\nMost Kennedy Center audiences were never the sort of conservative theatergoers clamoring for a season of ‘Cats,’ ‘Phantom’ and ‘Fiddler on the Roof.’\n\nThere are a number of practical problems with this wish list, the first of which is that none of those musicals are touring in North America (although a tour of “Phantom” does launch in November). And if the Kennedy Center were to try to mount its own nonunion productions, it would run into a brick wall of standing labor contracts.\n\n“We’re gonna fix that,” the president said upon learning that the Kennedy Center would have had to pay the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees in order to have board member Lee Greenwood sing at the meeting. “They wanted $30,000 to move a piano,” Trump claimed.\n\nAnd yet, none of these obstacles prevent the president of the United States from assuming “Cats” will be onstage at the Kennedy Center next year, as if he has the power to summon Mr. Mistoffelees and Rum Tum Tugger through sheer will.\n\nSince Feb. 7, when Trump announced plans to appoint himself America’s arts impresario in chief, he has fired roughly two dozen board members appointed by President Joe Biden, had the remaining trustees elect a new president of the board and dismissed Kennedy Center leader Deborah Rutter, who had helmed the institution for 11 years.\n\nLife at the center has been a tumultuous free fall ever since, with a series of cancellations and missed deadlines. The second week of March, when the Kennedy Center typically announces programming for the next season, has come and gone. Across Washington, venues like The Anthem and Shakespeare Theatre Company are fielding calls from artists and organizations looking for somewhere else to perform. Most notably, the producers and creators of the musical theater juggernaut “Hamilton” announced they were canceling a two-month run, which most likely have generated more money than any other show in the 2025-26 Kennedy Center season.\n\n“I never liked ‘Hamilton’ very much,” the president said, undeterred.\n\nYet alleged financial mismanagement at the Kennedy Center has been top of mind for Trump and his surrogates, including Ric Grenell, the former ambassador whom the president appointed to replace Rutter on at least an interim basis, who accused the center of having low cash reserves.\n\nAs a nonprofit organization, the Kennedy Center is required to submit public tax returns, and the most recently available filings indicate it is not in financial distress, with a total budget of $268 million and a surplus of $6 million. About 16% percent of the budget comes from a congressional appropriation specifically earmarked for physical upkeep, because the center was dedicated in 1971 as a national memorial to slain President John F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nStaffers have admitted that some needed maintenance has been deferred, and regular visitors know that massive columns on the weather-beaten Potomac River side are under scaffolding for repairs. Still, the center hardly seems in need of the make-it-great-again overhaul the president claims. “It’s in tremendous disrepair, as is a lot of our country,” Trump said. His redecorating plans include “the seats, the décor, everything” and will be funded by Congress.\n\nBut in a series of recent interviews, a board member appointed during Trump’s first term has shared his own glitzed-up vision for the Kennedy Center. Among other things, New York real estate magnate Paolo Zampolli has proposed fashion shows, a Cipriani restaurant and a ramp so he can travel by boat from Georgetown instead of taking an Uber.\n\n“I see the center like La Scala of Milano,” he told Politico. “So luxurious. So prestigious.”\n\nThe center hardly seems in need of the make-it-great-again overhaul the president claims.\n\nBut Zampolli’s vision of the Kennedy Center as a hangout for Washington’s 1% sets up an odd dichotomy for the proposed audience. The average red-hat-wearing tourist who might buy tickets for “Cats” has never dreamed of eating overpriced spaghetti at Cipriani. The reality is that most Kennedy Center audiences are in the middle of these two demographics: They are federal workers who enjoy classical music, NGO lobbyists with undergraduate theater degrees and labor leaders with affinities for modern dance. And they are exactly the people now weighing whether to boycott Kennedy Center performances, because they are laid off, they are protesting Trump’s takeover or both.\n\nMore important, most Kennedy Center audiences were never the sort of conservative theatergoers clamoring for a season of “Cats,” “Phantom” and “Fiddler on the Roof.”\n\n“Those are G-rated, general audience, high school-approved shows,” Lulu Picart told me. A Broadway performer and theater artist, Picart appeared at the Kennedy Center in the 2023 touring production of the musical “1776,” which featured a cast of female, trans and nonbinary performers as America’s Founding Fathers.\n\nPicart and her cast members were appalled to wake up one February morning and discover all record of the groundbreaking performance had been scrubbed from the Kennedy Center’s website. (Ironically, the Trump administration has made artistic endeavors celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence a priority over at the National Endowment for the Arts.)\n\nThe president, in an Evita-like photo-op on Monday, stood in the Kennedy Center’s Opera House presidential box, arms outstretched as if there were hundreds of fans below him instead of a handful of handpicked board members.\n\n“It won’t be easy, you’ll think it strange,” the eponymous character Evita sang in the opening of her anthem for a new Argentina. She’s absolutely right. The changes Trump is proposing won’t be easy. And as anyone who knows show business could tell the president, it’s also very, very strange.",

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urged Fox News viewers to buy stock in the electric car company. And we’re seeing this whole-of-government effort backing the world’s richest person (and Trump’s top 2024 election donor) extend to the Department of Justice as well.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi most recently emphasized her support of Musk on Thursday, when she issued a press release headlined, “Attorney General Pamela Bondi Announces Severe Charges Against Violent Tesla Arsonists.” The release didn’t name specific defendants or charges but summarized allegations against three people she said were “responsible for the violent destruction of Tesla properties.” She said they’ll “face the full force of the law for using Molotov cocktails to set fire to Tesla cars and charging stations.”\n\nBondi said in the release that “the days of committing crimes without consequence have ended” and “if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.”\n\nOne might object that the days of consequence-free crime haven’t so much “ended” as a new administration has new criminal justice priorities, beginning with Trump’s blanket pardoning of the Jan. 6 defendants. But each administration is entitled to its priorities within the confines of the law, and the DOJ’s latest announcement helps to solidify its policy of protecting those loyal to Trump and taking punitive action against others.\n\nOn that note, Ed Martin, the president’s pick to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the nation’s capital, has likewise pledged to bring the weight of the federal law against Musk’s opponents. And just this week, Bondi retweeted Musk’s posts about her Fox News television appearance and public statement touting law enforcement action against Tesla-related defendants.\n\nPutting aside the specifics of these cases, whatever criminal actions anyone takes against people or property shouldn’t escape prosecution based on the victim’s identity. That is, Musk’s person and property are no less legally deserving of protection than anyone else’s. But given the political incentive behind bringing these cases and any other related ones, they’ll deserve close scrutiny as they develop.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "content": "“How can President Donald Trump appeal to the Supreme Court on the issue of whether a district judge can block action nationwide when I don’t believe the issue has gone through lower courts?”\n\n— Tom Morris, Richmond, Virginia\n\nHi Tom,\n\nThere are different ways that cases get to the Supreme Court. The traditional route is for an issue to be fully litigated first through the trial and appellate courts, which can take years. Then there’s the route that the Trump administration took on birthright citizenship, which lands on the court’s so-called “shadow docket” or “emergency docket,” where the justices handle preliminary or urgent matters.\n\nHere’s how that background plays out in the birthright citizenship litigation. Federal trial judges in three states (Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington) preliminarily halted Trump’s attempt to restrict birthright citizenship. The administration went to the respective federal appeals courts to try to upend those trial-court orders, lost those efforts, and then went to the Supreme Court with applications that are still pending.\n\nAs you note, the issue the administration is pressing to the high court isn’t the constitutional merits of the birthright citizenship question per se but whether judges can block a move nationwide — instead of just helping the people who brought the lawsuits in these cases. Nationwide injunctions are an issue that’s applicable across all sorts of cases and one that Republican-appointed justices have criticized; along with the merits of the birthright citizenship issue not favoring the government, that could be what made taking the nationwide injunction issue to the justices a more attractive litigation strategy for the government rather than more directly and immediately seeking to upend a long-standing constitutional protection.\n\nNotably, the justices aren’t treating the Trump administration’s applications with much urgency. Trump’s acting solicitor general filed the applications to the high court on March 13, and the justices gave the opposing parties an April 4 deadline to respond. In the context of purported emergency litigation, that’s a luxurious timeline. Whether that reflects the high court’s skepticism of the government’s underlying argument on the merits of the birthright citizenship issue, something else or some combination of factors may become more apparent in retrospect when the court ultimately rules on the government’s applications. But in light of that relatively luxurious timeline, it will likely be at least a couple more weeks until we learn more about the court’s thinking.\n\nHave any questions or comments for me? I’d love to hear from you! Please email deadlinelegal@nbcuni.com for a chance to be featured in a future newsletter.",

They saved their money and helped put my sister and me through college and provided some support for me through medical school.\n\nThat’s why I never knew that my parents weren’t ready for retirement until it was obvious they weren’t. The cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid. Even though my family’s story is extremely common, the inability to pay mounting medical bills comes as a surprise to nearly all families, because few of us face the facts of aging until we have to.\n\nThe cost of their medical issues overwhelmed them, as happens to so many older Americans who ultimately depend on Medicaid.\n\nMy mom was the glue that held our family together and kept the household running. But when she started losing her memory around 60, running everything became Dad’s responsibility, and he already had a myriad of his own health problems: diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure. My sister and I were fairly oblivious then to what was happening. I was busy working full time and raising children, and she lived halfway around the world. Like many aging parents, ours insisted that everything was OK, and they did a pretty good job covering up that it wasn’t. But given the speed of Mom’s memory decline and the severity of Dad’s chronic illnesses, they couldn’t cover things up long.\n\nThe author poses with her parents at her 2007 medical school graduation. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nThey needed more care than they could provide each other and more than home health care visits could provide. They began by transitioning to what’s called “independent living” for my dad and assisted living for my mom. Even though my parents enjoyed comfortable retirement pensions, Social Security and private insurance, their new living arrangement was barely financially feasible, and I was constantly worried about what would happen when they needed a higher level of care.\n\nThis all came to a head about two years later when exacerbations of chronic health problems landed my father in the ICU. His health deteriorated so much with this hospitalization that it became obvious that he could no longer live independently. In fact, he needed so much help that he needed full-time skilled nursing — a nursing home. And I soon realized that despite my being a physician, there was so much that I didn’t know about nursing homes. I didn’t realize, for example, that my parents’ “good” private insurance didn’t cover nursing home care. But that’s fine, I thought; Dad’s old enough for Medicare. That’s when I learned Medicare doesn’t pay for nursing homes, either.\n\nThe private pay rate for the nursing home in his “life community,” I learned when I started investigating it, was $13,000 per month! I thought that surely was a mistake or that we had somehow chosen a particularly expensive place. But, no, in 2019 in greater Milwaukee, which has a relatively low cost of living, that price was about average. Some places cost slightly less, and some cost much more, but I, a physician, didn’t find a single place we could afford. We were already paying almost $6,000 per month for my mom’s assisted living. To pay for Dad’s nursing home care on top of that would have cost $200,000 per year, more than my parents ever made when they worked full time. They certainly didn’t have that kind of money saved.\n\nMy sister and I discussed one of us quitting our jobs but realized that even if one of us did, we couldn’t provide Dad the skilled care he needed at home. And neither of us could quit our jobs and still pay all our bills. I, specifically, was in the middle of the classic sandwich generation dilemma. I had a toddler and a child in elementary school. I was trying to pay off medical school loans, pay for child care, pay the mortgage, save for my kids’ college and my own retirement. Everything was untenable. We didn’t understand how people managed these situations.\n\nThe author with her sister and her parents for Christmas 2013. Courtesy Dr. Jennifer Jury McIntoch\n\nAn amazing social worker helped me understand that most non-wealthy Americans spend down their savings and apply for Medicaid. I was floored. My parents were average Americans with decent pensions and modest savings. What need did they have for Medicaid when they had private insurance? How could skilled nursing care cost so much that most people who need it are priced out of it?! That’s when I learned that Medicaid is how the majority of America receives skilled nursing care. At the time, 2019, Medicaid was the primary payer for 59% of nursing home care. As of July 2024, that proportion had risen to 63%.\n\nWhile enrolling my father was extremely complicated, I believe the process ensures that those who apply are truly eligible. What we learned is that almost all of my father’s pension and Social Security benefits went to pay his nursing home. He got to keep $30 per month for personal items. Also, the Medicaid negotiated rate for the nursing home was much lower than the $13,000 a month I’d been quoted. This arrangement was lifesaving for my father and will be lifesaving for my mother if she ever requires this level of care. The families of many elderly Americans may never imagine they’ll need Medicaid — until they need it.\n\nRepublicans are proposing $880 billion in mandatory spending cuts in programs that fall under the purview of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A cut of that magnitude would almost certainly slash Medicaid. That would be disastrous for the hundreds of thousands of elderly Americans who live in nursing facilities. The Republicans supporting this bill most likely have or will have family members who depend on Medicaid.\n\nIt’s wrong of Congress to take an ax to the floor of the boat keeping so many Americans afloat. Slashing Medicaid would be that kind of heartless move.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump’s hometown of New York City is ground zero for his assault on blue cities and states and their institutions.\n\nThe rule of law is being replaced with the whims of the president, and so far there’s no sign that any of the Democrats running to be mayor, including damaged incumbent Eric Adams, are up to the moment of protecting the city from Trump when needed.\n\nAdams is openly compromised. The other candidates have been more interested in talking about that or taking whacks at the front-runner, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, than in articulating how they’d stand up to this presidential pressure campaign hitting the city from all sides.\n\nThe rule of law is being replaced with the whims of the president.\n\nThere’s the $400 million in federal funding being withheld from Columbia University in a legally dubious move, at least until it complies with a sweeping and nebulous series of demands. These include a crackdown on anti-Israel protests and a masking ban at the same time that masked federal agents are picking up campus members and shipping them to Louisiana for deportation proceedings.\n\nThen there’s the executive order, a true bill of attainder, that threatened to destroy Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, one of the city’s most prominent law firms, for employing and working on behalf of the president’s real and perceived enemies. Trump said Thursday he’ll drop the order after the firm’s head went to the White House, which said he apologized for “wrongdoing” and agreed to provide $40 million in legal services to Trump-favored causes over his term. (Trump should update the title of his best-known book to “The Art of the Shakedown.”)\n\nTrump also imposed the legally dubious demand to shut down New York’s already federally approved and implemented congestion pricing plan, along with blackmail about cutting other federal funding unless Gov. Kathy Hochul complies and cuts out what Trump’s transportation secretary whined Thursday is “open disrespect of the federal government” in refusing to accept its made-up ultimatum.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department is also suing the state for refusing to let the feds use its DMV database, including undocumented immigrants with state driver’s licenses, as a de facto deportation list.\n\nAnd then there are the threats from Trump’s “border czar,” Tom Homan, about how “I don’t care what the judges think, I don’t care what the left thinks, we’re coming” and Homan’s open extortion of Mayor Adams — who is desperate to get a dispensation in the criminal corruption case against him — about how “I’ll be in his office, up his butt, saying where the hell is the agreement we came to” if the mayor doesn’t deliver much more cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, never mind New York’s sanctuary city laws.\n\nAs the hits keep coming with more on the way, Adams has said he won’t publicly criticize Trump or his administration, openly humiliating himself and the city he’s supposed to lead in the process.\n\nNew York City didn’t go red in 2024 by any measure, but it got notably less blue as Trump basically matched his 2020 numbers while Kamala Harris fell short of Joe Biden’s 2020 results in every single electoral district.\n\nA message to those Democrat skeptics: You can dislike any or all campus protesters, menacing street theater, white-collar law firms, congestion pricing, blue state governors, the far left or crooked mayors and still recognize that using the power of the federal government to target real or supposed “enemies” this way is deeply disturbing.\n\nTrump should update the title of his best-known book to ‘The Art of the Shakedown.’\n\nAnd that’s before getting to the wild terror claims being thrown around by the feds without even nominal attribution and the supposed gang members being shipped, without any evidence or hearing in a frontal assault on the judiciary and the rule of law itself, to a hellhole El Salvadoran prison.\n\nIf you thought the Biden administration was committing “lawfare” and are applauding Trump’s retribution tour, your complaint was not about having an “enemies list” — just with who was on it.\n\nTrump’s extortion scheme, demanding tribute from cities and elite institutions as if they were conquered territories, is about exacting punishment, of course, but it’s largely about compliance.\n\nLop off a few heads and other people get nervous about lifting theirs up. That goes for protesters and administrators and mayors and just about everyone else. The beatings will continue until morale improves.\n\nTrump’s big idea, if “idea” isn’t too generous a word, is to take hard, wild swings and expect everyone who doesn’t get hit to race to comply before the hammer comes down again — and to get in an as many swings as he can before courts or lawmakers or anyone else can even react.\n\nThat’s why Manhattan medical giant NYU Langone is scrubbing references to its “diverse students” and the word “marginalized” from its website and policy documents and reconsidering words as harmless as “vulnerable” for fear of incurring Trump’s ire.\n\nYou don’t need to love all things DEI to recognize that executive orders criminalizing an “ideology” without even defining it are meant to coerce silence and violate what had been the bedrock American principle that the government doesn’t get to pick speech winners and losers.\n\nThat crude approach appears to be working. It’s not just NYU Langone, which was unlucky enough to have its memo leak first. Nearly every lawyer is advising the institutions they work for to tone down their language, trim their sails and hope the lightning strikes someone else.\n\nColumbia’s board is reportedly trying to figure out how to meet Trump’s terms, including placing its Middle Eastern studies department in “academic receivership” despite the damage that would do to the institution’s independence — and despite the fact that Trump hasn’t even said he’ll restore the money if it complies, only that he won’t negotiate at all until it does.\n\nNew York has talked a big game about progressive values, but those are being tested as never before.\n\nOnly a handful of other schools have called out the shakedown, reversing the famous Benjamin Franklin quip at the signing of the Declaration of Independence about how “We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.” Most everyone is keeping quiet, hoping someone else gets hung first.\n\nNew York has talked a big game about progressive values, but those are being tested as never before. The rest of the country is watching to see how America’s biggest city, and Trump’s hometown, will handle the tough years ahead as voters decide whether to put up or shut up.\n\nIf there’s a mayoral candidate willing to actually lead before voters give them the job by talking about the tough times and hard choices that are coming as the federal government cuts funding to New York City and pressures whoever’s mayor to comply with his diktats, this is the time to find out if New Yorkers are serious or not about wanting a profile in courage.",

        "content": "Republicans are very upset with the federal judiciary. As the number of injunctions against the Trump administration runs into the double digits — one of the latest indefinitely blocked Trump’s ban on transgender service members — the rage and name-calling is only getting worse.\n\n“This is tyranny. A small handful of marxist judges trying to run the entire country,” lamented Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.\n\n“District Court judges have issued RECORD numbers of national injunctions against the Trump administration,” complained Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, “a dramatic abuse of judicial authority.”\n\nIf the Trump administration wants an end to the seemingly endless adverse federal judgments against its policies, there is a relatively simple and elegant solution.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, the nation’s highest-ranking law enforcement figure, accused federal Judge James Boasberg, who blocked the recent deportation of hundreds of legal Venezuelan immigrants, of “meddling in our government.” One can assume that Bondi was absent the day her law school professors discussed the separation of powers and explained that the federal judiciary is a co-equal branch of the federal government.\n\nFor his part, Trump called Boasberg a “radical left lunatic” and demanded his impeachment — a move that led Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to publicly, albeit not directly, criticize the president.\n\nHowever, if the Trump administration wants an end to the seemingly endless adverse federal judgments against its policies, there is a relatively simple and elegant solution.\n\nSTOP BREAKING THE LAW.\n\nThe Trump administration complaining about meddlesome federal judges is like Al Capone complaining about snooping Treasury agents — or John Dillinger complaining about intruding bank guards.\n\nThere is a very easy explanation for why Trump’s policies keep getting blocked by federal judges: They are illegal.\n\nOne would think that Trump would be used to this by now. In his first term, there were 64 federal injunctions slapped on his initiatives — double the number in the George W. Bush, Obama and Biden administrations combined.\n\nRather than the endless whining about the federal judiciary, the Trump administration should call a timeout and get everyone who works in the White House and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to spend the day reading the Constitution. When they finish that bit of civic education they could search up Marbury v. Madison, the Supreme Court ruling that establishes the principle of judicial review and makes the country’s highest court the arbiter of what is and isn’t constitutional.\n\nHad White House lawyers taken the time to leaf through the country’s founding legal document, they might not have been upbraided by a federal judge who ruled that DOGE’s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development “likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.”\n\nA quick perusal of the 14th Amendment might have also prevented Trump from signing an executive order to end birthright citizenship — an order that’s been blocked by three federal judges, one of whom called the proclamation “blatantly unconstitutional.”\n\nThe greatest threat to American democracy is not federal judges who have read the Constitution and are faithfully interpreting the law.\n\nAfter Trump issued an executive order seeking to punish the law firm Perkins Coie for having previously worked with Hillary Clinton by terminating any federal contracts with the firm and barring government employees from working with its attorneys, federal Judge Beryl Howell said the edict “sends little chills down my spine.” She compared Trump’s order to a “bill of attainder,” a legislative act that declares someone guilty of a crime and mandates a punishment without a trial or due process. Trump administration lawyers could have read up about bills of attainder by reviewing Article 1, Section 9, which expressly forbids them. (Unfortunately, when the same executive order was issued against the New York-based law firm Paul Weiss, the firm wilted under pressure and pledged $40 million in pro bono work in support of Trump administration priorities.)\n\nA better understanding of federal law could have stopped the Trump administration from firing hundreds of thousands of probationary employees, a move that federal courts have repeatedly stymied — in some cases forcing federal agencies to rehire some of those who’ve been let go.\n\nThe same can be said for Trump’s efforts to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, freeze federal spending and enact a new National Institutes of Health policy ​​capping reimbursements for medical research grants. Federal judges have blocked all three initiatives.\n\nUnsurprisingly, none of this has stopped the Trump administration from continuing to issue blatantly illegal presidential edicts. Just yesterday, Trump signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, even though such an action can only be taken by Congress. If, and likely when, Trump’s latest executive order is blocked, he and his cronies will whine about the unfairness of the federal judiciary … but all of this is entirely predictable.\n\nEarlier this week, when a federal judge blocked DOGE’s efforts to dismantle USAID, Trump complained that “rogue judges … are destroying our country.” But as is so often the case with Trump and his minions, every accusation is a confession.\n\nThe greatest threat to American democracy is not federal judges who have read the Constitution and are faithfully interpreting the law. Instead it’s a rogue White House that is consistently breaking the law, acting outside its constitutional powers and then complaining that judges are treating it unfairly.\n\nIf Trump wants to stop getting slapped down by federal judges, there’s a simple solution — abide by the law.",

        "content": "NBC News reported this week that President Donald Trump’s administration is thinking about getting rid of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s division that focuses on HIV prevention and giving those responsibilities to the Department of Health and Human Services. There’s apparently another potential plan, a source told NBC News, that would cut up to $700 million from the CDC’s HIV division.\n\nAs a person who was diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 2006, I’m dreading what comes next.\n\nAs a person who was diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 2006, I’m dreading what comes next. Just how far will any of this go or end? When I was diagnosed, I was prescribed antiretrovirals, and, within months, my viral load dropped to undetectable levels. The virus has remained undetectable since then, and I am now healthy and thriving. I’ve come a long way from the opportunistic infections I was constantly dealing with at the time of my diagnosis.\n\nThen, I was barely insured and terrified that I might never recover. Within months, my insurer rescinded my health insurance policy. How was I going to pay out of pocket for the costly medications I needed to keep me alive?\n\nI soon learned about the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act. It provides HIV primary care, treatment and supportive services for low-income people living with HIV. The law provides a safety net that covers the copays for my HIV prescription, which would otherwise cost about $4,000 a month. This is stabilizing for my physical and mental health.\n\nPeople living with HIV work very hard to suppress the virus so that it cannot be detected in our blood because if the virus is undetectable, then it is “untransmittable.” That is, it cannot be passed on to others through sex. In short, treatment is everything, and treatment is prevention.\n\nKnowing we cannot expose our partners to HIV and pose no threat to others is affirming and liberating. It allows us to safely have pleasurable relationships with others and make babies.\n\nThe Trump administration has already worked to eliminate USAID and hamper PEPFAR (President Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), which is credited with saving more than 26 million lives in 55 countries since its creation in 2003. Now, the CDC may be eliminating funding for HIV prevention or incorporating it into HHS’s Ryan White program. I and others in my community are nervous for the future of HIV treatment and the future of HIV prevention.\n\nTreatment is everything, and treatment is prevention.\n\nState and local health departments and community-based nonprofits depend on the CDC’s HIV division for HIV testing, HIV education, funding for the pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, funding and technical support in public health efforts. Removing funding for this could potentially fuel new cases. PrEP, when used correctly, can stop someone from acquiring HIV during intimate encounters.\n\nShoehorning HIV prevention services into the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, which provides HIV care, could overburden the program. Resources to serve the 1.2 million people living with HIV in the U.S. are already stretched thin. Resources can be even scarcer in the Deep South, especially in its rural and urban areas.\n\nAt the same time, House Republicans seem bent on slashing Medicaid.\n\nMany low-income or disabled people living with HIV depend on Medicaid for health care.\n\nI am more concerned than ever about the unraveling of safety nets that wrap around not only people living with HIV but anyone with a chronic health condition. Some days, everything seems under threat.\n\nTrump’s flurry of executive orders against DEI pose a particular danger to people like me, a Black person and member of the LGBTQ community. Many HIV prevention and treatment programs focus on LGBTQ people (sometimes trans people in particular), Black people and women. These programs for treatment and prevention may not be in alignment with Trump’s anti-DEI agenda.\n\nUntil this week, there was not a lot of talk from leaders in the HIV-positive community about preparing people living with HIV for potential service interruptions. In their defense, they didn’t have a crystal ball to predict this, and they have received no guidance from federal funding agencies. Nevertheless, that failure to plan or consider contingencies does not help clients or patients sleep better at night.\n\nWe can see from PEPFAR the consequences of reduced services or zero funding. Millions of lives are affected and rationing of medication and care has started in Africa.\n\nWhen might we need to start to rationing medication or care in the U.S.? I could probably last a couple of months but what then? Being undetectable and healthy is great. We’re living long lives now and getting old.\n\nToo many have fought hard to get the science where it is and to get the funding where it is.\n\nEven though I am trying to remain hopeful that any reshuffling of the CDC or Ryan White will be minimal, I realize hope is not a strategy. Too many have fought hard to get the science where it is and to get the funding where it is.\n\nLast year, I traveled to the southwest corner of France and noticed that many of the road signs were turned upside down. I was told farmers did that to protest government policies they opposed.\n\nIt seems to me that now’s the time to turn some things upside down in this country and fight back. We cannot let Trump make HIV a fatal disease again.",

        "title": "Trump’s FTC firings underscore his commitment to big businesses and billionaires",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump attempted to fire the two Democratic commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission, even though he can only fire the congressionally-appointed commissioners for cause. It marks a very sudden end — at least for now — to the agency’s efforts to enforce antitrust laws and consumer protections. And it’s another sign Donald Trump is governing not on behalf of the people but for the benefit of America’s biggest and most powerful businesses and billionaires. Furthermore, if the courts uphold this action — a big if — it will endanger the independence of every government agency that is designed to be insulated from day-to-day political White House pressures.\n\nWhy Trump decided to do this is a mystery. The FTC has five members, three from the president’s political party and two from the opposition. It’s not as though the two jettisoned commissioners controlled the FTC — they represented the minority Democratic Party. Earlier this week, FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson defended the structure of the FTC on the Bloomberg podcast Odd Lots: “If you have an agency that is exceeding the law, abusing the companies that it purports to regulate, it’s helpful for markets, for courts, for litigants, for government transparency to have people in the other party pointing this out.”\n\nThis is corruption, plain and simple.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya\n\nOf course, that’s almost certainly the point of ditching the two commissioners. For decades, antitrust law was ignored and dismissed by administrations from both parties and even by those who were charged with enforcing those laws. Biden-era FTC Chair Lina Khan reinvigorated and restored antitrust law (and was reviled by billionaires and many on Wall Street as a result). Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter, the Democratic commissioners Trump wants to deep-six, are committed to her vision.\n\nUnder Khan, the FTC sued Amazon in two separate civil suits, alleging, among other things, that the company is using monopoly power over the smaller businesses that sell through their site to raise prices across the internet. The two commissioners are responsible for enforcing a privacy consent decree against X. At the same time, agency staff began strengthening internet privacy rules — something that affects platforms like Meta’s Facebook and Instagram. They were also in the early stages of attempting to bring America’s soaring pharmaceutical prices under control. And the agency is suing the country’s three largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), alleging they colluded to increase the price of insulin.\n\nAll of these FTC actions are presumably in deep jeopardy as the remaining Republican commissioners’ commitment to this agenda is tenuous at best. Trump campaigned on cracking down on PBMs, bringing down the cost of living and corralling Big Tech. These are all of huge importance to the Democratic commissioners, yet the White House claimed in their note to Bedoya and Slaughter, “Your continued service on the F.T.C. is inconsistent with my administration’s priorities.”\n\nIt’s hard to see how — unless that is, you view it in the greater context of Big Tech and Big Business warmly embracing Trump. X owner Elon Musk donated more than $250 million to get him elected, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave generously to his inauguration committee, and Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos bought the rights to a Melania Trump documentary and purchased streaming rights to all 15 seasons of \"The Apprentice,\" pouring millions upon millions of dollars directly into the Trump family coffers. All have been rewarded with White House access and, in Musk’s case, the opportunity to slash the federal government bureaucracy and fire government workers at a whim.\n\n“This is corruption, plain and simple,” Bedoya said on a Tuesday night press call. “Who does this attempt to remove us help? Because it doesn’t help regular people trying to, struggling to pay the bills and struggling to pay the rent. Who it helps is billionaires, and I think it opens the door for corruption, and for a law enforcement apparatus that is controlled not by the law, but by money.”\n\nYou shouldn’t need to love antitrust policy or the Federal Reserve to understand why this is bad.\n\nBut there’s something else possibly happening here, too. Almost a century ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to fire a Republican-appointed member of the FTC. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a president can only fire congressionally appointed agency heads for cause. Disagreement isn’t good enough. Trump’s actions are not only illegal and unlawful, but they threaten other government agencies — including, crucially from Wall Street’s perspective, the Federal Reserve. If the Supreme Court rules that Trump can jettison the FTC commissioners — yes, this is heading to court — who's to say he’ll stop there? “If I can be fired, I don’t know why Jerome Powell can’t be fired,” Slaughter said Tuesday on CNBC.\n\nYou shouldn’t need to love antitrust policy or the Federal Reserve to understand why this is bad. The politicization of regulation and policy is, by definition, destabilizing to the greater economy. Decisions that appear to be made for the benefit of favored oligarchs do not make for a healthy business environment, which demands a fair application of the rule of law. It enables a corrupt economy, where money and power flow to the very top, and the rest of us, individuals and smaller honest businesses alike, are seen as so much prey. This is what Khan, Bedoya and Slaughter attempted to stop and put in reverse.\n\nOligarchs — from either party — who are used to operating without checks on their power never want cops on the beat. We saw it during the presidential election when billionaire supporters of Kamala Harris tried to bully her into committing to ditching Khan if she won, and we saw it again earlier this year when the Trump administration attempted to destroy the Consumer Federation Protection Bureau. Now, it’s playing out at the FTC, where the Trump administration is willing to break the law to get the white-collar cops to stand down.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "As Tesla stock continues to fall and the company’s dealerships become the site of protests, Tesla owners are trading in their electric vehicles at a record rate, according to new data from Edmunds, a national car shopping website.\n\nIn the first two weeks of March, “Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in,” Reuters reported, citing data from Edmunds. That represents a 0.2% increase from Tesla trade-ins from the prior month, according to the data. Reuters adds that “March’s trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues.”\n\nThose numbers don’t bode well for a company that has suffered embarrassing setbacks in recent months. Safety regulators issued a sweeping recall of more than 46,000 Cybertrucks on Thursday — the eighth such recall since the vehicles began selling more than a year ago — because Tesla used faulty glue that can allow an exterior panel to come off. The company’s stock has also been sliding fairly steadily since the end of December, raising concerns among shareholders and employees.\n\nMusk has tried to calm those nerves internally, telling employees in an all-hands meeting Thursday to hang onto their stock despite its sinking value.\n\n“If you read the news it feels like, you know, Armageddon,” Musk said on a livestream with employees. “It’s like, I can’t walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. Like, what’s going on?\"\n\nIt’s hard to tell how directly Tesla’s woes are tied to public disdain for Musk’s haphazard shakeup of the federal bureaucracy. But Tesla owners and facilities have certainly borne the brunt of the billionaire’s unpopularity with the American public. Across the country, Tesla vehicles and charging stations have been vandalized, and its dealerships have faced protests from angry crowds.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have mobilized to protect Musk’s interests. President Donald Trump held a bizarre event on the White House South Lawn to tout Tesla vehicles. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urged Fox News viewers to buy the company’s stock — a move that seem to instantly backfire and may open Lutnick up to a congressional ethics investigation. And on Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced criminal charges against three people accused of the “violent destruction of Tesla properties” in what appear to be unrelated incidents.\n\n“Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,” Bondi said in a statement.",

        "title": "Republicans want to pretend their tax cuts are free. A new report says otherwise.",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Republicans have a trifecta, which means they’re trying to pass more expensive tax cuts that will disproportionately go to the rich.\n\nHow expensive? They’ll cost $4 trillion over the next decade and would increase upward pressure on the debt ratio by 50 percent. How disproportionate? America’s top 0.1% would get a tax cut of $278,000 while 28 million households in the bottom 80 percent would have no change in their tax bill and 14 million in the bottom 80 percent would actually have their taxes go up.\n\nIn looking for ways to extend those cuts, Republicans face two problems.\n\nWhat’s different is that, this time around, much of what they’re trying to do is currently in effect but set to expire — and Republicans are not pretending the tax cuts will pay for themselves (because they don’t). Instead — and I am not making this up — they’ve just decided to say the costs don’t count. They’re free.\n\nHow did we get here? Back in 2017, Trump and congressional Republicans enacted the Trump tax cuts. Because they used a process known as budget reconciliation — the same process they’re using now — most of those cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.\n\nIn looking for ways to extend those cuts, Republicans face two problems.\n\nFirst, the tax cuts cost $4 trillion over the 10-year budget window, and Republicans can’t even get close to finding a way to pay for them, but some of them don’t feel comfortable with adding that much to the deficit. The House GOP’s proposal attempts to offset some of the extension by kicking millions of people off Medicaid and cutting food benefits down to just $1.67 per person per meal on average. Yet deficits would still increase by around $3 trillion over the decade.\n\nThe second problem is that, in order to pass a bill under reconciliation, the bill’s costs beyond the tenth year have to be fully paid for. If Republicans want to make these tax cuts permanent, they must find a way to pay for them in the long term. Given that their conference can’t even really agree on the cuts to pay for one-third of their tax bill, getting the votes for much bigger cuts would be an enormous lift.\n\nSo, now Republicans have a new strategy: pretend the tax cuts are free. Magic!\n\nThey’re claiming that, because we’ve already been incurring the costs, continuing them shouldn’t count as a new cost. Republicans endorsing this strategy include House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who says the Trump White House favors the strategy.\n\nThe CBO’s report goes on to say that extending the Trump tax cuts would harm the economy and increase consumers’ borrowing costs.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this is an enormous gimmick. The most fundamental rule of budget scorekeeping is that all costs are always scored at some point. You can score them all up front, or you can score them again and again as you keep extending the program. But what Republicans are asking for, despite getting scored on a temporary basis in 2017 when the tax provisions were first enacted and thus getting to avoid being scored for some of the cost, is to now be scored as free to continue. That means some of the costs would never be scored. No program in the entire budget receives that treatment.\n\nBut while Republicans can pretend the costs are free, the Treasury Department will have to finance these expensive tax cuts. That means incurring new debt.\n\nOn Friday, the Congressional Budget Office released a report estimating that permanently extending the Trump tax cuts without paying for them would in fact be very costly. The national debt “would reach 214 percent of GDP in 2054, 47 percentage points higher” than if the tax cuts aren’t extended. The CBO’s report goes on to say that extending the Trump tax cuts would harm the economy and increase consumers’ borrowing costs.\n\nFor the moment, the scoring method used isn’t entirely in Republicans’ hands. The Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s expert on procedure and precedents, advises on whether bills meet the rules for reconciliation, and she is unlikely to let Republicans pretend their tax cuts are free.\n\nWe’ll likely know the parliamentarian’s answer within the next few weeks. If, as expected, she says no, Republicans have four options: accept her ruling, fire her, ignore her or vote on whether to overrule her — which would require only a simple majority. Depending on their choice, we’ll know whether Republicans will use make-believe to protect the wealthiest Americans, or whether we’ll remain tethered to reality.",

        "title": "Trump’s Justice Department seeks to shield president in Jan. 6 civil cases",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "In the recent past, there was reason to believe Donald Trump might face criminal accountability for Jan. 6 and his actions after his 2020 defeat. Those hopes were dashed, however, by the results of the 2024 election and the demise of former special counsel Jack Smith’s case against the president.\n\nThere is, however, another potential avenue for accountability — a series of civil lawsuits filed against Trump — though as The New York Times reported, the Justice Department appears to be taking steps to derail this option, too.\n\nThe Justice Department made an unusual effort on Thursday to short-circuit a series of civil lawsuits seeking to hold President Trump accountable for his supporters’ attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Department lawyers argued in court papers filed to the judge overseeing the cases that Mr. Trump was acting in his official capacity as president on Jan. 6 and so the federal government itself should take his place as the defendant. That move, if successful, could protect Mr. Trump from having to face judgment for his role in the Capitol attack and from having to pay financial damages if he were found liable.\n\nThe Times’ report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, added that the legal maneuver appeared to be the latest effort to use the powers of the Justice Department to Trump’s advantage “by effectively having himself removed from the lawsuits.”\n\nFor those who might benefit from a refresher, in the aftermath of the insurrectionist violence, among those who filed lawsuits against Trump were police officers injured during the insurrectionist violence. In fact, multiple cases were filed:\n\nIn March 2021, two Capitol Police officers, James Blassingame and Sidney Hemby, sued Trump, claiming he was liable for the injuries they suffered during the riot.\n\nIn August 2021, seven more police officers who were attacked and beaten during the Capitol riot sued the former president.\n\nIn January 2022, three more police officers — including two who aided the evacuation of lawmakers — sued Trump, seeking damages for their physical and emotional injuries.\n\nIn January 2023, the longtime partner of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died after the Jan. 6 riot, filed a wrongful death civil suit against Trump.\n\nThose civil cases have since been consolidated and are pending before U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta.\n\nTo be sure, even if Trump were to lose the civil suits, there would be no criminal consequences, but they could prove to be politically embarrassing and financially costly. Indeed, let’s not forget that he has suffered several major legal setbacks and defeats in recent years — the E. Jean Carroll case, the Trump Organization’s fraud case, the demise of his fraudulent charity, the demise of his fraudulent “university,” et al. — and those were all civil cases.\n\nWhat’s more, while the Justice Department has a policy prohibiting federal criminal charges against a sitting president, the Supreme Court has already ruled that sitting presidents can face civil suits while in office, and claims from Trump’s lawyers that he’s immune in these cases have already been rejected by two courts.\n\nIt’s against this backdrop that the Justice Department decided to intervene. The Times’ report added, “The department has argued that under the law federal officials acting within the scope of their office or employment cannot be sued personally, and that in such instances the government is the only entity that can be targeted.”\n\nIt’s an argument rooted in the idea that those who claim to have been harmed by the president’s actions on Jan. 6 should be able to sue the federal government, but shouldn’t be able to sue the Republican directly.\n\nWill this work? Watch this space.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student who was arrested and detained because of his pro-Palestinian activism, is scheduled to return to court next month in his battle with the Trump administration over his possible deportation.\n\nHis case has become a test of President Donald Trump's pledge to combat antisemitism and deport noncitizen college activists who the Department of Homeland Security said “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York ruled Wednesday that Khalil’s legal challenge to his detention should proceed in federal court in New Jersey, where he was briefly held when his attorneys filed a petition alleging his arrest and detention violated his right to due process and his First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nFurman said his order blocking the government from deporting Khalil will remain in effect as the case proceeds.\n\nKhalil, 30, who holds a green card granting him permanent residency in the U.S., is being held at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, more than 1,000 miles from his home in New York City. His legal team is trying to get him released.\n\nKhalil has a separate deportation case in Louisiana, where he appeared for a brief court hearing Friday as his lawyers challenged his arrest and detention, arguing the government’s decision to send him away to the remote facility in Jena, Louisiana, impeded their ability to represent him.\n\n“We are ready to fight just as hard for Mr. Khalil in the district of New Jersey,” said Amy Greer, a lawyer for Khalil. “He was taken by plainclothes federal agents, transferred in the middle of the night across state lines, and has been detained for over a week now, all because of his advocacy for Palestinian freedom.”\n\nHis lawyers have also said that Khalil should be released because he and his wife, Noor Abdalla, a U.S. citizen, are awaiting the birth of their first child next month. Khalil is an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent.\n\nThe Trump administration said Khalil was moved to Louisiana because detention centers in the Northeast are overcrowded and there was a bedbug infestation at the New Jersey detention center where he was held after he was arrested March 8 outside his apartment.\n\nKhalil said in a court declaration on Monday that when he was at the detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, for a night, he “did not hear anyone mention bedbugs.” He also said it appeared that other people processed at the site around the same time as he was were allowed to remain in New Jersey.The Trump administration argues that Khalil should be deported under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows noncitizens to be deported if the secretary of state determines their presence in the United States could adversely affect foreign policy.\n\nKhalil is not facing any publicly known criminal charges.\n\n“It’s almost unprecedented to invoke a provision like this,” said Marc Van Der Hout, one of Khalil’s attorneys. “The government is clearly going after him because they don’t like what he says about what’s going on in the Middle East.”\n\nPeople protest the arrest and detention of Mahmoud Khalil at a demonstration in New York City on March 12. Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images\n\nAt Friday’s hearing in immigration court in Louisiana, Khalil’s legal team was allowed more time to review the case before both parties return on April 8. Van Der Hout attended the hearing via video conference.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has said Khalil “led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on March 11 that Khalil organized protests that disrupted the campus, harassed Jewish students and distributed pro-Hamas propaganda.\n\nSamah Sisay, another lawyer for Khalil, denied the Trump administration’s claims, saying there is no evidence he provided support of any kind to a terrorist organization.\n\nSisay told NBC News on Monday that regardless of where the case challenging his arrest will play out, “our ultimate goal is to get our client out” and to continue fighting for Khalil’s release.\n\n“Every day that Khalil is in detention is justice denied,” Sisay said. “He should not continue to be punished for the government’s unlawful action. He can be released while fighting this.”\n\nSisay said Khalil’s continued incarceration could also have major health risks for his wife’s pregnancy with the “immense stress that’s being put on her.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s sweeping federal layoffs aren’t just wreaking havoc on tens of thousands of employees across the country.\n\nLawmakers in both parties are warning the cuts will harm the government’s ability to recruit young people out of college — as well as highly skilled candidates from the private sector — causing a ripple effect that could be felt for years or even decades.\n\n“The recruiting challenge they’re creating for themselves is enormous,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., whose state is home to hundreds of thousands of federal workers, said of the Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts. “I don’t think that’s an accidental byproduct. I think that’s a known consequence — and they don’t care.”\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., whose state also borders Washington, D.C., and is home to thousands of federal employees, agreed with Kaine that DOGE’s headline-grabbing, scorched-earth approach is designed, in part, to drive away the next generation of civil servants.\n\n“I’m very worried that this will discourage talented young people from joining the federal service,” Van Hollen, the son of two former federal workers, said in an interview. “A lot of people who join the federal service do it for all the right reasons; they’re patriots and they want to serve the country. And with the Musk-Trump approach, they’re effectively terrorizing the federal civil service.”\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said he, too, had concerns about the impact of cuts on recruitment efforts. A rare Republican voice on Capitol Hill who has questioned DOGE’s hard-charging approach, Bacon told NBC News: “DOGE has been good for showing where our money is being spent and some of the stupid projects that were funded. But it has been too rash in the firings. Better analysis needed to be done. It’s not efficient to fire someone and then rehire.”\n\n“There’s an old saying I learned. Measure twice, cut once,” Bacon said.\n\nFor many young people, particularly those attending college in and around the nation’s capital, DOGE has been a live-fire exercise.\n\nOne student at Georgetown University was hoping that her current internship at a federal agency would help her secure a full-time job there before she graduates in May. She found her work in the sciences rewarding and her co-workers “brilliant” and inspiring.\n\nBut in just two short months, the DOGE cuts and federal hiring freeze have upended her career plans. The student, who requested anonymity because she wasn’t authorized to speak to the media, told NBC News she’s now putting her dreams of working in government on hold and making a pivot to the private sector.\n\n“I loved the work that I did so much and I could feel like it had a tangible impact on real people that I decided that I really wanted to work in the federal government,” said the student, who asked that her name not be used and her agency not be identified.\n\nBut she acknowledged: “The federal option isn’t there. I mean, I’m still holding out a little bit of hope for the federal hiring freeze to end in April, but I know that is probably not realistic.”\n\n“I was really trying to not follow the consulting, private-sector track of most Georgetown students, and I really thought the best way to do that was to go into the public sector,” the student continued. “But now I’m thinking, I’m probably just going to try to pivot into consulting, even though it’s kind of late, or do tech.”\n\n'Traumatically affected'\n\nBoth Kaine and Van Hollen pointed to a 2023 speech by Russ Vought, now the head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), where he said of federal bureaucrats that the goal of a second Trump administration would be to “put them in trauma.”\n\n“We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,” Vought said in a video of the speech obtained by ProPublica. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.”\n\n“Russ Vought was quite open about it,” said Van Hollen, who added: “Unfortunately, this will have a huge dampening effect on the ability to recruit.”\n\nAsked about lawmakers’ concerns about the government’s ability to attract talented applicants in the future, White House spokesperson Liz Huston focused on the Cabinet members and other political appointees whom Trump has installed over the past two months.\n\n“Never before in history has an administration hired such a huge number of qualified, capable, and America-first Patriots in such little time,” Huston said in a statement. “We’ve broken records by selecting over 2,000 appointees in less than 2 months including incredible MAGA warriors like Russ Vought, Tom Homan, Sean Parnell, Harmeet Dhillon, Kash Patel, Kari Lake, Brent Bozell, and Jay Bhattacharya.”\n\nOn Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also touted the Trump administration’s “successful” efforts to fill political jobs. She said 281 Trump appointees had been confirmed by the Senate so far, with another 280 in the process. And Leavitt said the administration had filled “100%” of the political slots at the White House, the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration.\n\nStill, those political appointees are a just a small slice of the 3 million-plus federal workforce. The overwhelming number of workers are career civil servants who traditionally remain in their jobs regardless of which party controls the White House.\n\nIn addition to slashing agencies, Trump is also shutting down critical pipelines to federal careers. Started nearly a half century ago, the Presidential Management Fellows Program pairs current or recent graduate students with opportunities in the federal government, from the U.S. Agency for International Development to the National Forest Service.\n\nBut on Feb. 19, Trump signed an executive order to “promptly terminate” the competitive leadership development program, and its “talent management system” is set to be “decommissioned” at the end of this week, according to a message on the Office of Personnel Management website.\n\n“It’s a federal governmentwide program that really draws very talented people into the federal government,” Van Hollen said of the fellows program. “So I guess they don’t want young people serving the country. I mean, that’s the message they’re sending.”\n\n'They're telling them to pound sand'\n\nArati Prabhakar, who served as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Biden administration, said the DOGE cuts are telling young people and those with highly skilled, technical backgrounds to “pound sand.”\n\n“It’s a terrible message,” she said in a phone interview.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Prabhakar led the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the research and development arm of the Defense Department. And she said a big part of her job was recruiting people from universities or from the private sector, where they were offered “much higher salaries.”\n\n“But we got them, and they came in and they did great things. And the reason that they came is that the work was so exciting. … They have the ability at places like DARPA to address problems at scale. It was a place you could do big things, and you could do it for our country,” she said. “It takes so much nurturing to find those few people, and then they make such a difference, and that’s what’s being disrupted. So, we’ve got to get back on track.”\n\nPrabhakar, now living in Silicon Valley, said she recently reconnected with a Stanford University student who had been her former intern in the White House.\n\n“She’s about to finish up in computer science, and what she wants to do is to bring this incredible AI expertise that she has into public service, and she even has an offer, but she doesn’t know if it’s going to stick in this current environment,” Prabhakar explained.\n\n“And you know what DOGE’s actions are doing? Those actions are telling these immensely talented people who want to serve our country — they’re telling them to pound sand,” she said. “It’s the opposite of what we should be doing ... to draw them in.”",

        "content": "Retailers typically host their biggest sales of the season during long holiday weekends, but you don’t have to wait until the next one to shop for deals. Many of our favorite spring sales are just days away, like Amazon’s Big Spring Sale, Walmart’s Super Savings Week and Target Circle Week. Others, like Ulta’s 21 Days of Beauty and Wayfair’s Spring Cyber Week, have already begun.\n\nKnowing what to buy and skip is essential to saving during spring sales, especially if you’re tightening your budget due to tariffs and inflation. I’ve been covering sales for five years at NBC Select, so I compiled this shopping guide to help you prepare and consulted experts about their top tips.\n\nSKIP AHEAD The best spring sales to shop | What to buy | What to skip | Is shopping spring sales worth it? | How to save the most during spring sales | Why trust NBC Select?\n\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nThe best spring sales to shop\n\nHere are a few of the biggest spring sales you should have on your radar, some of which are only open to loyalty members. To stay updated about them, I recommend signing up for retailers’ SMS and email lists — that’s how they’ll notify you about new discounts, limited-time promos and extended offers.\n\nWhat to buy during spring sales\n\nMost spring sales focus on helping you prepare for the season ahead, so the best deals are on products you’ll need for the warm weather, says Stephanie Carls, a retail insights expert at RetailMeNot.\n\nSpring clothes and footwear : “Expect sales on spring apparel for men, women and children to overlap with winter clearance,” says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty. Brands often discount this season’s styles by about 10% to 30%, and drop prices on season’s styles even more to move them off shelves. Porwal specifically recommends looking for deals on running shoes and spring activewear.\n\n: “Expect sales on spring apparel for men, women and children to overlap with winter clearance,” says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty.

Porwal specifically recommends looking for deals on running shoes and spring activewear. Spring cleaning supplies : 52% of shoppers plan on spring cleaning this season, according to a recent survey by RetailMeNot — if you’re one of them, you’ll find lots of cleaning and home improvement supplies on sale across retailers. Look for discounts on sprays and scrubs, vacuums and steam cleaners, as well as products to refresh the look of your home, like area rugs, window treatments and bedding, says Porwal.\n\n: 52% of shoppers plan on spring cleaning this season, according to a recent survey by RetailMeNot — if you’re one of them, you’ll find lots of cleaning and home improvement supplies on sale across retailers.

Gardening tools : This is the best time of year to save on anything garden-related, like plants, lawn seeds, bulbs, pots, raised beds, mulch, fertilizer and tools, says Carls. You’ll also see deals on patio furniture and outdoor lighting.\n\n: This is the best time of year to save on anything garden-related, like plants, lawn seeds, bulbs, pots, raised beds, mulch, fertilizer and tools, says Carls. You’ll also see deals on patio furniture and outdoor lighting. Beauty and skin care: “Many retailers in the beauty and skin care world have sales at this time of year as new scents and products come out for the spring and summer seasons,” says Carls.\n\nWhat to skip during spring sales\n\nIt’s tempting to start browsing grills, pool supplies, bathing suits, sandals, fans and air conditioners as soon as it’s consistently sunny, but don’t stock up on these summer-related products just yet. Retailers are just starting to sell the newest models, so you won’t see strong discounts on them until the middle to end of summer, says Carls.\n\nUnlike three-day holiday weekends, the spring sales happening now are not a lucrative time to shop for big-ticket home items like appliances, mattresses and furniture, says Porwal. If you have those products on your wish list, wait to buy them until Memorial Day sales start toward the end of May. You also won’t see great tech deals during spring sales, says Carls. Hold off on adding TVs, speakers, computers, tablets and headphones to your cart until Amazon Prime Day, which is typically in July, and back-to-school sales.\n\nIs shopping spring sales worth it?\n\nAll the experts I spoke to agree that shopping spring sales is worth it for two main reasons:\n\nThe next time you’ll see site- and store-wide sales from tons of retailers is Memorial Day (May 26), which is about two months away. Spring sales are your best opportunity to save on products across categories until then. Tariffs and inflation are putting economic pressure on households, especially because the prices of essential items like groceries keep rising. This is chipping away at people’s ability to send on non-essential goods and services, causing them to have an overall negative outlook on the economy, says Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo. In fact, 49% of Americans opt to buy less amid recent tariff news, according to a recent survey by Smarty. That’s why shopping spring sales are so beneficial — it helps you buy what’s on your wishlist, be it essential or non-essential, while being budget-conscious.\n\nHow to save the most during spring sales\n\nKnowing what to buy and skip is only one aspect of strategic shopping. To get the most out of spring sales, follow the tips below, too.\n\nSign up for email lists or SMS programs to stay updated about your favorite brands’ and retailers’ spring sales. They use these platforms to contact shoppers quickly, and some offer exclusive discount codes.\n\nEnroll in loyalty programs like Amazon Prime, Walmart+ and Target Circle if you want to take advantage of member-exclusive deals. Some loyalty programs offer free memberships, too.\n\nCompare prices on items across similar retailers to ensure you’re getting the lowest price possible. “Anytime you have pretty much all retailers throwing sales, you want to check out the competition’s price before you buy,” says Carls. “In addition to price tags, look at shipping fees and promo codes. If another retailer has a promo code that gets you an additional 10% off, or includes the item you want in a buy one, get one offer, you’ll be glad you checked.”\n\nActivate cash-back offers so you can get refunded for a percentage of your spending.\n\nConsider paying with a credit card, especially for larger items, so you can earn points or take advantage of other special offers.\n\nMeet our experts\n\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts with specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience. We also ensure that all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and without undisclosed financial conflicts of interest.\n\nStephanie Carls is a retail insights expert at RetailMeNot, a deal-finding and cash-back site.\n\nis a retail insights expert at RetailMeNot, a deal-finding and cash-back site.

        "title": "Kennedy praises cellphone bans in schools, citing mix of science and misinformation",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took aim at a new target this week as part of his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda: cellphones in schools.\n\nIn an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Thursday, Kennedy praised cellphone restrictions in schools and listed health hazards that he said were linked to phone use among children and teens — some backed by scientific research, others less so.\n\nKennedy cited established links between social media use and depression and poor school performance. But he also suggested that cellphones “produce electromagnetic radiation, which has been shown to do neurological damage to kids when it’s around them all day, and to cause cellular damage and even cancer.”\n\nStudies have found that excessive use of social media via smartphones can negatively impact teens’ mental health, elevating their risk of depression and anxiety. Scientists have also long understood that cellphone use in school can lead to poor academic performance, including lower grades.\n\nHowever, the bulk of research so far has found no association between cellphone use and cancer, nor evidence that cellphones damage DNA. Cellphones emit radio frequency radiation, which has far less energy than ionizing radiation, such as that released by medical X-rays.\n\nKennedy’s statements follow a pattern of his, in which he mixes misinformation with scientific fact. Some of the issues he has highlighted during his first five-plus weeks in office, such as reducing chronic disease in children and warning of the dangers of ultraprocessed food, have broad support among the public and many scientists. But certain factors Kennedy blames for those problems and some of his proposed solutions — such as substituting beef tallow for seed oils in fast food — are not backed by research.\n\nSo, too, for cellphones in schools. Restricting their use is an issue leaders have embraced on both sides of the aisle. Last year, Vivek Murthy, then the surgeon general in the Biden administration, called on schools to get rid of phones in the classroom. Nine states have already enacted such bans or restrictions, and 15 states and Washington, D.C., have introduced legislation to do so, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank.\n\n“Both in red states and blue states, there’s a lot of concern about kids and cellphones, so I do think that there is bipartisan support on this,” said Annette Campbell Anderson, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools.\n\nHowever, there’s no reason to fear a cancer risk from using your cellphone at this time, said Jerrold Bushberg, a clinical professor of radiation oncology at the University of California, Davis.\n\n“There’s a lot of low-quality research in the literature that, if you wanted to collect all that and put it together, it would look very damning,” he said. “There are many activist groups out there that promote those studies and say that that’s the truth.”\n\nAn HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhat Kennedy says, and what studies say\n\nKennedy has made repeated, unsubstantiated claims about the physical harms of cellphone use in the past, including on Joe Rogan’s podcast last year.\n\nAt his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy also told Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., that he stood by his past statements that Wi-Fi radiation causes cancer, saying that he had “won a case in front of the Court of Appeals against the FCC on that very issue.”\n\nThe anti-vaccine group that Kennedy founded, Children’s Health Defense, challenged the Federal Communications Commission’s decision not to review its 1996 health and safety guidelines for wireless-based technologies. An appeals court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered the FCC to explain how its guidelines protect against potentially harmful health effects. However, that case was about health issues unrelated to cancer, and the court did not take a position on the potential health effects of cellphone radiation.\n\nResearch thus far has been “very reassuring” about cellphone safety, Bushberg said.\n\nMost studies have examined whether exposure to radiation from cellphones could increase the risk of brain tumors, given that people often hold their phone by their head while talking. But overall brain cancer rates haven’t risen as cellphones have become more widely used. And a large study among children found no association between wireless phone use and brain tumors.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration — agencies that Kennedy now oversees — as well as the Environmental Protection Agency have all said there’s not enough scientific evidence to associate cellphone use with cancer. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency radiation as possibly carcinogenic, meaning it cannot rule out a causal link.\n\nSeveral questions remain, said David McCormick, a biology professor at Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\n“I think it’s fairly clear that Mr. Kennedy doesn’t necessarily pay much attention to the bulk of the scientific data that is out there. That said, it’s not impossible that there are health effects from people using cellphones,” he said.\n\nIn a 2017 study, McCormick and his fellow researchers exposed rodents to radio frequency radiation and found a possible increased rate of certain tumors. However, findings in lab animals don’t necessarily apply to humans, given the many biological differences, and the studies contained limitations that prevented the researchers from drawing conclusions.\n\nA decade earlier, a study looked at cellphone use among more than 5,000 people with brain tumors and found a possible increased risk of tumors in the 10% who used their phones the most. But the research relied on people’s memories about past phone use, which aren’t always reliable, so its results (like those of similar studies) are hard to interpret.\n\nCellphone use has also changed in recent years, McCormick said, which could affect exposure. Whereas studies thus far have mainly looked at the effects of 2G or 3G mobile signals, higher-frequency 5G networks are common today. And people now text as much if not more than they call, so there’s potentially less radiation near the brain.\n\nThe pros and cons of cellphone bans\n\nDespite bipartisan support for cellphone restrictions in schools, plenty of disagreement persists as to precisely what those rules should look like.\n\nPhones can have lifesaving benefits — for instance, by allowing children to call 911 — so some parents worry that outright bans could jeopardize their child’s safety. Anderson said policymakers have to weigh those concerns against risks to kids’ mental health and their ability to focus in the classroom.\n\n“Part of what schools are trying to do is figure out how to wrest back control over what happened in their school climates because of the phone — everything from using the phone to tape fights and incidents that happen in schools to kids using them to make TikToks,” she said.\n\nThe right approach likely differs from school to school, she added. For instance, in schools where cellphones are the only internet-connected device, a ban may make less sense.\n\nIn his interview on Thursday, Kennedy applauded Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who last year issued an executive order directing the state’s education department to draft guidance for public schools to restrict or eliminate phone use and set aside $500,000 to fund those efforts. On Monday, Kennedy visited a Virginia high school that adopted the change, which he said students and teachers there have welcomed.\n\n“The states that are doing this have found that it is a much healthier environment when kids are not using cellphones in schools,” Kennedy said.\n\nHowever, prior to becoming HHS secretary, Kennedy suggested that although he personally supports getting phones out of schools, parents and teachers should make their own decisions.\n\n“Do we really want the government to decide when, where, and how we communicate?” he wrote on X in 2023.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "After Donald Trump won the presidency again, Rebecca Carlson was counting on this being the year things turned around for her 1,300-acre farm in northern Michigan.\n\nThe farm has been in her family for generations but has struggled over the past several years amid the rising cost of fuel, fertilizer and other operating expenses. Then, last year, bad weather wiped out much of her crop. But the return of Trump, she thought, would help reverse things.\n\n“I was expecting to see a drastic turnaround for the better for my farm because the Republicans have always been for the American farmer,” said Carlson, a longtime Republican and Trump supporter.\n\nPrices for cherries, her main crop, had increased during Trump's first term after his policies cut down on competition from overseas, and she was hoping to see a similar economic boost this time around. Instead, her farm has been caught up in the widespread government funding freezes, jeopardizing her ability to hire the workers she needs for this season's harvest. It could leave her $200,000 in debt if she's unable to access the grant money that had been awarded to her farm.\n\n“I’ll admit to you, I bleed Republican. However, this has left a sour taste in my mouth,” Carlson said. “During Trump’s first administration, a lot of farmers — not all, but a lot of farmers — saw the positive side to his tariffs and to his agricultural dealings.\"\n\n\"Now, we’re not seeing that,\" she said. \"Now, we’re seeing the actual opposite.”\n\nVoters in rural and agriculture-reliant areas have been one of Trump’s most consistent bases of support since he first emerged on the political scene a decade ago. But the early days of his second administration have introduced a lot of risk to this sector of the economy. Trump's proposed tariffs could drive up the price of grain and fertilizers while lowering demand overseas for U.S. agriculture products. Immigration crackdowns could cripple farm workforces, where an estimated 40% of workers lack the proper documentation to work in the U.S. Meanwhile, spending cuts and freezes have directly affected federally funded programs that provide loans and grants to farmers.\n\nTrump has acknowledged his support from farmers and talked about how his policies would benefit them by reducing imports of food from abroad, which could increase demand for some U.S.-grown products.\n\n“Our new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer — I love the farmer,” Trump said during his address to Congress this month.\n\nBut Trump acknowledged that there will be “an adjustment period” as his policies take shape. The president added that farmers will “probably have to bear with me again” as they did during his first term, when the tariffs he put in place on China resulted in retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. agriculture products, causing U.S. exports to China to tumble.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on Friday that the department was looking into program to help \"mitigate any economic catastrophes that could happen to some of our farmers.\" Asked whether that would include direct payments, Rollins said, \"We're working that out right now.\"\n\nWhile the situation with tariffs moves forward, Carlson says she doesn’t have much time to wait to solve her problems. Her farm had been awarded a grant worth $400,000 through the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help pay for the costs associated with hiring seasonal workers from overseas through the H-2A visa program, which farmers have used for years to hire temporary agricultural workers.\n\nThe USDA describes the program on its website as a way to address labor shortages on American farms and reduce illegal immigration. It's backed by $65 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan, a Covid stimulus bill passed in 2021.\n\nBut now, funding for that program appears to be frozen. Farmers like Carlson have been unable to get reimbursed for expenses they’ve already incurred under the grant, and there has been no official guidance from the USDA on whether they will get reimbursed for future expenses, said Michael Marsh, head of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, a trade group that works with the many farmers using the H-2A visa program.\n\n“It’s kind of like have the rug pulled out from underneath you,” Marsh said.\n\nThat’s left farmers having to borrow money while they wait to be reimbursed for expenses they've already paid for under the grant. And it means they are uncertain on whether to move forward with taking on the additional cost of hiring workers from overseas, Marsh said.\n\n“We’re getting right in the middle of the busy season where we’re either planting crops or pruning vines and trees, where we really need the workers here,” said Marsh. “But now, you’re out the money that you’ve been planning on being there for you.”\n\nThe Department of Agriculture didn’t respond to a request for comment about the status of the funding.\n\nFarmers aren’t alone in feeling the effects of sweeping cuts and funding freezes across the government, many of which are at the center of court fights. Shortly after taking office, Trump issued executive orders pausing some funds from former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act along with funding for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. Trump has also been cutting grants to research institutions and dismantling whole agencies, like USAID, and many of the contracts and grants that come from those agencies.\n\nCarlson was planning to use her USDA grant money to hire 10 temporary workers from Guatemala to help with this year’s harvest. The grant would help pay to house the required workers on her property and the visa fees and airfare to fly the workers to and from the U.S.\n\nThe added workers on her farm would have been a game changer, she said. Since taking over the family farm in 2019, most of the labor has been done by her, her husband, two year-round employees and a few local seasonal workers. With the added help, she could run multiple shifts a day picking cherries to get as much of her crop harvested as possible before it starts to spoil. It also would give her more time with her four children, including her 3-year-old twins.\n\nThe program to bring over the foreign workers hasn’t been cheap or easy, but she saw it as the only way to boost her workforce.\n\n“The American worker doesn’t like labor, they don’t like to do laborious jobs,” Carlson said. “They don’t want to do the hard labor, and that’s what’s frustrating, because we would love to hire U.S. workers, but we can’t get them to show up. We can’t get them to follow through. We can’t get them to finish the season.”\n\nCarlson has been trying to get an answer from the USDA about the status of her grant, but her grant manager told her that they were “awaiting guidance from leadership.” When she followed up more recently, she received an out-of-office email.\n\n“We have had no direction from our grant project managers,\" she said. \"We’ve asked them, are we supposed to continue meeting our milestones and continue meeting our goals? Or do we stop and wait? All we get back with a response is an automated message.”\n\nTo prepare for the workers arrival, including renovating housing on her property to bring it up to code, Carlson has already spent $200,000 of her own money that she was expecting to get reimbursed under her grant’s contract. Without that money in her bank account, she doesn’t expect to have the funds to pay her existing staff to get through the growing season.\n\nCarlson also doesn’t have much time left to make a decision about whether to spend even more to bring workers over. By April 5, she is supposed to have purchased the airfare for the workers she was planning to hire, who were supposed to arrive in May.\n\n“We’re at that point where if we don’t get this funding, there could be issues of bankruptcy,” she said. “The American farmer is failing right now because you’re freezing funding meant to help the American farmer.”",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is moving to end temporary legal status for more than 530,000 people who arrived in the U.S. from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela through Biden-era temporary parole programs, according to a Federal Register document posted on Friday.\n\nThe parole programs are set to end on April 24, 30 days after the document is expected to be officially published in the Federal Register on Tuesday. People who had parole under these programs “must depart the United States before their parole termination date,” the document said.\n\nThe move comes after President Donald Trump on his first day in office directed his administration to “terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States,” pointing specifically to parole programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in the notice that her department’s termination of the parole programs “directly” fulfills Trump’s order and “complements and underscores the Administration’s pivot to a foreign policy that prioritizes the United States’ interests in a secure border.”\n\n“These programs do not serve a significant public benefit, are not necessary to reduce levels of illegal immigration, did not sufficiently mitigate the domestic effects of illegal immigration, are not serving their intended purposes, and are inconsistent with the Administration’s foreign policy goals,” she said in the document.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security will work to “remove” people who entered the U.S. under the programs and do not leave before the parole is terminated.\n\n“Aliens who have since obtained a lawful immigration status or other basis that permits them to remain in the United States are not required to depart the United States pursuant to this notice,” the document noted.\n\nThe parole programs had been put in place by the Biden administration and allowed migrants to stay in the U.S. for up to two years. Migrants were required to apply online, go through background checks and have a financial sponsor. They would also receive work authorization in the U.S.\n\nThe Biden administration began a parole policy for Venezuelans in 2022, later expanding the initiative to Nicaraguans, Haitians and Cubans. Under the initiative, up to 30,000 eligible people from the four countries combined could temporarily enter the U.S. each month.\n\nWhen reached for comment on the end of the parole programs, a senior DHS official slammed the programs as “disastrous.”\n\n“The termination of the CHNV parole programs, and the termination of parole for those who exploited it, is a return to common-sense policies, a return to public safety, and a return to America First,” the official said, using an abbreviated name for the programs.\n\nPrevious Trump administration moves setting up efforts to curtail parole programs have faced court challenges. A class action lawsuit was filed against the Trump administration last month urging the court to block the programs’ termination.",

        "title": "Saturn's rings will temporarily 'disappear' this weekend",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Saturn’s iconic rings will seem to “disappear” for a couple of days starting this weekend — at least from our vantage point on Earth.\n\nThe rings won’t actually vanish, but for a short time, the angle between Earth and Saturn will create something of a cosmic illusion, making the planet’s rings appear invisible from our point of view.\n\nThe reason this occurs has to do with the specific tilts of both planets. Saturn’s axis is tilted 26.73 degrees from vertical as it orbits the sun, which is similar to Earth’s 23.5-degree tilt, according to NASA. So as each planet rotates on its axis and orbits the sun, Saturn’s appearance, including its rings, can differ when viewed through telescopes or high-powered observatories on Earth.\n\nOccasionally, Saturn’s angle of tilt toward Earth turns the rings precisely edge-on, making it seem like the thin bands are gone.\n\n“They literally almost disappear,” said Sean Walker, an associate editor at Sky & Telescope, a monthly magazine about science and amateur astronomy. “Normally you see the rings around Saturn, but when you have an edge-on view, it looks like a hair-thin line of light just cutting across.”\n\nSaturn’s rings photographed by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft on May 15, 2017. Cassini-Huygens / NASA / JPL-Caltech / Space Science Institute\n\nIn recent months, Saturn’s vast rings have appeared to progressively thin when viewed through ground-based telescopes. By Sunday, the rings will reach that precise edge-on angle.\n\nThe illusion is temporary, lasting only about a day or two before the rings slowly start coming into view again.\n\nAnd the event is relatively rare: Ring plane crossings — as the phenomenon is known — typically occur twice during the 29.4 years it takes Saturn to make one orbit around the sun. This means they can be seen from Earth about once every 13 to 15 years.\n\nUnfortunately, however, Saturn will be too close to the sun this weekend for skywatchers to see how it looks without its rings. But another opportunity will come later this year, on Nov. 23, when the rings will be nearly edge-on (though not precisely).\n\nWalker said he witnessed a ring plane crossing in 1995, using a backyard telescope.\n\n“It was fantastic,” he said. “It looked like a different planet. I spent a good part of the night just drinking in that view.”\n\nIt was around that time, he said, when he was just starting to become interested in astronomy.\n\nSaturn’s rings photographed by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft on Nov. 28, 2016. Cassini-Huygens / NASA / JPL-Caltech / Space Science Institute\n\nIn addition to being a quirky product of geometry, a ring plane crossing also happens because of the structure of Saturn’s rings. The iconic accessories are made up of billions of swirling chunks of rock and ice but are relatively flat, which is why the rings can seem to disappear into a thin line when tilted edge-on to Earth.\n\nThe edge-on view also makes it easier to see more of Saturn’s moons, Walker said.\n\n“When we have these ring plane crossings, the light that normally reflects off Saturn’s rings is no longer glaring back toward Earth,” he said. “That means you can detect a lot more of the smaller moons.”\n\nWith a regular backyard telescope, Walker said, people can often spot four to six moons around Saturn. During a ring plane crossing in the dark sky, people may be able to detect nearly a dozen.\n\n“The really faint ones become apparent because they line up in almost a perfect line,” he said.\n\nAfter this weekend’s ring plane crossing, the next full one will take place in 2038. That event should be visible from Earth, according to Walker.\n\n“I’d love to see it again,” he said. “It’s just going to be a little while to wait.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said he prayed for “his friend” Donald Trump after an assassin’s bullet grazed the then-presidential candidate’s ear last year, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview Friday.\n\nAppearing on Tucker Carlson’s podcast, Witkoff praised Putin’s willingness to discuss how to end the war in Ukraine and said it was “preposterous” to say that Russia had designs on eventually attacking other countries in Europe.\n\nWitkoff, who has met with Putin twice, said during his second visit to Moscow the Russian president’s messages for Trump “got personal.” The Russian autocrat recounted his deep concern after Trump was targeted in an assassination attempt during a campaign stop in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July of last year, Witkoff said.\n\nPutin “told me a story ... about how when the president was shot, he went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed for the president,” Witkoff said. Putin did it “not because ... he could become the president of the United States, but because he had a friendship with him, and he was praying for his friend.”\n\nDuring the same visit, the Russian president presented a painting of Trump that he commissioned from a Russian artist as a gift to the American president, Witkoff said.\n\n“I came home and delivered that message to our president, and delivered the painting, and he was clearly touched by it,” Witkoff said. “So this is the kind of connection that we’ve been able to re-establish through, by the way, a simple word called communication.”\n\nWitkoff dismissed criticism of the Trump administration’s outreach to Putin, saying the only way to resolve the war in Ukraine is to speak to all sides in the conflict. He also rejected portrayals of Putin as a nefarious actor who can’t be trusted.\n\nWitkoff said some people might question if he should have met with the Russian president because they see Putin as “a bad guy.” But he said: “I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy.”\n\nA real estate tycoon and friend of the president who has become a top diplomatic envoy for Trump, Wiktoff said he appreciated Putin being open to meeting with him and communicating in a “straightforward” way.\n\n“I liked him. I thought he was straight up with me,” he said, adding that “it was gracious of him to accept me, to see me.”\n\nPoisonings, shootings and plane crashes\n\nPutin, a former KGB officer who has ruled Russia for the last 25 years, has been blamed for the killings of multiple Russian opposition leaders, most recently Alexei Navalny, who died in a Russian prison last year.\n\nMercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash last year, just months after leading his Wagner Group forces in an aborted mutiny against Putin. His short-lived rebellion was sparked by disagreements about the war in Ukraine. No investigative findings were released after the fiery crash, which also killed nine other people.\n\nBoris Nemtsov, once considered the leader of Russia’s opposition and one of Putin’s fiercest critics, was shot dead in 2015, just a few feet away from the Kremlin.\n\nAnd in 2018 former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in the U.K. with a nerve agent believed to be the same Novichok poison later used on Navalny. Two Russians also allegedly poisoned former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, an outspoken critic of Putin’s who had fled to the U.K.\n\nRenowned journalist Anna Politkovskaya was gunned down outside her Moscow apartment in 2006 after warning reporters in Russia about the risks of challenging the Kremlin’s narrative.\n\nPutin blamed Biden\n\nWitkoff said Putin pointed out in their meeting that he and former President Joe Biden did not speak for three years, which Witkoff called a mistake.\n\n“How do you settle a conflict unless we establish trust and good feelings with one another?” Witkoff said.\n\nTrump’s envoy said an administration official had warned him beforehand that Putin was a former KGB officer. But Witkoff said that background merely meant that Putin was among the elite in the former Soviet Union, as he said the spy service recruited highly capable people.\n\n“In the old days, the only people who went into the KGB were the smartest people in the nation,” Witkoff said. “That’s who went into the KGB. He’s a super smart guy.”\n\nPutin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine violated international law, and Russian forces appear to have committed war crimes there, according to European, United Nations and Biden administration officials. But Witkoff suggested the media coverage of the war had been distorted and that the conflict could not be blamed entirely on one side.\n\n“That is a complicated situation that war, and all the ingredients that led up to it,” he said.\n\nThe special envoy said the key to resolving the war in Ukraine was Russia’s claim to four eastern regions in Ukraine — Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. He called the issue “the elephant in the room.”\n\nUkraine opposes ceding the territory, which remains part of Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders.\n\nRussian troops occupy most of the regions and Moscow has held referendums on joining Russia, which Western countries and Ukraine have denounced as shams conducted under repression.\n\nBut Witkoff, who struggled to name all four of the regions in the interview, cited the Russian-organized votes as an indication that people in the area preferred Russian rule.\n\n“They’re Russian-speaking,” he said. “There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.”\n\nWitkoff said it was unclear if Ukraine could accept ceding that territory to Russia and if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could survive politically if he acknowledged Russian control of the area.\n\n“The Russians are de facto in control of these territories,” Witkoff said. “Will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?”\n\nHe added that Russia did not want to absorb all of Ukraine and that it already has what it wants, by taking the four eastern regions and the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n“The Russians also have what they want,” he said. “So why do they need more?”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "For the last four years, high school world history teacher Hadley DiForti has taught the story of Navy hero Doris Miller to her students.\n\nMiller, a cook on a ship, gunned down attacking Japanese planes at Pearl Harbor in 1941, before he led other sailors to safety. The effort made him the first Black sailor to receive the Navy Cross, and his image was used on recruitment posters.\n\nBut earlier this year, when DiForti went to a Navy website that she had used for years to teach the students about Miller’s story, it had been taken down, leaving her students feeling “significantly upset.”\n\n“I was extremely angry,” the Tennessee teacher said. “I’ve taught about him now for four years in a row, and kids really do like learning about him.” She has come to rely on .gov websites because she could trust them, she said, but “now, that’s not the case.”\n\nThe Department of Defense did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot told NBC News earlier this week that “DEI is dead at the Defense Department. Discriminatory Equity Ideology is a form of Woke cultural Marxism that has no place in our military. It Divides the force, Erodes unit cohesion and Interferes with the services’ core warfighting mission.”\n\nWhile one of the Navy’s webpages about Miller had been restored, others have not. He is one of many people from marginalized backgrounds documented in thousands of webpages and images whose military history has been scrubbed from Pentagon websites, following President Donald Trump’s executive order calling for government agencies to do away with anything that touches what may be perceived as diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n“We are pleased by the rapid compliance across the Department with the directive removing DEI content from all platforms,” Ullyot continued. “In the rare cases that content is removed — either deliberately or by mistake — that is out of the clearly outlined scope of the directive, we instruct the components and they correct the content accordingly.”\n\nSome pages about figures like Jackie Robinson, the Tuskegee Airmen, the Navajo Code Talkers and Desert Storm-era Gen. Colin Powell have been restored following public outrage. But many remain down and have not been restored.\n\n“It is both perplexing and disheartening to witness initiatives that, under the guise of DEI, obscure the very narratives that shape our collective history,” said Nika White, a long-time DEI expert and author of the book “Diversity Uncomplicated.” “Eliminating references to these figures not only undermines foundational principles of DEI but stands as a glaring contradiction to the pursuit of truth.”\n\nThe amount of truth that stands to be lost is substantial, given the countless contributions by Black people, people of color and members of the LGBTQ community who were military heroes and historical figures.\n\n“At its core, DEI is about recognizing and valuing the diverse experiences and contributions of all individuals, particularly those historically marginalized,” White said. “To erase these contributions is to engage in a form of historical revisionism that diminishes the legacies of countless service members who have fought valiantly for our country.”\n\nMultiple pages about Robinson, a second lieutenant in the Army who went on to break the color barrier in professional baseball, were taken down, including a page about Negro League players talking about serving in the military. But as of Wednesday afternoon, at least one page about Robinson, in a series about athletes who served in the military, had been reinstated.\n\nDoris Miller, who was the first African American sailor to receive the Navy Cross for his bravery during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. National Archives / U.S. Navy\n\nSimilarly, most of the webpages about Miller remain down. One Navy History and Heritage Command page about Miller has been restored, but a large red banner at the top of the site warns that content had been “revised or removed to align with the President’s executive orders and DoD priorities.” Other webpages about him on the Navy’s website remain down.\n\n“It’s not fair and it’s really shocking that our government would do this,” DiForti said. “I want our students to be able to look at those heroes that serve this country, that looked like them, and realize that they could be like them one day, and not just the heroes that look like me.”\n\nHenry-Louis Taylor, the director of urban studies at the University at Buffalo, said the omission of Black war heroes like Miller “reflects a broader effort to erase Black history and return to a time when U.S. history was a fantasy centered on white glory. If Trump’s goal had been a colorblind portrayal of military history, he could have simply omitted racial identifiers.”\n\nHe said it seems the objective has been to prioritize the history of white participation and heroism. “This erasure is not just an attack on Black and other people of color — it’s an attack on truth itself, turning history as a social science into history as a fairy tale.”\n\nDonald Williamson, who served 25 years in the Army, said the changes foretell “a sad day in America.”\n\n“This goes against everything we were taught about diversity and inclusion in our ranks,” he said.\n\nThe Army website had deleted and then reinstated this week the page for the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. More than a third of the soldiers were born to Japanese immigrants, and despite dealing with racism in the U.S., the 442nd became the most decorated unit in American military history for its size. The group, which had to be replenished several times, totaled about 14,000 soldiers, of which 9,486 received Purple Hearts, 21 Medals of Honor and eight Presidential Unit Citations.\n\nMissing last week on the Arlington National Cemetery website were pages about Hector Santa Anna, a World War II bomber pilot, as well as pages about dozens of notable Black, Latino and female veterans. Among the information missing was that for Powell, the former general who became the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is the highest rank in the military after the president. His page was restored on March 16.\n\nMedgar Evers, the civil rights icon who served in the Army during World War II, was removed from the Arlington Cemetery website as well. In 2017, Trump called Evers a “great American hero” at the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.\n\nTaylor, the historian, referred to the book “Black Reconstruction in America” by scholar W.E.B. DuBois. In it, DuBois argued that white scholars had deliberately falsified American history to create a narrative that offered a “false but comforting sense of accomplishment,” Taylor said.\n\nDuBois said in the book that such manipulation had led people to describe history as “lies agreed upon” and warned that this misinformation would have destructive consequences. Taylor said DuBois foresaw what’s happening now.\n\n“Nothing good can come of this,” Taylor said.",

        "content": "BROOKLINE, Mass. — Kitty Dukakis, the wife of former Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, who spoke openly about her struggles with depression and addiction, has died. She was 88.\n\nDukakis died on Friday night surrounded by her family, her son, John Dukakis, said on Saturday by telephone. She fought to make the world better, “sharing her vulnerabilities to help others face theirs,” her family said in a statement.\n\n“She was loving, feisty and fun, and had a keen sensitivity to people from all walks of life,” the family said. “She and our dad, Michael Dukakis, shared an enviable partnership for over 60 years and loved each other deeply.”\n\nDukakis won high marks as a political campaigner during her husband’s 1988 presidential efforts, stumping tirelessly for him. She was called a key influence in his decision to seek the presidency.\n\nShe even figured in the opening question of a 1988 presidential debate, when her husband was asked: “Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?” Dukakis said he would not, and his unemotional response was widely criticized.\n\nKitty Dukakis and Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in Brookline, Mass., in 1989. David Tenenbaum / AP file\n\nEarlier in the campaign, in 1987, Dukakis revealed she had overcome a 26-year addiction to amphetamines five years earlier after receiving treatment. She said she began taking diet pills at age 19.\n\nHer husband made anti-drug efforts a major issue and she became prominent in the effort to educate youngsters against the perils of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nBut a few months after Michael Dukakis lost the election to Vice President George H.W. Bush, Kitty Dukakis entered a 60-day treatment program for alcoholism. Several months later she suffered a relapse and was hospitalized after drinking rubbing alcohol.\n\nIn her 1990 autobiography, “Now You Know,” she blamed her mother for much of her alcohol and drug addiction and a long history of low self-esteem. In 2006, she wrote another book, “Shock,” which credits the electroconvulsive therapy she began in 2001 for relieving the depression she had suffered for years. The treatment, she wrote, “opened a new reality for me.”\n\nCurrent Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey called Dukakis “a force for good in public life and behind the scenes,” a leader in the effort to ensure that the Holocaust is never forgotten, and an advocate for children, women and refugees.\n\n“She spoke courageously about her struggles with substance use disorder and mental health, which serves as an inspiration to us all to break down stigma and seek help,” Healey said in a statement.\n\nDukakis used her personal pain to help others, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said in a statement on social media on Saturday.\n\n“Her legacy will live on in the policies she helped shape and the people she inspired to speak their own truths,” Campbell said.\n\nDukakis and her future husband met while attending high school in Brookline, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb. He was dull and frugal; she was dramatic and fancy. He is Greek Orthodox; she was Jewish.\n\nDukakis, who was divorced and had a 3-year-old son, married Dukakis in 1963, and they had two children, Andrea and Kara.\n\nDukakis, whose late father, Harry Ellis Dickson, was associate conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, earned degrees in modern dance and broadcasting.\n\nAfter the presidential election, in 1989, Bush appointed her to be a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.\n\nShe earlier served on the President’s Commission on the Holocaust in 1979 and on the board of directors of the Refugee Policy Group. She has also been a member of the Task Force on Cambodian Children.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Dukakis and her husband divided their time between Massachusetts and California, where she was a social worker and he was a professor for part of the year at the University of California, Los Angeles.",

        "content": "In a coaching rematch from the 1996 Final Four, John Calipari’s Arkansas Razorbacks upset Rick Pitino’s St. John’s Red Storm on Saturday, clinching a Sweet 16 berth with a 75-66 win.\n\nThe game was a slugfest befitting two of the sport’s most storied — and most colorful — coaches, and the Razorbacks ultimately held on in the second half after a physical, often ugly battle. Neither team shot well, combining to hit only 4 of 41 3-pointers, shooting a combined 34.8% from the field overall.\n\nAfter a back-and-forth first half, Arkansas went on a 7-0 run to end the first period, taking a 35-32 lead into the break. In the final 20 minutes, the Razorbacks initially raced out to a 13-point advantage, leading 55-42 with a little over 11 minutes remaining.\n\nThe Red Storm clawed their way back, however, putting together an 18-7 run to close the gap to 62-60 with roughly six minutes to go. Employing Pitino’s signature full-court press, St. John’s was able to muck up the game to set up a close finish.\n\nUltimately, Arkansas made more plays down the stretch, finishing the game on a 13-6 run of their own to close it out.\n\nThe Red Storm were unable to overcome a poor performance by guard R.J. Luis Jr, who entered Saturday averaging 18.5 points per game. Against the Razorbacks, Luis Jr. scored only nine points on 3-of-17 shooting.\n\nArkansas was led by freshman guard Billy Richmond III, who came off the bench to score 16 points.\n\nCalipari, in his first season leading the Razorbacks after 15 years at Kentucky, advanced past the second round for the first time since 2019. He now has an opportunity to do what only Pitino has done in men’s NCAA basketball history: win a national championship with two different schools.\n\nPitino, on the other hand, was denied the chance to lead a record fourth school to the Final Four.",

        "content": "Pope Francis is scheduled to be discharged from the hospital on Sunday, his doctors at Gemelli Hospital said.\n\nFrancis, 88, was hospitalized for bronchitis on Feb. 14 and remained under care for more than five weeks. At times, the pope was in critical condition and required high-flow oxygen therapy, according to the Vatican, and his changing health status captivated the world’s attention.\n\nAddressing reporters outside the hospital in Rome on Saturday, the pope’s doctors acknowledged that his condition had been “life threatening” on two occasions, but confirmed he has remained stable for at least two weeks.\n\n“We have prepared to welcome him home,” Dr. Luigi Carbone said.\n\nHis doctors added that he will be under a “protected discharge,” which will require ongoing medications, oxygen assistance as needed and a period of rest “for at least two months.”\n\n“Immediately, he won’t be able to continue his work activity of meeting groups of people or important work, that he will likely be able to do once he has finished the period of convalescence prescribed and the clinical improvements are verified,” Dr. Sergio Alfieri said.\n\nCarbone added: “The Holy Father is improving, so let’s hope that soon he will be able to continue his normal activity.”\n\nThroughout his illness, the Vatican has maintained that Francis has has continued to fulfill his duties. However, he has remained out of the public eye for weeks. Notably, Francis was unable to attend the Catholic Church’s jubilee celebration, a tradition dedicated to the remission of sins that occurs every 50 years, also known as the Holy Year.\n\nDespite his health battles, the Vatican made no indications that the pope would resign, unlike his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who stepped down in 2013 in a move that prompted global outrage.\n\nThe Vatican said in a statement earlier Saturday that the pope will greet a crowd of gatherers outside the hospital on Sunday, marking his first public appearance since his treatment began.\n\nFrancis’ hospitalization in recent weeks was not his first time battling serious ailments. In 2021, he underwent surgery for a gastrointestinal disease called diverticulitis, and again in 2023 for a hernia.\n\nIn the weeks before his hospitalization, the pope was seen with a sling around his arm, which, according to the Vatican, was necessary after the pope suffered a fall.\n\nFrancis has been leader of the Catholic Church’s more than 1 billion members since 2013.",

        "content": "Create your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\n\nThe Department of Justice on Friday asked a Cornell University student who is suing the Trump administration after helping lead campus protests last year to surrender to immigration authorities, according to a new court filing.\n\nLawyers for Momodou Taal, a Ph.D. student who is a U.S. visa holder and a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia, said in court documents that he received an email from a Department of Justice lawyer informing him for the first time that the government intended to serve him with a notice to appear — which initiates the deportation process — and an invitation to surrender to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThe email did not specify when the Justice Department expects Taal to surrender to immigration authorities.\n\nEric Lee, one of Taal’s attorneys, told NBC News on Saturday that in the days before the email was sent, unidentified authorities showed up outside Taal’s student apartment building and began asking other residents about him. The building’s staff then asked the authorities to leave, Lee said.\n\n\"It is not yet clear what grounds for removal the government alleges exist here,\" Lee said in his court filing on Friday, adding that Taal has been living in the U.S. and has been admitted into the country multiple times.\n\n\"The only changes between Mr. Taal’s last admission and now are the executive orders and the initiation of this legal action challenging them\" the court filing reads. \"It is plain that the government’s effort to serve and detain Mr. Taal are in reaction to this litigation.\"\n\nMomodou Taal. Courtesy Eric Lee\n\nLee told NBC News the court asked the Justice Department to explain its actions by 5 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment or questions about which agency sought out Taal at his home.\n\nCornell University did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. The Department of Homeland Security also did not respond.\n\nLast weekend, Taal and two U.S. citizens challenged the Trump administration’s executive orders to “combat anti-semitism” on college campuses and expel foreign nationals who the administration says pose national security threats.\n\nTaal, 31, and the other plaintiffs have argued that the orders violate the free speech rights of international students and scholars who protest or express support for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nTaal’s case comes amid a wider effort by the Trump administration to exert leverage in the affairs of private institutions of higher education.\n\nEarlier this month, the administration alarmed many observers when immigration officials arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student who led similar protests at the school last year. Khalil is fighting his deportation while detained in Louisiana. Lee said Kahlil’s arrest heightened Taal’s concerns about being apprehended by immigration authorities and helped prompt his lawsuit.\n\nThe Trump administration has cited an obscure national security clause in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify Khalil’s apprehension. The provision allows the secretary of state to deport noncitizens if the secretary determines their presence in the United States could adversely affect foreign policy.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said on X earlier this month that the department would be revoking visas and green cards of noncitizens who he claims support Hamas.\n\nImmigration officials arrested a second Columbia student, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank who officials say overstayed her student visa. A third Columbia student, Indian national Ranjani Srinivasan, fled to Canada after her student visa was revoked. Srinivasan has claimed she did not participate in the campus protests last spring.\n\nA doctor and professor from Brown University was deported this month after attempting to return to the U.S. from a trip to Lebanon. Homeland Security officials said Monday that the professor told them she attended the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the slain leader of Iran-back Hezbollah.\n\nMost recently, a graduate student who was teaching at Georgetown University on a student visa was detained this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has also gone after the universities themselves in retaliation for the protests on college campuses last year.\n\nOn March 7, the administration announced it was stripping Columbia — which was the epicenter of the protests — of $400 million in federal grants. This week, the White House said in a statement it was pausing $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania for allowing a transgender swimmer to compete on its women’s team.\n\nIn an effort to start negotiations on restoring the federal funding, Columbia on Friday agreed to demands outlined by the Trump administration.\n\nThe university will now ban students from wearing masks at protests in most cases, modify its admissions process, hire 36 new campus security officers — who, unlike previous security officers, will have the ability to arrest students — and appoint a new senior vice provost to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies.\n\nThe moves have prompted some new protests and raised concerns nationwide about the federal government’s infringement on free speech. Some students and professors at Columbia told NBC News in recent weeks that they fear the government will come after them if they speak out.\n\nProtests are scheduled to resume at Columbia on Monday.\n\nCLARIFICATION (March 22, 2025, 5:10 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misconstrued part of the email Taal received. It informed him of the government’s intent to serve a notice to appear, but was not itself the notice.",

        "content": "Columbia University has agreed to a list of demands by the Trump administration in order to start negotiations on restoring $400 million in federal funding that was stripped from the university earlier this month, representing a striking concession by the private university to the federal government.\n\nThe Trump administration canceled the university’s federal grants on March 7, accusing the New York school of \"inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" The abrupt cancellation of funds will end dozens, if not hundreds, of the university’s cutting-edge medical and scientific research projects.\n\nBut last week, the administration sent a letter to the university laying out nine demands that Columbia needed to accept to potentially restore funds and save the research.\n\nIn a document the university provided to the federal government and published online Friday, it appears the Trump administration got much of what it asked for.\n\nThe university has agreed to ban students from wearing masks at protests, hire 36 new campus security officers — who, unlike previous security officers, will have the ability to arrest students — and appoint a new senior vice provost to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies.\n\nColumbia also committed to “greater institutional neutrality” and said it is “working with a faculty committee to establish an institution-wide policy implementing this stance.” The university added that it will review its admissions procedures to “ensure unbiased admission processes,” as the Trump administration requested.\n\nColumbia's interim president, Katrina Armstrong, said Friday that the school responded to the Trump administration to \"ensure uninterrupted academic activities.\"\n\n“We have much to be proud of as a community, and it has been a privilege to share our progress and plans,” she said in a statement. “In the spirit of great American universities, we expect Columbians to engage in robust debate and discussion about our way forward, and we welcome it as an opportunity to shape the future of Columbia.”\n\nThe concessions by one of the nation’s oldest and most prestigious universities represent an unprecedented shift in how the federal government exerts leverage in the affairs of higher education institutions in the U.S.\n\nA pro-Palestinian encampment on the campus of Columbia University in New York City last year. Spencer Platt / Getty Images file\n\nOn Thursday, a student-led group that organizes and leads school protests, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, slammed the notion of Columbia striking a deal with the Trump administration.\n\n\"Columbia’s refusal to divest from, and even doubling down on, the genocide of the Palestinian people these past 17 months has made its expected response to the Trump Administration’s ransom note incredibly clear,\" the group wrote on Instagram. \"Columbia has no intention of defending its students or faculty from the government’s crackdown on Palestinian activism, instead it actively joins hands with the fascist state to sell out its community.\"\n\nOn Thursday, 41 of the roughly 100 members of the university's history department warned the university against allowing the administration to interfere in its policy. They compared the administration's actions to attempts by \"authoritarian regimes\" to seek control over independent academic institutions.\n\n\"Such interventions jeopardize our ability to think honestly about the past, the present, and the future, and to do so with our students, who deserve every opportunity to learn and to think for themselves,\" the history department members wrote. \"Should this control be realized, here or elsewhere, it would make any real historical scholarship, teaching, and intellectual community impossible.”\n\nThe Trump administration's demands are the latest hit for the Ivy League school, seen as the epicenter of student-led pro-Palestinian demonstrations that eventually overtook life at college campuses across the nation.\n\nThe protests were prompted by the Israeli government's fierce response to the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks. Israel's military has killed nearly 50,000 people living in Gaza and displaced millions. Student activists staged the demonstrations in an attempt to get their universities to divest from companies linked to the Israeli government.\n\nFor weeks last spring, Columbia students staged daily protests, established an encampment of several dozen tents on university lawns and at one point occupied a university building. Dozens of students were arrested in demonstrations that regularly featured controversial political slogans, including \"from the river to the sea,\" which some have criticized as antisemitic.\n\nDemonstrators supporting Palestinians in Gaza barricade themselves inside Hamilton Hall, where the office of the dean is located, on April 30, 2024, in New York City. Alex Kent / Getty Images file\n\nSome Jewish students joined the protesters on college campuses, while others said they felt like the demonstrations were hateful. Several Jewish students also reported being assaulted at other universities.\n\nAllie Wong, a Ph.D. student who was arrested while protesting on campus in April of last year, said that while the protests were divisive, she believes the challenges facing Columbia unite students around a common cause.\n\n\"In terms of student response, I think that you’re actually going to have many more students involved in this, because it is no longer, you know, divestment, Israel, Palestine. It’s about all these other things,\" she said, referring to democracy and freedom of speech. \"And I would argue there is no group on campus that these issues do not reach.\"\n\nStudents stage a walkout protest at Columbia University’s Low Library steps on March 11 to condemn the presence of ICE agents on campus and call for the release of Mahmoud Khalil. Dana Edwards / REUTERS\n\nThe threats to federal funding followed the Justice Department's launch in February of a task force to \"root out\" what it calls \"anti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses.\"\n\nAmid the negotiations over the grants, federal immigration officials apprehended at least two Columbia students who participated in the student-led protest, including 30-year-old Mahmoud Khalil. A doctoral student from India, Ranjani Srinivasan, also fled to Canada after her student visa was revoked.\n\nMohammad Hemeida, who chairs Columbia's student governing board, said he hopes that by allowing the Trump administration to declare a victory, immigration officials will lay off students.\n\n\"The look of Columbia bowing down is not good,\" he said. \"But what I'm worried about mostly is students being targeted, and I feel like they've used that as a tactic to pressure the institution.\"\n\nThe arrests prompted new protests on campus and raised concerns nationwide about the federal government's infringement on free speech.\n\nThe university’s journalism school described the apprehensions as \"witnessing and experiencing an alarming chill.\"\n\n\"One does not have to agree with the political opinions of any particular individual to understand that these threats cut to the core of what it means to live in a pluralistic democracy,\" the journalism school said in a statement last week. \"The use of deportation to suppress foreign critics runs parallel to an aggressive campaign to use libel laws in novel — even outlandish ways — to silence or intimidate the independent press.\"\n\nColumbia students are on their spring break and will return to campus next week.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — Acting Social Security Commissioner Leland Dudek is backing down on a threat to cease operations at the agency after a federal judge blocked staffers at Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive data housed at the agency.\n\nDudek’s reversal comes after U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander on Thursday granted a request by several union groups seeking to stop “DOGE affiliates” from accessing the personal and private data of millions of Americans, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, birth and marriage certificates, bank and credit card information and tax information.\n\nHollander said DOGE was engaged in a “fishing expedition” for fraud based on “little more than suspicion” and said the temporary organization “never identified or articulated even a single reason for which the DOGE Team needs unlimited access to SSA’s entire record systems.”\n\nDudek, in a series of interviews following the judge’s decision, criticized the ruling as being overly broad and threatened to terminate access to sensitive data for every employee at the agency, arguing they could all be considered “DOGE affiliates.”\n\n“My anti-fraud team would be DOGE affiliates. My IT staff would be DOGE affiliates,” Dudek said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Thursday. “As it stands, I will follow it exactly and terminate access by all SSA employees to our IT systems.”\n\n“Really, I want to turn it off and let the courts figure out how they want to run a federal agency,” he added.\n\nIn a pair of letters Friday, Hollander called Dudek’s interpretation of her ruling “inaccurate,” clarifying that her decision should have “no bearing on ordinary operations at SSA.”\n\n“Employees of SSA who are not involved with the DOGE Team or in the work of the DOGE Team are not subject to the Order. A DOGE Affiliate is defined in the Order as a person working on or implementing the DOGE agenda,” Hollander wrote.\n\nDudek hours later walked back his threat.\n\n“The Court issued clarifying guidance about the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) related to DOGE employees and DOGE activities at the Social Security Administration (SSA). Therefore, I am not shutting down the agency,” he said in a statement Friday. “SSA employees and their work will continue under the TRO.”\n\nDudek’s predecessor, Michelle King, departed the agency last month after refusing to comply with DOGE’s bid to access sensitive government records at the agency.\n\nHolland’s ruling is one of several concerning attempts by DOGE employees to access private data at multiple federal agencies.\n\nIn February, a federal judge temporarily blocked DOGE staffers from accessing sensitive information stored within the Treasury Department after 19 state attorneys general filed a lawsuit claiming the staffers had no authority to access the information.\n\nAnother DOGE staffer in February was granted limited access to anonymized taxpayer information housed within the IRS after reaching an agreement with the agency.",

        "content": "Three people were killed and 15 others were injured in a shooting at an \"an unsanctioned car show\" in a park in Las Cruces, New Mexico, Friday night, police said.\n\nThe Las Cruces Police Department said the violence involving multiple firearms happened around 10 p.m. at Young Park, over 200 miles south of Albuquerque.\n\nA preliminary investigation revealed that an altercation between two groups at the car show escalated into gunfire, injuring many, including bystanders who may have been struck by crossfire, Police Chief Jeremy Story said, noting there were around 200 people at the park at the time of the shooting.\n\n\"That altercation escalated to gunfire between both groups,\" he said at a news conference, later adding: \"We know that there was some type of ill will between these groups prior to last night.\"\n\nTwo victims were killed at the scene and a third was pronounced dead at the hospital, Las Cruces Fire Chief Mark Daniels said. The three victims are a 16-year-old boy, an 18-year-old man, and a 19-year-old man, police said in an update Saturday afternoon. The department previously stated the deceased included two 19-year-olds.\n\nFifteen others were injured in the shooting, including seven victims who were treated on the scene and seven who were taken to area hospitals and then to nearby El Paso, Texas, for further treatment, according to Daniels. Those injured ranged in age from 16 to 26, police said.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News on Saturday, Story described the most critically injured patients as \"fighting for their lives.\"\n\nIt is not clear what started the altercation between the two groups, Story said. The chief said it was a wild night before gunfire broke out in the parking lot area of the park on Friday.\n\n\"There was already craziness going on before the shooting, with people sticking guns out the window and driving and doing doughnuts,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a huge crime scene with a lot of moving parts. It will take time to process it thoroughly and reopen everything,\" he said.\n\nMultiple shots fired from the incident could be heard in a video shared to social media. The majority of the shooting took place in the parking lot at the park, but bullet casings were also found down the street, according to officials. Around 50 to 60 bullet casings were found in total, they said.\n\nNo arrests have been made in connection with the shooting as of Saturday afternoon, but Story said that multiple persons of interest have been detained, and investigators asked for a judge's permission to search multiple locations in the Las Cruces area.\n\nA vehicle with gunfire damage that may have been involved in the incident was located, he said, and multiple guns were found at the scene and elsewhere, he said.\n\n\"I'm confident that hopefully we'll be able to put out a release that at least there's been some arrests made,\" Story said. \"But we're not quite there.\"\n\n\"It appears that both sides are shooting with handguns,\" the chief said. \"We have recovered some handguns that were discarded in different places. We've recovered some handguns on scene. And so we don't have all of them, but we do have some of them.\"\n\nStory said a person who was holding an AR-15 rifle in pictures circulating on social media has been interviewed, and while he said the images were concerning, that individual was not involved in the shooting.\n\nYoung Park has been \"troubled with crime\" in recent years, Story said. Unsanctioned car shows have also \"become an issue\" in the area.\n\nThe chief said at the news conference that Friday's outcome might also have been different if he had had more officers available and that the shooting was an example of \"the utter lack of fear of accountability in New Mexico.\"\n\nGov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the shooting left her \"heartbroken and horrified.\" In a statement on Saturday, she said state resources will bolster the investigation.\n\nLujan Grisham said the state Legislature has failed to act amid \"the disturbing rise in violent crime in Las Cruces,\" a city of nearly 115,000 about 45 miles north of El Paso. She urged New Mexicans to pressure legislators to call a special session in what she called a \"public safety crisis.\"\n\n\"The indiscriminate nature of this shooting is both shocking and unacceptable, but sadly not surprising,\" Lujan Grisham said.\n\nLas Cruces Mayor Eric Enriquez called the shooting \"a heinous act of violence\" that will leave the city in mourning.\n\n\"As with all acts of gun violence in our city and beyond, my heart is broken for the victims and families impacted,\" Enriquez wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nYoung Park and roadways leading to it are temporarily closed as the investigation is in process, police said.\n\nThe Las Cruces Police Department is asking anyone with information or footage of the incident to get in touch with them.\n\nThe FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the New Mexico State Police and the Dona Ana County Sheriff’s Office are assisting with the investigation.",

        "content": "Hand sanitizers are rarely glamorous, unless you have one from Touchland. The brand’s chic packaging, hydrating formula and delicious scents have completely turned traditional hand sanitizers on their head, especially in a market that seems dominated by drying gel formulas (and as someone who grew up with a germaphobe mom and had hand sanitizers attached to my hip, the heavy alcohol scent still haunts me to this day).\n\nMy mom introduced me to Touchland’s buzzy hand sanitizers a few years back, and now everyone I know uses them (its widespread popularity doesn’t come as a surprise considering the brand reached $100 million in sales last year). These $10 mists have become status symbols among teens and adults alike: My siblings, who are 8, 10 and 13 years old, have multiple in their backpacks, and so do most of their classmates. The more you have, the higher your “cool” factor, according to my Gen-Z and Gen Alpha siblings.\n\nKeep reading to learn more about why I and everyone else are obsessed with these pocket-sized hand sanitizers right now.\n\nSKIP AHEAD What is Touchland hand sanitizer? | Why are Touchland’s hand sanitizers so popular right now? | How does Touchland compare to alternatives? | Why trust NBC Select?\n\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nWhat is Touchland hand sanitizer?\n\nThe spray hand sanitizers are made with alcohol, aloe vera and radish root ferment filtrate to kill bacteria, hydrate your skin and retain moisture so your hand stays soft, according to the brand. What makes these hand sanitizers stand out is their pleasant yet subtle scents (each of which has its own correlating color). The current Power Mist lineup has 14 scents and one fragrance-free version.\n\nBecause many of our staff members love these hand sanitizers so much, we frequently repurchase them to try out new scents and to make sure each bag and pocket has one. Courtesy Bianca Alvarez\n\nA button on the sanitizer’s small, square packaging (roughly the size of your palm) triggers a fine mist that, unlike the gel consistency of a typical hand sanitizer, doesn’t feel goopy or messy. It takes about 20 seconds to dry, so application is quick and easy.\n\nThe Power Mist Hydrating Hand Sanitizers are sold individually and available in packs and sets. Touchland also collaborates with other brands (like Hello Kitty) and has limited-edition seasonal scents, including Peppermint Mocha and Spiced Pumpkin-Tini, throughout the year. The brand also has specialty versions, including Glow Mist (to sanitize, hydrate and improve tone and texture) and Gentle Mist (to sanitize, hydrate and soothe skin). These are usually more expensive at $16 each.\n\nWhy are Touchland's hand sanitizers so popular right now?\n\nI can't leave home without my Touchland hand sanitizers, and for good reason: They're easy to apply, smell great and leave my hands feeling soft and hydrated.\n\nSpray bottle packaging\n\nWhat stands out to me about these hand sanitizers is that they don’t have a cap (which, in my experience with traditional hand sanitizers, create a liquid mess). Instead, it comes in a small spray bottle, so a gentle mist activates at the press of a button. This packaging makes it easy to spray and disinfect with just one hand. It was also easier for my siblings to use when they were younger, and it’s still a more convenient option for my grandparents and anyone with dexterity issues.\n\nThese are so portable and small that they can fit in my palm so I can comfortably grip and spray. Courtesy Bianca Alvarez\n\nUnlike other hand sanitizers, which traditionally have a cylinder shape, these are flat, slim and compact. Their size is comparable to that of a cardholder, and the width is similar to an iPhone. This makes them perfect for slipping into my pockets and my purse. I can toss them into my luggage without taking up much room (plus, they’re under three ounces, so they meet TSA standards).\n\nYou can also secure the sanitizer using the Hand Mist Case or its pouch, The Touchette. At school pick-up, I notice my siblings and their friends have one attached to each of their backpacks, and my aunts and uncles have it on their diaper bags at family functions.\n\nSubtle but great scent\n\nLast week, I smelled something rosy and fragrant, and thought one of my coworkers sprayed perfume. But when I turned to her and asked what the smell was, it turns out that all she did was spray her Touchland hand sanitizer. While many hand sanitizers on the market are on opposite sides of the spectrum in terms of scent (some are too fragrant, while others smell like chemicals), Touchland found the perfect balance between fragrant and effective.\n\nThe scents aren’t overwhelming to the point where you get a headache or feel nauseous, and they mask the smell of alcohol in the formula. While most hand sanitizers leave an intense, chemical-heavy smell on my hands several minutes after I apply them, Touchland’s scented versions leave a pleasant aroma that subtly lingers.\n\nEven the fragrance-free option (which I often use because I have sensitive skin) doesn’t have that rubbing alcohol smell. Plus, each scent is brightly dyed, making it fun to look at and hold. All three generations of my family found multiple Power Mists that they love and alternate between regularly.\n\nEight Touchland hand sanitizers lay flat on a table in 2 rows, with four at the top and four at the bottom. Courtesy Bianca Alvarez\n\nHydrating and lightweight feel\n\nYou might find that many common sanitizers leave an uncomfortable residue that’s sticky or greasy, regardless of whether it’s in spray or gel form. Thankfully, the Touchland sprays are the complete opposite.\n\nBecause the mist is so incredibly fine and lightweight, it takes only seconds to absorb, and it doesn’t leave a trace on my hands (besides a pleasant scent). Usually, I would have to run to apply hand cream after applying a typical hand sanitizer, but despite having alcohol in the formula, Touchland’s sanitizers are hydrating enough on their own. Plus, neither the scented or unscented versions trigger or irritate my sensitive, eczema-prone skin.\n\nHow does Touchland hand sanitizer compare to alternatives?\n\nThe Touchland Power Mist Hydrating Hand Sanitizer is around the same price as similar sprays like the Noshinku Refillable Natural Hand Sanitizer ($9), and it falls in the middle range of popular options like the Bath & Body Works Spray ($3.95) and Primally Pure Hand Sanitizer ($16). Touchland is more expensive than your everyday sanitizers, like the Purell Hand Sanitizer ($2.50), but they don’t have that drying, smelly and messy gel formula, which makes them worth the higher price tag, in my opinion.\n\nWhat makes Touchland stand out from most of its competitors is its packaging — most spray and gel options have caps you have to mess with and are bulkier, so they take up more room in my pockets and bags. Plus, with so many scents and accessories to choose from, there’s an option for everyone.\n\nWhy trust NBC Select?\n\nI’m an associate reporter, and I write about new product launches and beauty and wellness topics, including recent stories on the best body serums and eye creams. For this story, I shared my experience using Touchland Hand Sanitizer for five years.\n\nCatch up on NBC Select’s in-depth coverage of tech and tools, wellness and more, and follow us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to stay up to date.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "ROME — Pope Francis is recovering well from pneumonia and a “new stage” in his pontificate is opening, two of his closest advisers said Friday, offering notes of optimism as the 88-year-old pontiff hit the five-week mark in his hospitalization.\n\nArchbishop Edgar Peña Parra told The Associated Press that he had found Francis in good humor and serene during the three times he has visited the pope at the Gemelli hospital in Rome.\n\nPeña Parra, who is the Vatican chief of staff, visited Francis on Feb. 24, March 2 and March 9 along with the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the lone Vatican officials who have called on him aside from his personal secretaries.\n\n“The pope will recover,” Peña Parra said on the sidelines of a book launch. “The pope is recovering well. The doctors say that he needs some time, but it’s going well progressively.”\n\n“I found him well, serene, in good humor, and — just like him — tough with the desire to go forward,” he said.\n\nThe Vatican press office reported Friday that Francis’ overall condition remained stable, with slight improvements as he continues respiratory and physical physiotherapy. He was continuing to reduce his reliance on high-flow supplemental oxygen he has needed to breathe during the day and no longer needs the mechanical ventilation mask at night.\n\nIn other comments Friday, another top friend and ally of the pope, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernández, said that “a new stage” was opening in Francis’ 12-year pontificate and that he expects some surprises from the pontiff when he’s released.\n\nFernández, the Argentine theologian who Francis brought in as the Vatican’s doctrine chief, said that he had been in touch with Francis since his Feb. 14 hospitalization and was heartened that he had stabilized. He provided no time frame on when Francis might be released, but ruled out any thought that he might resign.\n\nHe said that he understood that Francis was responding well to treatment, but that doctors were keeping him at the hospital “to be 100%.” He said that Francis needed rehabilitation therapy to help him regain strength to speak after so many weeks on noninvasive mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.\n\nFernández revealed that Francis had resisted going to the hospital when his bronchitis worsened, and only agreed to go after people close to him threatened to quit if he didn’t.\n\n“I don’t know what swear words they used (to tell him) you have to go there, otherwise we go home and end our relationship here,” he said.\n\nAs a result, he said he knew that the hospitalization had been hard on Francis and had surely made him reflect.\n\n“I think a new stage is opening for him. He is a man of surprises, who will surely have learned so many things in this month and he’ll pull who knows what out of the hat,” he said. “So even knowing that this has been a very heavy effort for him, a difficult time, I know it will be fruitful for the church and for the world.”\n\nFrancis hit the five-week mark in his hospitalization Friday. He was admitted Feb. 14 with a bad case of bronchitis that developed into a complex lung infection and double pneumonia. He has long battled respiratory illnesses and had part of one lung removed when he was a young man. He has admitted to being a bad patient and is a known workaholic.\n\n“He wants to spend what little time he has left and says ‘I want to use it and not to take care of myself,’” Fernández said. “And then what happens? He comes back here and it’s not easy for him to follow the advice” of doctors.\n\nThat might change after this experience, he said.\n\n“He has to certainly change, but I can’t say what those details might be,” he said.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "If you have fine hair, you’ve probably come across shampoos labeled as thickening, volumizing and/or clarifying. For the average shopper, these labels and ingredients might as well be written in another language, says hairstylist Timothy Aylward. Some are like a puzzle, and one wrong piece can be the difference between a great hair day or a greasy one.\n\nI spoke to hair care experts about what to look for and avoid when shopping for a shampoo for fine hair. I also rounded up their recommendations for the best options to shop.\n\nSKIP AHEAD How I picked the best fine hair shampoo | The best shampoos for fine hair | What to know about fine hair shampoos | How to shop for fine hair shampoo | What to avoid if you have fine hair | Why trust NBC Select?\n\nHow I picked the best fine hair shampoo\n\nWhen shopping for a shampoo specifically formulated for fine hair, experts recommend keeping the following factors in mind:\n\nGentle ingredients: I sought out shampoos that are free of harsh cleansers like sodium lauryl sulfate, opting instead for gentler ingredients like sodium lauryl sarcosinate or cocamidopropyl betaine, which are less irritating on the scalp.

I also looked for lightweight conditioners that hydrate fine hair without weighing it down. Volumizing formula: Fine hair shampoos are typically formulated to provide fuller looking strands by either penetrating the hair cuticle to expand it on the inside, or coating the exterior of the hair to appear more full, says New York City-based trichologist Shab Caspara. The goal is to lift and volumize, not weigh hair down.\n\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nThe best shampoos for fine hair in 2025\n\nI consulted celebrity hairstylists and trichologists (hair health experts) on the best volumizing shampoos and rounded up their picks, plus some NBC Select staff favorites below.\n\nR+Co’s thickening shampoo and conditioner are favorites of hairstylist Bobby Eliot because they are made with the vitamin biotin, a popular hair care ingredient or supplement that helps increase hair strength, says Eliot. Palmetto berry extract also adds body to the strands, which creates a thicker effect, according to R+Co, and smells like a mix of cardamom, pineapple, tangerine and bamboo.\n\nBest volumizing shampoo: Maxxam Volumizing Shampoo\n\nThis Maxxam shampoo accomplishes exactly what a fine hair shampoo should: It doesn’t add buildup and instead gently cleanses the hair and scalp to promote healthy hair growth, and make it appear fuller, says Caspara. Its formula is “not only gentle and free of harsh sulfates, but also nourishes the scalp, improves volume and strengthens the hair by using a soothing kelp extract complex,” she says.\n\nMost hydrating: Innersense Pure Harmony Hairbath\n\nInnersense Pure Harmony Hairbath $ 30.00 Innersense What we like Reduces breakage\n\nCombats frizz\n\nRefillable Something to note Not in pump packaging\n\nInnersense’s Pure Harmony Hairbath is another one of Caspara’s favorites. “It’s an extremely clean yet effective brand that is designed for fine to medium hair to provide volume and gentle cleansing,” she says. The shampoo is sulfate-free and formulated with quinoa, rice extracts, shea butter and coconut and avocado oils, which nourish and hydrate hair without weighing it down, according to the brand.\n\nThis Ouai shampoo is free of harsh sulfates and uses cocamidopropyl betaine to gently cleanse hair, according to the brand. It’s a favorite of NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio, who uses this when she needs to add volume to her fine, wavy hair. “Post-shower, my hair feels bouncy and light, and doesn’t feel weighed down,” she says. The shampoo has notes of white musk, Italian lemons and jasmine, which smells amazing, according to Godio.\n\nBest scented: Living Proof Full Shampoo\n\nThe Living Proof Full Shampoo comes recommended by NBC Select contributing editor Bethany Heitman, who notices that it doesn’t leave her hair feeling dry like other volumizing or thickening shampoos. “My hair feels moisturized after using it, while also feeling so much fuller,” she says. “It’s also not overly scented — it has a slight, clean scent that isn’t overpowering or cloying.” She pairs this shampoo with the Living Proof Full Conditioner, and then adds the brand’s thickening blow dry cream before she styles her hair.\n\nBest thickening shampoo: R+Co Bleu Ingenious Thickening Shampoo\n\nAylward pairs the R+Co’s Bleu shampoo with the brand’s Bleu conditioner to add volume to fine hair. The shampoo is made with kelp extract to help boost volume and thickness, and vegetable proteins to strengthen strands, according to R+Co. Aylward also appreciates the product’s chic packaging: “You may be tempted to use [the bottle] as a flower vase when it’s empty,” he says. Aylward also recommends the R+Co thickening spray as his go-to product for fine hair.\n\nBest splurge: Oribe Shampoo for Magnificent Volume\n\nThis higher-end option from Oribe is great for a volume boost, says freelance makeup and hair artist Francesca Maria Alfonso. The shampoo has a weightless formula that has advanced polymers to visibly plump strands, which creates the volume, says Alfonso. Plus, “it smells so luxurious,” she says.\n\nBest budget pick: Ogx Thick & Full Volumizing Shampoo\n\nOgx’s sulfate-free fine hair shampoo has a blend of biotin and collagen, which are naturally-occurring proteins in the body. Reviewers say it makes their hair look thicker and have more volume overall, plus it makes their hair a lot more manageable with fewer tangles and knots. Reviewers say they also love its subtle fragrance (notes of coconut, jasmine and lemon) that lingers in their hair post-shower. The shampoo has a 4.4-star average rating from 10,600 reviews on Amazon.\n\nBest shampoo bar: Lush Shampoo Bar\n\nLush Shampoo Bar $ 16.00 Lush What we like Soothes scalp irritation\n\nSoftens hair\n\nAdds shine Something to note Small size\n\nAlfonso loves this affordable volumizing shampoo bar for its natural ingredients like clove, cinnamon, peppermint and rosemary. “[These ingredients] not only stimulate your scalp and roots, but they also promote shiny and soft hair,” she says. Plus, its bar formulation means less plastic ending up in the trash.\n\nBest for curly hair: Odele Volumizing Shampoo\n\nI have fine, curly hair and have been searching for a shampoo that will hydrate my hair while keeping it from looking oily. I purchased this Odele shampoo after trichologist Taylor Rose recommended it to me in our guide to the best drugstore shampoos. It’s been a real game-changer: The shampoo makes my hair feel cleansed and nourished without stripping it of too much oil. My curls end up bouncy and free, rather than weighed down, too. Godio is also a fan of this shampoo: “My fine hair always falls flat the day after washing it, but this shampoo helps me avoid that entirely,” she says. “It adds a great amount of volume, so it’s much more manageable and easier to style.” It’s only $12, but it feels high-end.\n\nBest for repair: Suite Reyad The Shampoo Fine & Normal Hair\n\nAlthough NBC Select associate reporter Bianca Alvarez doesn’t have fine hair, she loves using this shampoo because it gently cleanses while adding body, shine and volume. “When I’m giving myself an at-home blowout, I reach for this because of how volumizing it is,” she says. “Plus, I love that it also helps repair any damage without me having to do anything extra.” The shampoo, which is suitable for fine to normal hair textures, can help strengthen hair, too, according to the brand.\n\nBest for oily scalps: Crown Affair The Volumizing Shampoo\n\nThis shampoo, which has a 4.9-star average rating from over 170 reviews at Sephora, is great for those with oily scalps and fine hair because it uses coconut-based surfactants and rice protein to remove buildup, add volume and leave your hair looking thicker and hydrated, according to the brand. Reviewers say they love that they don’t have to double cleanse or wash as frequently when using this shampoo, even if they have extremely oily scalps.\n\nBest for strengthening: Verb Body Boosting Volume Shampoo\n\nOne of Verb’s newest releases is this lightweight volumizing shampoo, which reviewers say is excellent for smoother, healthier and fuller hair. It has three main ingredients: biotin (to strengthen hair), amaranth extract (to make the hair appear fuller) and hibiscus extract (to condition and nourish it), according to the brand. It has a 4.8-star average rating from over 80 reviews at Sephora.\n\nWhat to know about fine hair shampoos\n\nWhen shopping for a quality fine hair shampoo, avoid moisturizing or smoothing products because they tend to have ingredients that can weigh the hair down, says Caspara. Instead, “opt for gentle cleansers and lightweight conditioners that aren’t trying to oversell on the moisturizing capability,” she says. Ingredients are typically listed in proportion, so if heavy oils like avocado or shea butter appear amongst the first few ingredients, fine-haired shoppers beware.\n\nBuyers should also be aware of shampoo labels that may conflate “fine” hair with “thin” hair, when they’re two completely different things, says Aylward. (If you’re experiencing hair loss, consult our guide to the best shampoo for thinning hair). The term “thin” refers to the number of hairs per square inch, while “fine” refers to the diameter of each individual hair, experts say.\n\n“Think of it as the number of trees per acre versus the size of each tree,” says Aylward. That said, “the thinner and finer the hair, the more sensitive the scalp is as it lacks the same protection and coverage thicker hair provides,” says Caspara.\n\nHow to shop for a fine hair shampoo\n\nThose with fine hair are caught in a bind: they’re desperate to suds up their scalp to remove any excess oil, but don’t want to leave their ends high and dry. Here’s what to look for in a fine hair shampoo to keep your hair clean, healthy and bouncy:\n\nGentle cleansers: Fine hair gets greasy easily between washes. Look for safe and effective, yet gentle cleansers, like sodium lauryl sarcosinate or cocamidopropyl betaine, says Caspara. Gentler cleaners should prevent any irritation and dryness on the scalp while removing any excess oil from the hair. If you still have questions about your shampoo or how often you should wash, consult your hairstylist.\n\nFine hair gets greasy easily between washes.

If you still have questions about your shampoo or how often you should wash, consult your hairstylist. Lightweight hydration: If a hair care brand is boasting about the hydrating properties of its fine hair shampoo, Caspara recommends looking elsewhere. That doesn’t mean you can’t find shampoo for fine hair with hydrating ingredients — there are a plethora of ingredients that hydrate hair without weighing it down. For example, multiple options on this list offer seed or fruit oil extracts, like Moringa seed (Oribe) or palmetto berry extract (R+Co).\n\nWhat to avoid if you have fine hair\n\nBelow, I list some things you should avoid while shopping for fine hair shampoos, according to our hair experts.\n\nHarsh cleansers: “Harsh cleansers such as sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate (SLS) can irritate the scalp and affect hair growth over time,” says Caspara. Not all stylists are in agreement on sulfates, however. Some experts told us that sulfates won’t dry out your hair if used in moderation. But for fine hair, look for shampoos without sulfates since they’re gentler on the scalp, and people with fine hair don’t have the same protection that thicker hair provides, says Caspara.\n\n“Harsh cleansers such as sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate (SLS) can irritate the scalp and affect hair growth over time,” says Caspara.

Too much conditioner: While fine hair shampoo can be helpful for bounce and volume, the most important thing you can do is rinse out any and all conditioner, or avoid using too much in the first place to avoid flattening the hair. “Don’t put conditioner from scalp to ends. Just focus on the very ends,” says Alfonso, adding that you can also skip conditioner if you want the most volume without your hair feeling super brittle. Also, rinse your hair with cool water for “bouncy volume,” she says.\n\nWhile fine hair shampoo can be helpful for bounce and volume, the most important thing you can do is rinse out any and all conditioner, or avoid using too much in the first place to avoid flattening the hair. “Don’t put conditioner from scalp to ends.

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "By Janelle Griffith and Claretta Bellamy\n\nMarch 20, 2025\n\nProtests from conservatives and a new president in the White House who describes diversity initiatives as “ illegal and immoral ” have cleared the runway for private companies to roll back or completely abandon diversity, equity and inclusion commitments. Companies, including Target, Walmart, McDonald’s and Amazon, announced plans to scale back or cut DEI programs in their businesses, signaling to some Black customers that it’s time to rethink where they spend their cash.\n\n\n\nNBC News spoke to nearly two dozen Black people across the country about why they are boycotting certain companies and the impact that changes to DEI initiatives have had on their spending habits.\n\n\n\nWalmart did not respond to requests for comment about the boycotts. Target declined to comment about the boycotts or the feelings expressed by people who spoke to NBC News. It referred NBC News to a fact sheet about its “belonging” strategy . Amazon said the company is “committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company that helps us build the best range of products and services for our broad customer base.” McDonald’s declined to comment and referred NBC News to the company's commitment to inclusion .\n\n\n\nThe protest isn’t just about DEI, said Trevon Logan, a professor of economics at Ohio State University. The abandonment of corporate pledges five years after the protests sparked by George Floyd's murder in 2020 is also motivating boycotts.\n\n\n\n“Many of the companies that are being targeted are not just companies that derive a significant share of their business from Black customers; they're also companies that employ a large number of Black people,” he said, “who would be in environments where DEI policies could make their work environments safer, better and more productive.”\n\n\n\nBlack Americans have a collective $1.3 trillion in annual purchasing power , according to some estimates. The total purchasing power of U.S. consumers is more than $17 trillion, said Vicki Bogan, a professor of public policy at Duke University.\n\n\n\nBoth economists said that for the boycotts to have a marked impact, they will have to be sustained and reach beyond Black consumers.\n\n\n\n“If there is buy-in from other communities, then I think there could be enough pressure to change the corporate behavior in a shorter amount of time,” Bogan said.\n\n\n\nWhile Black shoppers aren’t the only people boycotting, Logan pointed to organizing “stemming from Black religious institutions.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Second Measure data, a grassroots “economic blackout” on Feb. 28 had no discernible effect on overall U.S. consumer spending or spending at major retailers. Even with limited impact, Bogan said, the one-day blackout was “successful in raising awareness for this cause.”\n\n\n\nNonetheless, many of the people who spoke to NBC News said they are committed to shopping locally, buying from Black-owned stores when possible and avoiding the box stores that are dropping DEI in the long term.",

        "content": "For the first time since the NCAA began hosting a women’s basketball tournament in 1982, a deep run through the bracket will produce more than bragging rights or a championship banner.\n\nMoney is on the line, too.\n\nEvery game that a school plays between the First Four through the Final Four — making the championship game doesn’t count — will earn what the NCAA calls a “unit,” essentially one slice of the annual television revenue brought in from the NCAA’s media rights deal to broadcast the tournament. All units earned by a conference’s members during a women’s tournament will be paid by the NCAA to the conference, which then splits up the pool of money and redistributes it back to the schools over the next three years.\n\nAt stake this year are 132 units worth a combined $15 million, meaning that if No. 1 overall seed UCLA advances to the championship game, it would earn the Big Ten conference $1.3 million to be paid out through 2028. (Conferences use different methods to decide which schools receive how much.) That pool available for tournament teams will grow to $20 million in 2026, $25 million in 2027 and increase by 2.9% annually after that, the same rate as other Division I funds.\n\nThere’s a reason why the NCAA landed on this unit-based system: It is the same one that’s been used to reward men’s teams in the NCAA Tournament since 1991.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2018, the combined units earned by men’s teams from the Big Ten Conference alone raked in an estimated $340 million, according to a 2019 analysis by The Associated Press.\n\nDuring the same span, meanwhile, women’s basketball teams including powerhouses Connecticut, Tennessee and South Carolina earned zilch.\n\nAmong the numerous books on sports written by Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College, is 1999’s “Unpaid Professionals: Commercialism and Conflict in Big-Time College Sports,” in which he argued for the NCAA to adopt a unit-based payment system for women’s basketball. Zimbalist told NBC News that when Myles Brand was the NCAA president from 2003 to 2009, he had spoken with Brand about fixing what he called the discriminatory disparity that saw men’s teams, but not their women’s counterparts, paid for their performance.\n\n“It never had any justification,” Zimbalist said.\n\nWhy did it take 34 years to fix? The longtime argument against such a move — that the men’s tournament drew more viewers and was thus more valuable — ignored that the women’s tournament nonetheless also drew millions of viewers as well, and could have drawn even more had it been marketed equally to the men’s, Zimbalist said.\n\n“It never would have made any sense to say that women should get paid zero, because the women in fact were attracting customers and revenue,” he said.\n\nThat 34-year gap between the first tournament payouts for men and women was why in January, when an NCAA council approved a fund to start the payments, Danielle Donehew, the executive director of the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association, called it a “momentous victory” that was “the culmination of decades of hard work.”\n\nThat victory arrived, in part, because of pressure. In 2021, women’s basketball players taking part in the NCAA Tournament documented on social media the disparities in how they were treated compared to the men, ranging from paltry weight rooms to meager gift bags. With players agitating for equal treatment and the public asking questions, the NCAA hired a law firm to conduct a gender equity assessment. The findings, released in 2021, were scathing.\n\n“The NCAA’s broadcast agreements, corporate sponsorship contracts, distribution of revenue, organizational structure, and culture all prioritize Division I men’s basketball over everything else in ways that create, normalize, and perpetuate gender inequities,” wrote the firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP.\n\nThe NCAA instituted a few changes immediately, such as allowing the women’s tournament to finally use “March Madness” in its marketing, after previously limiting its use solely to the men’s tournament. Four years after the Kaplan report, there were indications last summer that unit-based payouts were coming to women’s basketball. And when they were officially approved in January, the NCAA attempted to reward women according a standard equal to or better than the men, whose units earnings are paid out over a six-year period.\n\nThe fund that pays out units in the women’s basketball tournament is capped at $15 million this year because it represents 26% of the NCAA’s annual revenue from the media rights deal it inked with ESPN to broadcast the women’s tournament, the same percentage men’s teams drew in 1991. Men’s teams in the tournament currently take in a slightly lower percentage of annual revenue, about 24%.\n\nStill, the total pool of money available to be earned by men’s teams in the tournament this year is over $200 million more than the women’s pool. Where a unit in the women’s tournament will be valued at around $114,000 this year, a unit in the men’s tournament is worth around $2 million.\n\nThe reason? Television.\n\nIt wasn’t a coincidence that men’s teams began earning payouts in 1991; that year, CBS began a six-year agreement, valued at $1 billion at the time, to exclusively broadcast the men’s tournament.\n\nRevenue from the rights to broadcast the Division I men’s basketball tournament have skyrocketed since. Last year alone, the NCAA’s deal granting CBS and Turner the rights to broadcast the men’s basketball tournament brought in $950 million — the lion’s share of the NCAA’s $1.3 billion in revenue, according to financial statements. Next year, the deal alone will pay the NCAA more than $1 billion — bringing in more in one year than the NCAA will be paid over the entire life of its current eight-year, $920 million contract with ESPN to air the women’s basketball tournament along with the championships of more than 20 other NCAA sports.\n\nThe NCAA could have broken off the women’s basketball tournament into its own media rights deal, but opted to keep it as part of a larger package. The women’s tournament portion of that package is valued at about $65 million annually, NCAA President Charlie Baker told the AP last year.\n\n“Yes, it’s a bundle,” Baker said at the time, “but it’s a bigger bundle and it’s a bigger bundle that will be much better.”\n\nFueled by the popularity of then-Iowa superstar Caitlin Clark facing dynastic South Carolina, last year’s women’s NCAA championship game drew a record 18.7 million viewers — 4 million more than the men’s title game, making it the most watched basketball game since 2019, including the NBA.\n\nCaitlin Clark of the Iowa Hawkeyes in a game against Colorado on March 30, 2024, in Albany, N.Y. Andy Lyons / Getty Images file\n\n“If you want to go back to this historical argument and say, ‘Oh, we should remunerate based upon the value that they create,’ then women should be getting paid more this year than the men, not 1/15th the value of the men,” Zimbalist said. “To me, it’s highway robbery. It’s the worst example of exploitation of women that you can imagine. So they wait 34 years, and then they finally give them crumbs. And I don’t know what Charlie Baker thinks he’s doing, but I think it’s totally unacceptable.”\n\nWhether the enormous difference in the value of units between the men’s and women’s tournaments can be narrowed won’t be known until 2032, when the media rights deals for both tournaments next come up for bidding. Packaging the women’s basketball tournament in that bundle with other NCAA championships undervalued the women’s tournament, according to the 2021 Kaplan report, whose analysis suggested the rights for the women’s basketball tournament alone could have sold for $81-$112 million in 2025. Yet the NCAA opted to keep women’s basketball as part of that larger bundle when it reupped its deal with ESPN last year.\n\n“The ultimate question would have been in the NCAA’s mind and their consultants’ mind is, ‘OK, if we sell the NCAA women’s tournament with all the other events, we’re going to get X. If we sell the women’s tournament alone and the other championship events, we’re going to get X plus Y. Well, is that number going to be bigger than if we just sold them all together?’” said Bob Thompson, a former television executive at Fox Sports who now runs his own consulting firm, Thompson Sports Group.\n\n“And they could face the possibility that someone would say, ‘I want the women’s tournament, I don’t want anything else,’ and then those events, they’re sort of sitting there off by themselves, and is anybody going to really go after them? And for the NCAA, it’s extremely important that those events see the light of day and are on television, and is on as broad-based television as possible, which is why I think they’re very happy with the ESPN deal and putting the entirety of it on ESPN.”\n\nExperts are watching to see in the future whether the NCAA will spin off the women’s tournament into its own media rights package, combine it with the men’s tournament or keep it in a bundle.\n\nWithin women’s basketball, the drastic difference in value between men’s and women’s payouts is noted. But having them at all, starting this year, was described by Duke coach Kara Lawson in January as a “step forward that is really valuable.”\n\n“If your sport proves itself to be a moneymaker in this environment,” Lawson said, “all of the constituents of that sport get rewarded.”",

        "content": "While the men’s NCAA Tournament may have been light on first-round upsets, the upshot is the second round is filled with matchups between top teams. All the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds playing Sunday are still alive as schools battle for a spot in the Sweet 16.\n\nHere’s a rundown of the upcoming second-round action.\n\nNo. 8 Connecticut vs. No. 1 Florida (12:10 p.m. ET)\n\nThe Gators (-9.5 spread according to BetMGM) are a considerable favorite against the Huskies. Both of these teams excel at slowing down opposing offenses, in particular Florida, which held opponents to only 40% shooting in the regular season. Connecticut will also have to find an answer for Gators guard Walter Clayton Jr., a Naismith Trophy semifinalist who can rack up points in a hurry.\n\nNo. 9 Baylor vs. No. 1 Duke (2:40 p.m. ET)\n\nThis will be an exciting matchup for fans who also have an eye on the NBA Draft. There are several players in this game who are projected to be selected as high as the top 10 come June, including Duke’s Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel and Khaman Maluach, and Baylor’s V.J. Edgecombe. The showdown between Flagg and Edgecombe is especially tantalizing, as Flagg is the consensus top player in college while Edgecombe is widely considered to be the fourth-best pro prospect. Will the Bears have enough firepower outside of Edgecombe to keep up with the Blue Devils?\n\nNo. 6 Illinois vs. No. 3 Kentucky (5:15 p.m. ET)\n\nThe Fighting Illini are slightly favored in this contest despite entering as the lower seed. This projects to be a close game, as the teams are pretty evenly matched, specifically on the offensive end. The Wildcats finished the regular season ranked 12th in adjusted offensive efficiency, while Illinois finished 13th. Both squads are coming off double-digit wins in the opening round.\n\nNo. 7 St. Mary’s vs. No. 2 Alabama (6:10 p.m. ET)\n\nAre the Crimson Tide primed for an upset? Or did they learn their lesson after the first round? Alabama was on upset watch against No. 15 Robert Morris in the first round, trailing deep in the second half before ultimately pulling away. St. Mary’s, to be fair, had its own challenges to start the tournament, eeking out a three-point win against Vanderbilt. The big challenge for the Gaels in this one will be trying to slow down Crimson Tide senior guard Mark Sears, an experienced scorer who won’t be afraid of the moment.\n\nNo. 12 Colorado State vs. No. 4 Maryland (7:10 p.m. ET)\n\nThe Rams upset the Memphis Tigers to tip off the tourney, and now face a Terrapins team that was 11-1 in non-conference play in the regular season. The tension point in this matchup will be if Colorado State can drag Maryland down into the mud. The Terrapins were much better offensively this season, averaging 81.6 points per game compared to the Rams’ 67.2.\n\nNo. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 3 Iowa State (7:45 p.m. ET)\n\nThe Cyclones enter this game coming off a truly dominant performance in the Round of 64, defeating Lipscomb 82-55, where as the Rebels had to hold off a late comeback attempt from North Carolina. Iowa State lost only once to a non-conference opponent this season, and its offense is more finely tuned operation compared to Ole Miss. The Cyclones scored more, assisted more, and were more efficient than the Rebels leading up to the tournament.\n\nNo. 10 New Mexico vs. No. 2 Michigan State (8:40 p.m. ET)\n\nThis will be a clash of styles in the second round. The Lobos want to play fast and force opponents into a shootout. The Spartans, conversely, bring almost a Big Ten-football mentality to the court, trying to stilt the flow of the game by defending and rebounding well. Michigan State is the more talented team and will be significantly favored, but New Mexico will have a chance if it can ratchet up the pace of the game.\n\nNo. 5 Oregon vs. No. 4 Arizona (9:40 p.m. ET)\n\nThe former Pac-12 foes (RIP) will face off Sunday as non-conference opponents, with the Ducks now members of the Big Ten and the Wildcats representing the Big 12. Both teams are coming off big wins in the opening round. Arizona is slightly favored in this one, thanks largely to its one-two punch of Caleb Love and Jaden Bradley in the backcourt. Oregon will likely need a varied, balanced offensive attack to pull off the upset.",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers, although recent research suggests that the United States is backsliding in efforts to detect the disease early, when it is most curable.\n\nA new study shows that the percentage of women screened for cervical cancer fell from 47% in 2019 to 41% in 2023.\n\nRural women are 25% more likely to be diagnosed and 42% more likely to die from cervical cancer than women who live in cities, a trend that likely reflects lower screening rates in less populated areas, according to the study, published in JAMA Network Open this month.\n\nEvery year, 13,000 women in the U.S. are diagnosed with cervical cancer, which is almost always caused by HPV, or human papillomavirus. About 4,320 die each year, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nCervical cancer rates have been edging upward among women in their 30s and early 40s, perhaps because women ages 21 to 29 are the least likely to be up to date on their screenings, with 29% being overdue.\n\nCervical cancer takes several years to develop, progressing from abnormal cell changes and precancers before transforming into cancer. Studies show that women are also less likely to be screened if they are nonwhite, uninsured or identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual.\n\nHPV vaccines are safe and can prevent 90% of cervical cancers. Yet resistance to the vaccine, which protects against cancer-causing strains of the sexually transmitted infection, has persisted since it was approved almost 20 years ago. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has disparaged them as dangerous, linking HPV shots to autoimmune conditions and mental illness.\n\nA federal judge in North Carolina on March 10 dismissed legal claims that the HPV shot, sold by Merck as Gardasil, could cause patients to develop certain health conditions.\n\nAnother lawsuit alleging that Gardasil causes serious side effects has been put on hold until September because of Kennedy’s involvement in the case. Although Kennedy disclosed in an ethics statement that he stood to receive referral fees from one of the law firms suing Merck, he later said he would give any earnings to his son.\n\nVaccine hesitancy has kept many parents from vaccinating their children. Only 61% of adolescents are up to date on all HPV vaccines, given as a series of two or three shots depending on age.\n\nMore than 42 million people in the U.S. carry at least one strain of HPV that can cause disease, including genital warts or cancer, and 47,00 a year are diagnosed with an HPV-linked malignancy. Yet research has found a decline in awareness that HPV is linked with a number of cancers, including cervical, throat and anal.\n\nWith so many people at risk, we asked experts to help clear up confusion over HPV vaccination and screening.\n\nHow often should women be screened for cervical cancer?\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends that people have a primary HPV test every five years from ages 25 to 65. If primary HPV testing is not available, the society recommends either combining an HPV test with a Pap test every five years or a Pap test alone every three years\n\nHow have HPV vaccines affected rates of cervical cancer and precancer?\n\nAmong women ages 20 to 24 — who were eligible for HPV shots as adolescents — the incidence of cervical precancer fell nearly 80% from 2008 to 2002, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cervical cancer incidence fell 65% from 2012 to 2019 among women under 25. Death rates from cervical cancer among the same age group fell 62% from 2013-2015 to 2019-2021.\n\nHow common is HPV?\n\nHPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. Among sexually active people, more than 90% of men and 80% of women are infected with HPV during their lifetimes. About half of HPV infections involve high-risk strains. In addition to cervical cancer, HPV can cause cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis and head and neck.\n\nGiven how common these viruses are, no one should feel embarrassed to learn they have HPV, said Dr. Rebecca Perkins, an obstetrician-gynecologist and investigator at the Woman, Mother and Baby Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center. “We need to decrease the stigma associated with having a positive test,” Perkins said.\n\nWhat does it mean if a test shows you have high-risk HPV?\n\nAlthough there are more than 200 types of HPV, only a few cause cancer. These types are known as high-risk strains and are included in routine cervical cancer screenings, because they have the highest chance of causing cancer, said Dr. Verda Hicks, immediate past president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. “If an HPV test is positive for high-risk HPV, it indicates an active infection that increases the risk for development of a pre-cancer or cancer,” Hicks said.\n\nDoes being infected with high-risk HPV give you a high risk of cancer?\n\nA. No. The immune system clears most HPV infections within a year or two, Hicks said. Most people with high-risk HPV experience short-term infections that cause mild changes in cervical cells, which return to normal once the infection clears.\n\nDoctors become more concerned if someone tests positive for high-risk HPV for longer than two years as persistent infections can lead to the development of a precancer or cancer. About 1% of people with HPV develop a “long-term, chronic infection” and even fewer develop cervical cancer, Hicks said.\n\n“Women should not freak out” just because they have high-risk HPV, Hicks said. A positive test “means the screening process is doing its job. It is identifying someone who possibly has a persistent infection.”\n\nUndergoing routine screenings and any recommended follow-up tests allow doctors to catch these changes early, when they’re easier to treat, Perkins said.\n\nThat’s why it’s essential not to skip any checkups, she said.\n\n“The longer that someone remains positive, the higher the risk” of developing cancer, Perkins said.\n\nHow common are high-risk HPV infections?\n\nAmong women screened for the first time in their 20s and 30s, up to 20% learn that they have high-risk HPV, said Dr. Mark Einstein, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and women’s health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\nWhat should people with high-risk HPV infections do?\n\nThere’s no blanket prescription for people with high-risk HPV, said Hicks, who noted that doctors tailor their advice for each individual, depending on a variety of risk factors.\n\nWhile people with high-risk HPV shouldn’t panic, they should take the finding seriously, follow their doctor’s advice and attend any recommended follow-up visits, she said. These visits allow doctors to look for abnormal cells, which can be removed before they turn into cancer.\n\nCan people who were vaccinated against HPV still test positive?\n\nYes. That’s because the original HPV shots, which were approved for children and adolescents in 2006, protected against the two riskiest viral strains, which together cause 70% of cervical cancer, as well as two strains that cause genital warts. Although the first HPV vaccines were very effective, people who were vaccinated with them could be infected with one of the HPV strains that cause the other 30% of cervical cancers, Perkins said. Updated HPV shots now protect against nine strains of the virus and protect against 90% of cervical and anal cancers, as well as most strains that cause mouth and throat cancers.\n\nCan you test positive for high-risk HPV years after being infected?\n\nYes. A positive HPV test doesn’t necessarily reflect a recent infection.\n\nAlthough the immune system usually does a good job of controlling HPV, the virus doesn’t disappear from the body. HPV can sometimes reactivate, especially if a person’s immune system has been under stress due to an illness or certain medications, Perkins said.\n\n“We see reactivations in women who have not been sexually active in 10 years,” Perkins said. “It’s just a function of the virus escaping the immune system. You should never get a divorce over a diagnosis of HPV.”\n\nIn some ways, HPV is similar to the chickenpox virus, which can hide in nerve cells for decades before reactivating and causing a painful condition called shingles.\n\n“It doesn’t matter whether the infection is old or new; we still need to follow up,” Perkins said.\n\nIs there a cure for HPV?\n\nThere’s no cure for the virus itself. Health professionals can remove abnormal growths on the cervix, as well as genital warts.",

        "content": "Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Tesla showroom in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan today as a part of the “Tesla Takedown” movement.\n\nFor weeks now, protests have been organized by groups including Action Network, People Over Profits and Disruption Project to denounce Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his involvement in the federal government.\n\nMany of the protesters said they are targeting the business that made Musk the richest man in the world. Forbes estimates his net worth to be just under $200 billion.\n\n“If we can go ahead and continue to protest Tesla as strong as we possibly can and let the world know it’s a toxic brand that fuels him, that’s when you start putting pressure on someone. When you control his money, you control him,” said Mark, a protester who was not willing to share his full name out of fear for his safety.\n\nKarin Schall brought chalk to the protest and used the word “STOP” already painted on the asphalt to write “STOP ELON AND DOGE” — the acronym for Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n“We’re here and the movement is growing because Elon Musk is an unelected person in D.C. right now. He doesn’t have an office and he doesn’t have an email so we can’t go there to voice our issues and concerns, so we have to show up at his point of business, and one of his places of business is Tesla,” Schall said.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.\n\nProtesters gather outside a Tesla showroom in New York on Saturday to denounce Elon Musk and DOGE. Maya Eaglin / NBC News\n\nThe push against the electric car company appears to have had real consequences. The company’s stock closed at $248.71 on Friday compared to its 52-week high of $488.54 in December, though it is still valued higher than it was for much of 2024.\n\nMusk spoke at a Tesla all-hands meeting this week and told his employees there are better days ahead. “Hang on to your stock,” he urged his staff.\n\nAside from the peaceful protests across the country, at least 80 reported cases of vandalism or arson of Tesla vehicles have made headlines in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe FBI released a statement addressing the spike in crimes that have led to three people facing federal charges, and said the “criminal actions appear to have been conducted by lone offenders.”\n\nStill, the agency is encouraging the public “to exercise vigilance and to look out for suspicious activity” near and around Tesla dealerships.\n\nSeveral Tesla owners have said they’ve been targeted since Musk endorsed Donald Trump for president and have faced harassment, violence or threats from the public. Others have gotten rid of the vehicles.\n\nDr. Kumait Jaroje, who owns two Teslas, said Saturday that the “peak of the harassment” was the death threats he has received toward him and his family.\n\nHe said someone sent him a comment that “somebody will cut me off and pull up a gun and shoot me and my family.”\n\nJaroje said he’s even had to move his cars away from his home in Massachusetts because he feared for his family’s safety.\n\n“Elon Musk is trying to do something good, I believe, saving the government, cutting down the waste, it’s something good, you know,” he said.\n\nWinsome Pendergrass speaks at a protest outside a Tesla showroom in New York on Saturday. Luigi W Morris\n\n“I don’t agree with everything he’s doing, you know, but at the end of the day, I bought a truck before. It’s a personal choice,” Jaroje said.\n\nWinsome Pendergrass, a speaker at the Saturday’s protest with Planet Over Profit, said she believes all Americans are at risk of losing critical funding and resources thanks to Musk’s efforts.\n\n“We are not going to be silent, we are not going to sit back and allow him to just run over us. We’re going to stand up. We’re going to fight,” Pendergrass said.\n\n“Americans have done it before. … They have shut down the Montgomery Bus Company, so we can shut it down again, and we can shut down all this foolishness that they’re going on with, and we can rebuild an America that is for everyone, America that is inclusive of all of us,” she said.",

        "content": "BEIRUT, Lebanon — Israel struck Lebanon on Saturday in retaliation for rockets targeting Israel, killing six people including a child, in the heaviest exchange of fire since its ceasefire with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah almost four months ago.\n\nThe rockets fired from Lebanon were the second ones launched since December and again sparked concern about whether the ceasefire would hold. In a statement, Hezbollah denied being responsible for the latest attack, saying it was committed to the truce.\n\nIsrael’s army said the intercepted rockets targeted the Israeli town of Metula. An Israeli official said six rockets were fired and three crossed into Israeli territory and were intercepted. The official said Israel could not confirm the identity of the group that fired the rockets.\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it instructed the army to act forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon. Israel’s army said it struck Hezbollah command centers and dozens of rocket launchers.\n\nLebanon’s state-run National News Agency said a strike in the southern village of Touline killed five people, including a child, and wounded 11 others, including two children.\n\nOn Saturday night, Israel again struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. A strike hit a garage in the coastal city of Tyre, the NNA reported, with one person killed and seven wounded. It was the first time the city had been struck since the ceasefire took effect.\n\nAnd a strike on Hawsh al-Sayed Ali village along the border with Syria wounded five people, according to the NNA.\n\nIn a statement, Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam asked the Lebanese military to take all necessary measures in the south but said the country did not want to return to war.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group’s senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.\n\nIsraeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under a ceasefire struck on Nov. 27. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18.\n\nBut Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon, across from communities in northern Israel. It has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.\n\nLebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw from the country. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes pound Gaza\n\nThe strikes came a day after Israel said it would carry out operations in Gaza “with increasing intensity” until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed to be alive.\n\nIsraeli strikes on Friday night killed at least nine people, including three children, in a house in Gaza City, according to Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the bodies.\n\n“Rubble and glass started falling on us,” said Sameh al-Mashharawi, who lost his brother in the attack. He mourned with his young nephew Samir al-Mashharawi, whose parents and siblings were killed. The 12-year-old, his head and wrists bandaged, sat in the back of a truck and cried.\n\nIsrael’s military said Friday its forces were planning fresh assaults into three neighborhoods west of Gaza City and issued warnings on social media for Palestinians to evacuate the areas.\n\n“Hamas, unfortunately, understands military pressure,” Netanyahu’s foreign policy advisor Ophir Falk told The Associated Press.\n\nAround 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel relaunched the war earlier this week. Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel, and humanitarian aid to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas over ceasefire negotiations.\n\nPalestinians fleeing Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip on Friday. BASHAR TALEB / AFP - Getty Images\n\nThe international community has condemned the resumed attacks.\n\nThe initial 2023 attack by Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.\n\nIsrael’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nTens of thousands of Israelis on Saturday again protested both the government’s failure to negotiate a hostage deal and its move to fire the head of the country’s Shin Bet internal security service. They called for new elections.\n\nThe Supreme Court has ordered a temporary halt to Ronen Bar’s dismissal until an appeal is heard. Israel’s attorney general has ruled that the Cabinet has no legal basis to dismiss him.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid called for a tax rebellion and general strike if the government defies the ruling, saying: “If this happens, the entire country needs to grind to a halt.”",

        "content": "A beloved bald eagle who gained popularity for incubating a rock in 2023 was being mourned Saturday after the 33-year-old avian died following intense storms that recently moved through Missouri.\n\nMurphy, who surpassed the average life span of 25 years, died last week at the World Bird Sanctuary in Valley Park, Missouri. Sanctuary officials believe the violent storms that ripped apart homes and claimed 12 lives last weekend may have factored in the bird’s death.\n\nThey said birds have access to shelters where they can weather storms and the sanctuary has contingency plans for different environmental situations. But evacuations weren’t performed since no tornadoes approached the sanctuary. Three other birds who were in the same shelter with Murphy survived.\n\nA veterinarian performed a necropsy and found the bald eagle sustained head trauma. “We are unable to determine if Murphy was spooked by something and hit his head while jumping off a perch or if wind and precipitation played a part in the injury,” a statement shared by the sanctuary on social media said.\n\nMurphy lived in the sanctuary’s Avian Avenue exhibit area and rose to prominence in 2023 when he incubated a rock. His instincts were rewarded when he was allowed to foster an injured eaglet that he nurtured back to health. The eaglet was eventually released back to the wild and another eaglet was entrusted to Murphy’s care. The second eaglet is expected to be released into the wild this summer.\n\n“In honor of Murphy’s legacy, we plan to name the eventual eagle fostering aviary Murphy’s Manor, so that we can continue to remember him for decades to come,” the sanctuary’s statement added.",

He is expected to appear at noon on the 10th-floor balcony of Rome’s Gemelli hospital, where he has been staying, to greet the crowd and to impart a traditional Sunday blessing, Matteo Bruni, the Vatican spokesman, said at a news conference on Saturday.\n\nThe announcement of the pope’s coming release made for a remarkable turn of events for the leader of the world’s nearly 1.4 billion Roman Catholics, after weeks in which he lay in critical condition and the Roman Catholic Church seemed on the brink of a conclave to pick his successor. Instead, Francis’ steady, if slow, improvement has ushered in a new phase for him and the church.\n\nHe will return to the Vatican, physically diminished, at least in the short term, without his voice, reliant on oxygen and deprived of closeness to the faithful, which has been the hallmark of his pontificate and the manifestation of his pastoral vision for the church.",

Other staff might overhear the sessions, or appear on the patient’s screen as they passed on their way to the bathroom and break room.\n\nThe psychiatrist was stunned. Her patients suffered from disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Treating them from her home office, it had taken many months to earn their trust. This new arrangement, she said, violated a core ethical tenet of mental health care: the guarantee of privacy.\n\nWhen the doctor asked how she was expected to safeguard patient privacy, a supervisor suggested she purchase privacy screens and a white noise machine. “I’m ready to walk away if it comes to it,” she wrote to her manager, in a text message shared with The New York Times. “I get it,” the manager replied. “Many of us are ready to walk away.”",

The Golden Bears entered the matchup ranked 13th nationally in effective field-goal percentage and 10th in made 3s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bulldogs were more than up to the challenge. Mississippi State conceded the first point of the game but then immediately took control with a 9-1 run and limited Cal to five first-quarter points. It was the Golden Bears’ lowest-scoring period of the season. The Bulldogs led for the remainder of the game, holding Cal to 25 percent shooting and three made 3-pointers in the 59-46 win. No. 9 seed Mississippi State advances to play No. 1 seed USC in Monday’s second round.\n\nAlthough they are known for their 3s, Cal’s advantage in many matchups has been Michelle Onyiah. She carves out space in the middle and sucks defenses into the paint, creating space on the perimeter for Cal’s shooters. However, the Bulldogs countered Onyiah with 6-foot-6 center Madina Okot, who guarded 6-3 Onyiah in isolation and won that matchup. Okot was credited with two blocks, but she affected many more shots, as Onyiah missed five layups and the Golden Bears shot 4 of 18 at the rim.\n\nOkot finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds. Jerkaila Jordan had 18 points to lead the Bulldogs, and Eniya Russell also finished in double figures with 13 points.\n\nIn a tournament field littered with potential rematches, Mississippi State is facing the Trojans for the first time in the postseason. The two programs have met twice during the regular season, splitting those games in 2009 and 2016, with each decided by four points.\n\nUSC started its season against the Bulldogs’ rival Ole Miss, eking out a two-point victory in Paris, but it has not played an SEC team since. Mississippi State didn’t play any Big Ten schools during its regular season.\n\n— Sabreena Merchant\n\nNo. 4 Maryland 82, No. 13 Norfolk State 69\n\nTerrapins overcome slow start to advance, face Alabama Monday\n\nWith several players who hadn’t experienced an NCAA Tournament before, Maryland coach Brenda Frese expected some level of tightness when the ball tipped on Saturday. But she didn’t expect it to carry over well into the third quarter, or for that overall tightness to impact the productivity of her best players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, Maryland entered halftime trailing Norfolk State by two with its two leading scorers — Shyanne Sellers and Kaylene Smikle — having combined for just five first-half points on 20 percent shooting and seven combined turnovers (of the team’s 12). Frese knew the Terrapins desperately needed a reset.\n\nShe emphasized pace, ball security and a more connected team mentality. It was just what the Terrapins needed to outlast Norfolk State and it’s also what they will need as they look down its bracket littered with great SEC and ACC teams — ones featuring excellent guard play.\n\nSuffice it to say, the halftime talk worked. In the third quarter — paced by Sellers and Smikle, who combined for 16 third-quarter points, and ended with a combined 33 — the Terrapins settled in and looked much more like the tournament team they hoped to be. Maryland scored as many points in that quarter as it did in the entire first half.\n\n“That’s what we have to have from our guard play if we’re going to continue to move through this tournament — our guards have to show up,” Frese said. “We’re fortunate we found a way to win, but we’re going to have to play a much better game come Monday.”\n\nFrese lauded Norfolk State’s cohesion and attributed it to the many veterans across the roster. When she looks at the Terrapins’ next opponent, she sees the same; Alabama starts three fifth-year players. Even further down the potential path for the Terrapins, though Frese didn’t speak that far ahead on Saturday, a potential matchup looms against top-seeded South Carolina, which starts four players who are at least in their fourth year.\n\nWhen the Terrapins and their guards are at their best, they can hang with those opponents. But, as it hinted on Saturday, when that tightness gets the better of it, Maryland could be vulnerable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’m hopeful, as we move forward,” Frese said, “we can get back to playing the way we’re used to playing.”\n\n— Chantel Jennings\n\nNo. 1 USC 71, No. 16 UNC Greensboro 25\n\nUSC’s full-court press creates a distance\n\nLOS ANGELES — It took about a quarter for USC to find its footing in its first-round matchup. Against one of the slowest-paced teams in Division I (only three teams use fewer possessions per 40 minutes), the Trojans were stuck in the half court for the first 11 minutes, unable to break away from a stout UNC Greensboro defense. Then USC busted out its full-court press, and the entire tenor of the game changed.\n\nThe Trojans reeled off 16 points in a row in the second quarter to extend their lead to 18, forcing five turnovers in the process. The Spartans could barely get the ball past half court, let alone create good shots. The few times they did break the press, they took quick jumpers, playing right into USC’s hands. Meanwhile, the Trojans regained their offensive groove in transition and led by double digits the rest of the way, winning 71-25.\n\nUNC Greensboro’s final total was less than what USC had scored at halftime (28). Through the third quarter, the Spartans were collectively trailing JuJu Watkins. They made 13 percent of their shots (seven total) and committed 23 turnovers.\n\nWatkins finished with 22 points on 8-of-17 shooting in 28 minutes, just the second time in 2025 that she has played fewer than 30. She has scored at least 20 points in all five of her NCAA Tournament games.\n\n— Sabreena Merchant\n\nNo. 10 South Dakota State 74, No. 7 Oklahoma State 68\n\nExperienced Jackrabbits outlast Cowgirls in Storrs\n\nThere’s nothing quite like experience when it comes to March. Saturday, that proved especially true for South Dakota State, which is in its third consecutive NCAA Tournament. The Jackrabbits punched a ticket to the second round with an upset of Oklahoma State behind their starting five, who had combined for 352 career starts coming into the day. It marks the fifth time the Jackrabbits have advanced to the second round, including the second time in three years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Oklahoma State threw a full-court press at SDSU and used fouls to stop the clock down the stretch, the Jackrabbits remained poised as their season hung in the balance. They were nearly perfect from the line in the final minute, knocking down 6 of 8 free throws for the final win margin.\n\nA close game was expected, as it was the only first-round game featuring two teams in the AP Top 25’s final regular-season ranking (Oklahoma State at No. 17, South Dakota State at No. 24). SDSU’s victory was just the second seed-upset of the tournament thus far, as the Jackrabbits became the second mid-major to advance into the second round along with Richmond.\n\nThe Jackrabbits — which entered the postseason ranked top-10 for 3-point percentage — struggled to get their distance shooting going. As the Cowgirls knocked down 10 triples (to the Jackrabbits’ two), South Dakota State relied on dominant rebounding (a 47-29 advantage) to keep Oklahoma State from securing second-chance opportunities.\n\nFollowing a trend of the regular season, the Paige Meyer–Brooklyn Meyer (unrelated) combo powered SDSU to the second round. Paige Meyer tallied 16 points, eight rebounds and six assists, and Brooklyn Meyer added 19 points and eight rebounds. Mesa Byom led all players with 12 rebounds.\n\nThe Jackrabbits will face No. 2 UConn on its home floor (in what is likely Paige Bueckers’ final game in Storrs) on Monday.\n\n— Chantel Jennings\n\nNo. 6 West Virginia 78, No. 11 Columbia 59\n\nWest Virginia’s disruptive defense forces 25 turnovers\n\nWest Virginia has made a habit out of frustrating opponents. Eleventh-seeded Columbia knew that, and yet, it succumbed to the sixth-seeded Mountaineers’ press much like several others this season.\n\nThe Mountaineers forced 25 turnovers — a season high in giveaways for the Lions — in their 78-59 win. Senior guard J.J. Quinerly, the back-to-back Big 12 defensive player of the year, had seven steals, and junior guard Jordan Harrison had three steals. They combined for 50 points as they sliced through the Lions defense on the other end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe turnover margin was the difference. West Virginia scored 28 points off the Lions’ giveaways, compared to 10 points off turnovers for Columbia (even though the Lions forced 21 turnovers themselves).\n\nIt was a vintage defensive performance for the Mountaineers, who entered the tournament second nationally in defensive rating, second in steals per game and second in points off turnovers per game. West Virginia will face either No. 3 North Carolina or No. 14 Oregon State in the second round. Neither will be an easy opponent. But the Mountaineers are experienced and their defense is disruptive. That’s why they have a realistic chance of reaching their first Sweet 16 since 1992.\n\nMade for March 🔥 27 points – 7 steals – 7 assists – 4 rebounds#HailWV | @JJQUINERLY11 pic.twitter.com/I7lJitv4Sk — WVU Women’s Basketball (@WVUWBB) March 23, 2025\n\n— Ben Pickman\n\nNo. 3 Oklahoma 81, No. 14 FGCU 58\n\nBeers shows why she was a coveted transfer last offseason\n\nRaegan Beers was one of the stars of last year’s NCAA Tournament. She led Oregon State to the Elite Eight, its furthest point since 2018. But as the Pac-12 crumbled and the Beavers joined the WCC, Beers transferred to Oklahoma.\n\nShe was first-team All-SEC during her first season with the Sooners. In her NCAA Tournament debut with her new team, she proved she would again imprint games of consequence.\n\nBeers finished with 25 points and 18 rebounds, as a 19-4 run late in the fourth quarter helped No. 3 Oklahoma defeat No. 14 FGCU 81-58.\n\nKey to the victory was Oklahoma’s dominance on the glass. It doubled up FGCU on the boards, 72-35, with four players grabbing at least six rebounds apiece. The Sooners had 27 second-chance points compared to just five for the Eagles.\n\nControlling the glass will be just as consequential for Oklahoma in the Round of 32, as it looks to advance to its first Sweet 16 since 2013. The Sooners will play Iowa, who is 30th in the nation in defensive rebounding percentage. Hawkeyes forward Hannah Stuelke had two early fouls and played only 14 minutes in No. 6 Iowa’s first-round win over Murray State, and freshman center Ava Heiden had 15 points and seven rebounds in 17 minutes. How the front courts fare will go a long way in deciding who advances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n— Ben Pickman\n\nNo. 2 NC State 75, No. 15 Vermont 55\n\nCatamounts can’t mount an upset\n\nA No. 15 seed has never upset a No. 2 seed in the women’s NCAA Tournament, a streak that is still intact as of Saturday afternoon. But through three quarters, NC State seemed like it was dangerously close to making history for all of the wrong reasons against Vermont in Raleigh, N.C.\n\nThe Wolfpack eventually pulled away to win 75-55, but only after they led by just two points at halftime (35-33) and finished the third quarter up just 52-46. Thanks to a fourth-quarter outburst in which the Wolfpack outscored the Catamounts 23-9, NC State is onto Round 2 instead of watching Vermont compete for a spot in the Sweet 16 on their home floor. Coach Wes Moore will surely use this as a teaching moment.\n\nNC State had no answers for guard Keira Hanson, who entered Saturday averaging 9.6 points per game and finished with a game-high 21 fueled by her five 3-pointers. With Wolfpack guard Zoe Brooks finishing with 19 points and Saniya Rivers and Aziaha James both finishing with 15, the Wolfpack had enough to get this one over the finish line, but they’ll surely have to be sharper moving forward. Vermont shot 42 percent from beyond the arc and had 21 bench points to NC State’s nine. Maybe this will be a wakeup call for the Wolfpack, who knows it’s only going to get harder from here. NC State will play the winner of No. 7 seed Michigan State-No. 10 seed Harvard in the second round.\n\n— Grace Raynor\n\nNo. 2 UConn 103, No. 15 Arkansas State 34\n\nFudd, Strong help UConn look like title teams of old\n\nFifteenth-seeded Arkansas State scored the first basket of its first-round game against No. 2 UConn. For 12 seconds, the Red Wolves held the lead. Then, UConn did what UConn does. The Huskies blitzed Arkansas State, scoring 22 consecutive points — with 11 of those coming from Azzi Fudd and 11 from Sarah Strong. UConn’s lead only grew from there.\n\nThe Huskies’ 50-point halftime cushion sent viewers back to the program’s record book. While impressive, UConn’s 66 first-half points were still well off from its NCAA-record 94-point first half against Saint Francis in 2018. Still, the opening 20 minutes on Saturday were reminiscent of UConn teams of old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFudd and Strong were instrumental in the Huskies’ first half. Fudd scored 21 points, one shy of her NCAA Tournament career-high, in 18 minutes. Strong had 15 points, six rebounds, three assists and three blocks in the first half.\n\nStrong finished UConn’s 103-34 win with 20 points, 12 rebounds, five assists and five blocks, becoming the first player in the last 25 years with a 20-10-5-5 performance. Fudd added 27 points, seven assists and six steals. It’s hard to read too much into the blowout victory, but how both perform throughout the tournament will likely be the difference in whether UConn wins its first national title since 2016.\n\nThe 69-point win tied for the seventh-widest margin of victory in the NCAA Tournament (a list in which UConn owns four of the top-seven all-time blowouts).\n\nRank Margin of victory Winner Loser Year 1 89 Baylor 119 Texas Southern 30 2017 2 88 UConn 140 St. Francis (Pa.) 52 2018 3 74 Tennessee 111 North Carolina A&T 37 1994 4 72 Cheyney 107 Monmouth 35 1983 4 72 UConn 101 LIU 29 2001 6 71 UConn 116 Hampton 45 2000 7 69 Duke 96 Southern 27 2006 7 69 UConn 103 Arkansas St. 34 2025\n\nA second-round matchup with either Oklahoma State or South Dakota State awaits.

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "The Athletic has live coverage of 2025 Men’s March Madness\n\nThe list of experiences makes for quite the “One Shining Moment” montage. Outside of UConn’s back-to-back national championships, few men’s college basketball programs have had as much success as the Houston Cougars over the past three seasons — and 12-year-old Jace Abarca basked in much of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was March 2023, when Houston clinched the AAC regular season championship, head coach Kelvin Sampson draping the celebratory, cut-down net around Abarca’s neck. There were trips with his family to watch the Cougars in the Sweet 16 in each of the past two NCAA Tournaments. There were countless practices and games, Abarca in the center of a towering huddle of players or dancing on the sideline during timeouts at the Fertitta Center.\n\nThere was also October 2022, when then-10-year-old Abarca was the focal point of a signing day ceremony, putting pen to paper to become the Coogs’ “lead ball boy” in front of the players, staff, cheerleaders and local media. It was the perfect antidote to lift a struggling kid’s spirits.\n\n“Today, Jace (Abarca) is officially a University of Houston Cougar,” Sampson said that day in 2022. “Great teams are made of great teammates. That was the thing about Jace that jumped out at us right away.”\n\nBut if you ask Abarca about his favorite memory as an honorary member of Houston basketball, he’ll quickly tell you it was the post-practice games of Uno against that towering huddle of players. Emanuel Sharp. J’Wan Roberts. Jamal Shead. LJ Cryer. Ja’Vier Francis. All larger-than-life heroes to Abarca. And losers.\n\n“I dominated in Uno,” he said. “It was a lot of fun.”\n\nThis week, Sampson and the Cougars head to Wichita, Kan. for the opening round of the NCAA Tournament as the No. 1 seed in the Midwest region. The team is hoping, at the very least, for a sixth straight trip to the Sweet 16, and a repeat of 2021’s run to the Final Four, hosted this year just a few hours from campus in San Antonio. Abarca is hoping for it too, back home in Houston and feeling healthy. Finally.\n\nIn 2022, Abarca was diagnosed with lupus and nephrotic syndrome, a serious kidney and autoimmune disease. The prognosis came after months of hospital visits and unanswered questions, a sprightly kid left lethargic and suffering “9 out of 10” on a pain scale. He had to miss the start of his fifth grade year and take steroids that made him bloated, his puffy face almost unrecognizable to himself in the mirror. He couldn’t play sports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“He was just drained, and it was tough seeing that as a dad,” his father James said.\n\nBetween countless hospital visits, Abarca’s mom, Yaneth, got connected with Team IMPACT, a non-profit organization that matches children dealing with significant illnesses and disabilities with college sports programs across the country.\n\nJace Abarca with members of the Houston team. (Photo courtesy of Team IMPACT)\n\nHouston men’s basketball was a natural fit for a family of Cougar fans — James has “been Phi Slamma Jamma since 1984,” he said. Lauren Sampson, Kelvin’s daughter and the team’s director of basketball operations, arranged practice visits and game tickets for Jace and the family, including his three siblings, and organized the signing day ceremony.\n\n“I remember looking over that day and seeing Jace’s mother, and she had these big crocodile tears in her eyes,” Kelvin Sampson told The Athletic. “It just makes you feel good to know you’ve done something to help a kid and family that faced so many tough days. But for that moment, they got to celebrate.”\n\nThe signing day event went above and beyond, but that sentiment — creating fun, happy memories during tough times — is the point of these partnerships.\n\n“Just trying to make his day better,” said Sharp, a junior guard on this year’s team who developed a bond with Jace over those games of Uno and their special slow-motion handshake. “Doing stuff like that puts a smile on his face. It meant a lot seeing him happy, his family happy.”\n\nBut the ultimate goal digs a bit deeper. For a lot of these kids, the universities are often near where they have to go for hospital visits. Turning those trips into something exciting and enjoyable helps alleviate some of that anxiety. And for Abarca, a previously active kid who was struggling with self-esteem due to the treatment and its impact on his body, being embraced by the local standout college hoops team provided a welcome, lasting confidence boost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I never thought something like this sickness would happen to me, but they made me forget all about it,” Abarca said. “They brought energy back to my life.”\n\nThat energy flows both ways. The influence it had on Abarca was obvious, but he’s left a mark on the program as well. Sharp described how seeing what Abarca and his family have gone through put a bad game or a tough week of practice in perspective, and reminded him how even small gestures of kindness — “Taking extra time to be positive and uplifting to other people,” Sharp said — can have an outsized impact.\n\n“Part of our job as coaches, in an era when there is a lot of entitlement, is that at some point, you have to teach your kids to be givers. You have to be willing to do something to help other people,” Sampson said. “Jace created a great learning opportunity for our entire program. Guys who are selfish have a hard time relating to someone who is going through the challenges that Jace faced. But our kids were effusive in their efforts to make Jace feel good. That told me a lot about them.”\n\nThese matches are designed to lift up kids and their families when they need it most. Yet more often than not, those small sacrifices manifest into something more meaningful.\n\n“Jace helped our program by allowing us to help him,” said Sampson.\n\nIt’s why so many of the Team IMPACT relationships extend beyond the organization’s two-year partnership. Why 11-year-old Rylan Ellingwood became the best man at UConn assistant coach Mamadou Diarra’s wedding. And why the entire Kansas basketball team showed up to JP Bemberger’s funeral in January.\n\nAbarca’s two-year match with Houston officially ended after last season. He’s stayed connected to the program since then, though he hasn’t been around quite as much this season — for good reason. Jace is in remission, back to feeling and looking like his old self, his nights and weekends brimming with the various activities of an active, outgoing 12-year-old. There’s no cure for nephrotic syndrome, which is why Abarca still makes regular hospital visits to monitor the disease. It’s something he will have to manage for the rest of his life. But now it comes with an extended support system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“What a beautiful kid,” said Sampson. “He’s part of the team, the family is part of the team.”\n\nThe Abarcas will be rooting like it, cheering on the Coogs this week and ideally beyond. Abarca’s prior trips to the Sweet 16 ended in tough defeats, but this year, he’s got an eye toward San Antonio.\n\n“I’m really hoping,” he said. “That would be amazing.”\n\n(Top photo courtesy of Team IMPACT)",

        "content": "But Kaczynski has also become a kind of crossover figure — and a remarkably post-partisan one, capable of drawing nods from everyone from vaccine-skeptical Republicans to Musk-skeptical Democrats to internet-native teenagers. How many other domestic terrorists have been name-checked in conservatives’ complaints about the erosive effects of social media and also in TikTokers’ videos from a bucolic weekend at the lake? His manifesto, dismissed in the 1990s as impenetrable, is now the subject of YouTube videos drawing millions of views apiece.\n\nIt’s not so hard to understand why. Kaczynski mailed off his manifesto two months before Netscape’s I.P.O., in what were, for many Americans, the last days of the pre-internet era. Thirty years later, we occupy a disorienting moment when the visions of techno-optimists and techno-pessimists alike seem on the verge of realization, when a miraculous future and a dystopian one seem at once within our reach and beyond our control.\n\n‘A Bit of the Unabomber in Most of Us’\n\n“Industrial Society and Its Future” was published by The Times and The Post 30 years ago in September, at the urging of F.B.I. investigators, who wagered that giving in to the bomber’s demand to distribute his manifesto would be worth it if one reader in a million recognized the writing. One did: David Kaczynski, whose tip led federal agents to his brother’s small cabin in the woods outside Lincoln, Mont.\n\nTed Kaczynski was arrested on April 3, 1996, almost a year after the far-right anti-government extremist Timothy McVeigh blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Conservatives had chafed at Democrats’ attempts to link McVeigh’s views to the rhetoric of right-wing talk radio, and as the details of Kaczynski’s life and crimes emerged — Harvard education; a late-1960s teaching stint at the University of California, Berkeley; bombing targets borrowed from an Earth First! publication — they were quick to brand him as the liberals’ McVeigh. Rush Limbaugh proclaimed him “a left-wing nut.” Where were liberals’ “cries against radical extremism,” the conservative columnist Cal Thomas wanted to know, “now that one of their own has been implicated in the horrid deed of bombs by mail?”\n\nBut Kaczynski was not one of their own. His manifesto spent nearly as many words denouncing “leftism” as it did attacking technology. Although environmental degradation infuriated him, it was a distant secondary concern to the loss of personal liberty, which he defined in terms a libertarian would recognize.",

So did Bonnie Garmus, Claudia Rankine, James Patterson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Elin Hilderbrand, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Roxane Gay, Marlon James, Sarah MacLean, Min Jin Lee, Jonathan Lethem and Jenna Bush Hager, to name just a few. And you can also take part! Vote here and let us know what your top 10 books of the century are.\n\nWe hope you’ll discover a book you’ve always meant to read, or encounter a beloved favorite you’d like to pick up again. Above all, we hope you’re as inspired and dazzled as we are by the breadth of subjects, voices, opinions, experiences and imagination represented here.\n\nMy Tally I haven’t read any of these books yet ...

        "content": "When President Trump announced on Friday that the United States would move ahead with a long-debated project to build a stealthy next-generation fighter jet, the message to China was clear: The United States plans to spend tens of billions of dollars over the next decade, probably far longer, to contain Beijing’s ability to dominate the skies over the Pacific.\n\nBut here on earth, the reality has been very different.\n\nAs the Department of Government Efficiency roars through agencies across government, its targets have included some of the organizations that Beijing worried about most, or actively sought to subvert. And, as with much that Elon Musk’s DOGE has dismembered, there has been no published study of the costs and benefits of losing those capabilities — and no discussion of how the roles, arguably as important as a manned fighter, might be replaced.\n\nOn the list of capabilities on life support is Radio Free Asia, a 29-year-old nonprofit that estimates its news broadcasts reach 60 million people in Asia each week, from China to Myanmar, and across the Pacific islands where the United States has been struggling to counter China’s narratives about the world. It furloughed all but 75 of its Washington staff members on Friday, trying to stay on the air while court cases develop on Trump officials’ moves to defund U.S. government-supported media.\n\nAt the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth eliminated the Office of Net Assessment, an internal think-tank. With an annual budget that accounted for a few seconds of Pentagon spending each year, the office tried to think ahead about the challenges the United States would face a decade or two in the future — such as the new capabilities of artificial intelligence, autonomous weapons and the hidden vulnerabilities of supply chains for military contractors.",

        "content": "In the summer of 1993, the movie “Free Willy” — about a captive killer whale that’s heroically set free — was an unexpected hit. But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\n\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\n\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.",

The sweeping nature of the president’s latest demand comes as he has also stepped up his public attacks on judges and the very notion that the courts can tell him what to do or not do.\n\nThe executive branch “should neither fear nor punish those who challenge it and should not be the arbiter of what is frivolous — there are protections in place to address that,” Ms. Gupta said. “This moment calls for courage and collective action, not capitulation, among lawyers and the legal profession.”\n\nIt also comes amid a showdown between a federal judge in Washington and the administration over the president’s invocation a week ago of the Alien Enemies Act, which he used to immediately send more than 100 Venezuelan migrants he said were gang members to a large prison complex in El Salvador.\n\nCivil rights activists say the deportations violated the law, and that the administration’s refusal to give clear answers on its conduct flouts the very premise of the U.S. court system.\n\nOne law firm that is suing the administration over its policies said it would not back down in the face of threats from the White House.",

Columbia’s moves on Friday — revealed in a letter to the campus from the interim president, Dr. Katrina A. Armstrong — were essentially an opening bid in negotiations with the federal government to let the $400 million flow again. But the Trump administration has not publicly said what other concessions it might seek from Columbia or the dozens of other universities, from Hawaii to Harvard, that it has started to scrutinize since taking power on Jan. 20.\n\nIn a letter on Friday, Columbia’s board of trustees said it had used talks with the government to “present Columbia-driven” plans for change. The board also insisted that it was “dedicated to protecting Columbia University’s bedrock principles of academic excellence, open inquiry and the deeply held value of free expression.”\n\nRepublicans have spent decades warring with the elite realms of higher education. But the Trump administration, despite being led by a president who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, has adopted an especially vitriolic and punitive approach.\n\nVice President JD Vance, who holds a degree from Yale’s law school, has branded universities as “the enemy.” Mr. Rufo said recently that it was his mission to master using federal financial support to make colleges feel “an existential terror.”",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "People could decide, Hey, my unhappiness has to do with being raised by emotionally immature parents, and I’ll work on that. Then six months down the line, they realize there’s still a bunch of things they’re unhappy about. So how do we understand what our expectations for happiness should be? If you ever watch little kids, their default mode is happiness, and that’s because they’re spontaneously going and doing the next interesting thing. They naturally are following their energies. I think that’s what happens with people too. If they feel released to say no to the things that kill their energy, if they don’t feel guilted into acting more compassionate or loving than they really feel, if we take these things off of them, it’s like a cork that bobs to the top of the water. The emotionally immature person needs other people to emotionally stabilize them, make them happy, and also to buffer their self-esteem. When we can get the idea that we’re not in this world to function as a sort of auxiliary coping mechanism for people who can’t do it for themselves, we begin to feel our energy coming back. That’s what happiness is. Happiness is like free energy.\n\nEarlier you cautioned against the idea of compassion. At the same time, I want to hold onto the idea that the emotionally immature person, they’re probably struggling. They, too, deserve grace. How do we open the door to the possibility of change and reconciliation and understanding without compassion? Oh, no. I don’t think we should do anything without compassion. But what I’m talking about is that with the people that I work with in psychotherapy, the adult children of these emotionally immature parents, the problem was really an excess of compassion. What I’ve seen is that the compassion takes over the instinctual self-preservation, and the person feels too guilty, too ashamed and too self-doubting to even think about what’s healthy for them.\n\nHow much can people really change? I don’t think there’s much possibility of change unless you have self-reflection, and you have self-reflection because you have a sense of self. You developed a sense of self because your emotional needs have been met and you have been responded to as a human being early enough that that sense of self gets in there. To go back to “The Sopranos,” that’s what his therapist was trying to do. She got Tony to start, in a minuscule way, self-reflecting. That makes change possible. I think there are earth-shattering moments that permanently shift your view of something or your way of thinking. That kind of change can happen in a flash. It’s like a joint goes back into place. There’s a click and it’s like, ah, everything starts to reorganize around that new realization. What I have found, though, is that the biggest change that people seem to have gotten from therapy is that they have a realization of their own inner experience. They now know how things affect them, what they really feel, what they really think, and they use that to guide themselves through relationships and their lives. The insight is not an intellectual exercise. It is like a becoming — an awareness that this is who I am.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Ukraine and Russia have agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after the US president, Donald Trump, spoke with the countries’ leaders last week. But uncertainty remains about how or when the part-ceasefire will take effect as Ukraine and Russia prepare to send delegations to Riyadh this week for parallel talks with the US.\n\nWhat have the US, Russia, and Ukraine actually agreed on so far?\n\nThe three sides offered strikingly different interpretations of the limited ceasefire pact: the White House described it as covering both energy and infrastructure, the Kremlin framed it more narrowly as focused on energy infrastructure, while Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope that it would also include railways and ports.\n\nWhen is the ceasefire supposed to take effect?\n\nThere is also uncertainty on when the ceasefire was meant to go into effect.\n\nFollowing Tuesday’s call with Trump, Vladimir Putin gave the impression that the limited ceasefire would take effect immediately, reportedly ordering his military to stop all strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure.\n\nJust hours later, Ukraine accused Russia of breaking its promises, with Zelenskyy reporting strikes on civilian infrastructure – including a hospital in Sumy. It remains unclear, however, whether Russia also targeted Ukraine’s energy facilities.\n\nAdding to the confusion, Moscow, in turn, accused Kyiv of violating the partial ceasefire, pointing to a strike on an oil depot that occurred before Zelenskyy had officially signed on to the truce.\n\nThe US is expected to push for a firm start date for the limited ceasefire when Ukrainian and Russian delegations hold separate talks with White House officials in Riyadh on Monday.\n\nWhat happens if Russia or Ukraine breaks its word?\n\nUkraine remains deeply sceptical of any Russian agreement, pointing to past instances where Moscow failed to honour its commitments.\n\nZelenskyy’s warning last month in Washington – that Russia cannot be trusted, backed by evidence of more than 25 ceasefire violations – was the initial spark that led to his dressing down by Trump and the vice-president, JD Vance.\n\nThe UK and European leaders have warned that Putin would face serious consequences if he violated a temporary ceasefire agreement. However, their leverage over Moscow remains limited – most sanctions have already been imposed, and Europe continues to struggle with supplying Ukraine with enough weapons to match Russia’s military output.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, is likely to seize on any Ukrainian ceasefire violations – real or fabricated – as a pretext to continue its offensive and pressure Washington into cutting off military support for Kyiv.\n\nCan a limited ceasefire lead to long-term peace?\n\nAt present, the two sides remain far apart on what would be acceptable terms for a peace treaty, with no sign that Putin has relinquished any of his maximalist aims in the war against Ukraine.\n\nUkraine has laid out a step-by-step plan for peace: first, a full and immediate ceasefire, followed by negotiations toward a durable peace deal underpinned by western security guarantees.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, insists that any agreement must be comprehensive from the outset, combining a ceasefire with long-term conditions in a single package – rejecting any phased approach.\n\nMoscow has set out several key conditions for any long-term settlement – most of which are non-starters for Kyiv and its European allies. These include a halt to all foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, restrictions on the size of its armed forces, and international recognition of the four Ukrainian regions Russia illegally annexed following staged referendums in 2022.\n\nThe Kremlin has also signalled it would reject any presence of western troops in Ukraine – something Kyiv views as essential to securing lasting security guarantees.",

        "content": "The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, joined the mounting criticism of federal judges by Donald Trump and others in his administration on Saturday, mocking the judge who blocked a ban on transgender troops in the US military and suggesting she had exceeded her authority.\n\nThe US district judge Ana Reyes in Washington ruled that Trump’s 27 January executive order, one of several issued by the Republican president targeting legal rights for transgender Americans, likely violated the US constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under the law.\n\nHegseth in a post on social media mockingly called the judge “Commander Reyes” and suggested she was abusing her power by making decisions about warfare.\n\n“Since ‘Judge’ Reyes is now a top military planner, she/they can report to Fort Benning at 0600 to instruct our Army Rangers on how to execute High Value Target Raids,” Hegseth wrote. “After that, Commander Reyes can dispatch to Fort Bragg to train our Green Berets on counterinsurgency warfare.”\n\nReyes was appointed by the Democratic former president Joe Biden. There have been rising tensions between Trump’s administration and members of the federal judiciary who have issued rulings impeding some of Trump’s actions since he returned to office in January, and rising concern about the safety of judges.\n\nTrump, his billionaire adviser Elon Musk, the attorney general Pam Bondi and other administration officials have assailed judges in recent weeks. For instance, Trump on Tuesday called for the impeachment of the judge presiding over a legal challenge to deportation flights, calling him a “Radical Left Lunatic” and a “troublemaker and agitator” – prompting the US supreme court chief justice to issue a rare rebuke of the president.\n\nFederal courts are hearing more than 100 lawsuits challenging various initiatives by Trump and his administration, with some judges imposing nationwide injunctions to block policies, such as his move to curtail automatic birthright citizenship.\n\nHegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News television host, has made culture war issues such as banning transgender troops and abolishing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the US military a top priority.\n\nAfter Hegseth took over the Pentagon, Trump also relieved the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, General CQ Brown, who is Black, and the Navy’s top admiral, who was the first woman to hold the position. Hegseth had previously questioned whether Brown only got the job because he was Black.\n\nWhile Trump and Hegseth have broad authority to relieve US military officers, their efforts to ban transgender service members have triggered numerous lawsuits.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Later that month, the military said it would begin expelling transgender members.\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit before Reyes argued the order was illegal, pointing to a 2020 US supreme court ruling that found that employment discrimination against transgender people is a form of illegal sex discrimination.\n\nLawyers for the administration have argued in court that the military is entitled to bar people with certain conditions that make them unsuitable for service, also including bipolar disorder and eating disorders. At a 12 March hearing, they told Reyes she should defer to the judgment of the current administration that transgender people are not fit for service.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "An Orthodox Jewish passenger says a United Airlines pilot forcibly removed him from an airplane bathroom while he was experiencing constipation, exposing his genitalia to other flyers during a flight from Tulum, Mexico, to Houston.\n\nYisroel Liebb, of New Jersey, described his trip through allegedly unfriendly skies in a federal lawsuit this week against the airline and the US Department of Homeland Security, whose officers he said boarded the plane upon landing and took him away in handcuffs.\n\nLiebb and a fellow Orthodox Jewish traveler said they were forced to miss a connecting flight to New York City while US Customs and Border Protection officers paraded them through an airport terminal, placed them in holding cells and searched their luggage.\n\n“CBP Officers responded to reports of a disturbance on a flight at the request of the airline,” said Hilton Beckham, the CBP assistant commissioner for public affairs. “Due to the ongoing litigation, we are unable to provide any further comment.”\n\nUnited Airlines declined to comment. A message seeking comment was left for a lawyer representing Liebb and the other traveler, Jacob Sebbag.\n\nIn the lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, Liebb said he had been in the bathroom in the back of the plane for about 20 minutes on 28 January when a flight attendant woke Sebbag from a nap and asked Sebbag to check on him.\n\nLiebb said he explained his gastrointestinal predicament and assured Sebbag that he would be out soon. Sebbag then relayed that to the flight attendant, the lawsuit says.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, with Liebb still indisposed, the pilot approached Sebbag and asked him to check on Liebb, the lawsuit says. The pilot then yelled at Liebb to leave the bathroom immediately, the lawsuit says.\n\nLiebb said he told the pilot that he was finishing up and would be out momentarily.\n\nThe pilot responded by breaking the lock, forcing the bathroom door open and pulling Liebb out with his pants still around his ankles, exposing his genitalia to Sebbag, flight attendants and nearby passengers, according to the lawsuit.\n\n“The pilot became visibly enraged, broke the lock on the door and forced the door to the bathroom open, pulling Liebb out of the bathroom with his pants still around his ankles, exposing his genitalia to Sebbag, several flight attendants, and the nearby passengers on the plane,” the lawsuit said.\n\nIt added that Lieb said he felt “sexually violated and embarrassed after having been publicly exposed in the nude”.\n\n“With Sebbag leading Liebb, the pilot proceeded to repeatedly push the [two] back to their seats while making threats of getting [them] arrested and making scathing remarks about their Judaism, and how ‘Jews act’,” the lawsuit continued.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are homeland. You have no rights here.”\n\nThe men said United booked them on a flight to New York City the next day for free, but any savings from the complementary tickets were lost because they had to pay for an overnight hotel stay and food during their delay.\n\nThe two men said that the handcuffs caused “severe wrist pain” that “persisted for days afterwards”.\n\nMaya Yang contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Like the child who realises that her parents were joking when they said she was their favourite, people all around the world are coming to the life-changing realisation that their nation’s relationship with the United States was not really “special”.\n\nNot Australia, or Canada, or Britain, or France, or Germany, or Japan or the scores of others that for decades believed that they had a unique, protective and lucrative relationship with the “most powerful country ever in recorded history”.\n\nIt has come as a shock everywhere, poll after poll reveals that trust in the US has collapsed and leaders are frantically trying to recalibrate.\n\nBut to what?\n\nThere is no rulebook. Gillian Tett has described the changed approach emanating from the White House as a terrifying game of “revenge politics and the punitive measures and the beggar-thy-neighbor” approach to economics.\n\nTett is worth listening to. She is the Financial Times commentator who predicted the global financial crisis, and later wrote the bestselling Fool’s Gold about the 2008 collapse that revealed the fractures beneath an economic system based on finance not manufacturing.\n\nThat crisis revealed a naked emperor. But in country after country, most of the emperors sitting in their glass towers in financial districts continued as though nothing had happened, without punishment. The system was deemed too big to fail and their companies received generous bailouts.\n\nIt was ordinary folk who lost their homes and savings and were forced to endure wrong-headed austerity policies that simply made life harder and further weakened public trust.\n\nOver the following 17 years, a small number of billionaires grew ever richer and more influential. As America strives to become even greater, the threats of another global collapse looms.\n\nAustralia managed the 2008 crisis better than most nations, because of forward thinking, targeted intervention by a proactive government and the seemingly insatiable Chinese need for iron ore.\n\nIt will be a test to see which countries are the nimblest when it comes to the recalibration that is now needed.\n\nAs Tett, who is also the provost of King’s College Cambridge, observes: “Every single person assumes that the intellectual framework they grew up with and built their careers around is natural, normal, inevitable and should be universal. That’s just the nature of being human. And everybody is wrong. Ideas change over time. They go in fashions or cycles.”\n\nThe current generation of policymakers and business leaders have grown up with strong faith in the market, in a globalism based on assessments of national comparative advantage and regulation by internationally accepted rules.\n\nSo now they throw their hands up in horror and point to established economic theory and expostulate that tariffs don’t work, that government services are essential and point to legal and political theory that demonstrates why a rules-based system has on balance for 80 years served most of us well.\n\nCritics have been pointing to the flaws in the global neoliberal system for years, highlighting the increasing levels of inequality, the hollowing out of economies based on narrow definitions of comparative advantage and environmental destruction.\n\nBut efforts to devise a new model have been slow and unproductive, despite increasing public unease. Those who have done best out of this system will not easily give up. Donald Trump’s courtiers were involved in these bubbling discussions, but from a different perspective. They have developed thick skins from being outsiders whose ideas were marginalised and shouted down.\n\nThey now have access to power and have pushed the economic discussion into uncharted territory with a president ready to sign another executive order. They are not interested in making the system fairer. Their goal is to make America great, their strategy to reset the global financial and trading system, and their tactics bullying with tariffs, threats and military power.\n\nFor the past 150 years America has been a dominant power. Despite only having about 5% of the world’s population, it has consistently accounted for about a quarter of the world’s economic output. Over that time the guiding paradigm of economics and social organisation have changed, as old models imploded, or collapsed with war.\n\nAustralia has been adept at responding to changing economic paradigms. It developed a national ethos that moved beyond a colonial mindset at the beginning of the 20th century. Its economists were at the forefront of developing what became known as Keynesianism to use the resources of the state in conjunction with private industry to maximise public benefit, and when this model ossified Australia developed what was referred to as the third way, an approach to deregulation and privatisation that actively balanced interests but has weakened over time.\n\nThe question is whether there are the intellectual and capital resources to do so now. Australia is still one of the richest countries in the world but the economy is now one of the least diverse and complex. Our comparative advantage in resources remains but we have not been as attentive as we should to our comparative advantages in education, research, democratic institution building and fostering equality of opportunity and income.\n\nJust like those adult children who discover they were not the favourite find new ways of working together, nations will need to find new ways to collaborate without a manipulative parent in the room.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "View image in fullscreen Illustration: Angelica Alzona/The Guardian\n\nEntering the magnificent great hall of the US Department of Justice, Donald Trump stopped for a moment to admire his portrait, then took to a specially constructed stage where two art deco statues, depicting the Spirit of Justice and Majesty of Justice, had been carefully concealed behind a blue velvet curtain.\n\nThe president, who since last year is also a convicted criminal, proceeded to air grievances, utter a profanity and accuse the news media of doing “totally illegal” things, without offering evidence. “I just hope you can all watch for it,” he told justice department employees, “but it’s totally illegal.”\n\nTrump’s breach of the justice department’s traditional independence last week was neither shocking nor surprising. His speech quickly faded from the fast and furious news cycle. But future historians may regard it as a milestone on a road leading the world’s oldest continuous democracy to a once unthinkable destination.\n\nEviscerating the federal government and subjugating Congress; defying court orders and delegitimising judges; deporting immigrants and arresting protesters without due process; chilling free speech at universities and cultural institutions; cowing news outlets with divide-and-rule. Add a rightwing media ecosystem manufacturing consent and obeyance in advance, along with a weak and divided opposition offering feeble resistance. Join all the dots, critics say, and America is sleepwalking into authoritarianism.\n\n“These are flashing red lights here,” Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director turned Trump critic. “We are approaching Defcon 1 for our democracy and a lot of people in the media and the opposition leadership don’t seem to be communicating that to the American people. That is the biggest danger of the moment we’re in now: the normalisation of it.”\n\nMuch was said and written by journalists and Democrats during last year’s election campaign arguing that Trump, who instigated a coup against the US government on 6 January 2021, could endanger America’s 240-year experiment with democracy if he returned to power. In a TV interview, he had promised to be “dictator” but only on “day one”. Sixty days in, the only question is whether the warnings went far enough.\n\nThe 45th and 47th president has wasted no time in launching a concerted effort to consolidate executive power, undermine checks and balances and challenge established legal and institutional norms. And he is making no secret of his strongman ambitions.\n\nTrump, 78, has declared “We are the federal law” and posted a social media image of himself wearing a crown with the words “Long live the king”. He also channeled Napoleon with the words: “He who saves his country does not violate any law.” And JD Vance has stated that “judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power”.\n\nTrump quickly pardoned those who attacked the US Capitol on January 6, placed loyalists in key positions within the FBI and military and purged the justice department, which also suffered resignations in response to the dismissal of corruption charges against the New York mayor Eric Adams after his cooperation on hardline immigration measures.\n\nThe president now has the courts in his sights. Last weekend, the White House defied a judge’s verbal order blocking it from invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law meant only to be used in wartime, to justify the deportation of 250 Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador, where they will be held in a 40,000-person megaprison.\n\nTrump accused James Boasberg, the chief district judge in Washington who made the ruling, of being “crooked”, said he should be “impeached” and labelled him a “radical left lunatic of a judge”. The outburst prompted John Roberts, the chief justice of the supreme court, to deliver a rare rebuke of the president, emphasing that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision”.\n\nIn an interview on the conservative Fox News network, Trump denied defying a court order and said he would not do so in future. But he added ominously: “We have very bad judges and these are judges that shouldn’t be allowed. I think at a certain point, you have to start looking at what do you do when you have a rogue judge?”\n\nDavid Frum, a former speechwriter for George W Bush, posted on the X social media platform: “Almost every major Trump action is intentionally illegal. Trump is gambling that the US democratic system is too broken to stop him. He assumes, to borrow a phrase: ‘All we’ve got to do is kick the door in and the whole edifice will come crumbling down.’ Testing hour is here.”\n\nThe White House has yet to release the names of the deported Venezuelans or proof that they were indeed criminal gang members. In another recent incident, it sent 40 undocumented immigrants to the notorious detention facility at the Guantánamo Bay naval base, only for a judge to intervene and force their return to the mainland.\n\nSome commentators suggest that the Trump administration is exploiting the power of sadistic spectacle. They say it is priming the public for future crackdowns and testing its level of tolerance for a moment when, for example, it might invoke the Insurrection Act to target anti-Trump protesters.\n\nSteve Schmidt, a political strategist and former campaign operative for George W Bush and John McCain, said: “Donald Trump is producing a Washington television show from the Oval Office that’s authoritarian in nature. You go on TikTok and see the deportations scored to songs and videos released by the administration. It’s a theatre of the absurd. It’s a theatre of malice. All of it is desensitising people to the use of authority and power.”\n\nViolations of civil liberties are piling up on an almost daily basis. They include incidents that, if they had happened anywhere else in the world before 2025, the US would have been among the first to condemn.\n\nJasmine Mooney, a Canadian entrepreneur and actor in the American Pie movie franchise, was detained for almost two weeks in “inhumane” conditions by US border authorities over an incomplete visa. She wrote in the Guardian: “I was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.”\n\nFabian Schmidt, a German national who is a permanent US resident, was detained and, his mother said, “violently interrogated”, stripped naked and put in a cold shower by US border officials. A French scientist was denied entry to the US after immigration officers at an airport searched his phone and found messages in which he had expressed criticism of the Trump administration, according to the French government.\n\nRasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist who previously worked and lived in Rhode Island, was deported despite having a US visa. Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral scholar at Georgetown University and citizen of India married to a Palestinian, was detained by immigration agents who told him his visa had been revoked.\n\nColumbia University student activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal US resident with no criminal record, was detained over his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and is fighting deportation efforts in federal court. Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator, reacted on social media: “In dictatorships, they call this practice ‘being disappeared’. No charges, no claims of criminal behaviour. The White House doesn’t claim he did anything criminal. He’s in jail because of his political speech.”\n\nAnother trigger for alarm is Trump’s close relationship with tech oligarchs, many of whom donated to and attended his inauguration. Tesla and SpaceX head Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has been taking a chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy, firing thousands of workers in indiscriminate ways that have been challenged in court.\n\nMusk’s X regularly parrots pro-Trump propaganda. Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon and the Washington Post, recently ordered that the newspaper narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. Several star reporters and columnists have quit in recent months.\n\nTrump has escalated attacks on media outlets whose coverage he dislikes, including barring them from workspaces and events. He has filed lawsuits against media outlets and falsely claimed the flagship series 60 Minutes admitted guilt regarding a lawsuit.\n\nHis appointee to head the Federal Communications Commission is investigating PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) and NPR (National Public Radio). Last weekend, the Trump administration put almost the entire staff of Voice of America – which began broadcasting in 1942 to combat Nazi propaganda – on leave and ended grants to Radio Free Asia and other media with similar news programming.\n\nTrump’s moves in the foreign policy arena hold up a mirror to his domestic vision. He has rattled longtime allies in Europe over whether the US remains committed to Nato and has sided with Russia in talks to end the war in Ukraine. He even called the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a “dictator” and berated him in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump has long shown an affinity for autocrats such as Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong-un of North Korea and his actions have been compared with those of Viktor Orbán in consolidating power in Hungary, including remaking the judiciary, gaming elections and cracking down on media and civic organisations.\n\nAt the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington this week, JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, told the Guardian: “If you haven’t already read about Orbán in Hungary, go read about what he did steadily, not that slowly, to put the noose around that country. Donald Trump admires Orbán and I believe he and his team have learned from that and are replicating that.”\n\nWhat some find most frightening of all is the relative lack of resistance so far. Trump’s approval rating equals his best-ever mark as president at 47%, according to a recent NBC News poll, although a majority – 51% - disapproves of his performance. Some 55% of voters approve of his handling of border security and immigration, while 43% disapprove.\n\nSetmayer, who now heads the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, commented: “The fact that Donald Trump’s approval rating is still in the mid-40s should scare the hell out of every American who understands the value of our constitutional republic, the freedoms that we enjoy and the rule of law, because what he is doing is categorically against everything this country was founded on.”\n\nThis is reflected in Congress, where the Republican party is more loyal to and unquestioning of Trump than ever. Few members have dared to speak out against the president’s support for Putin, haphazard tariff policy or bullying of neighbour Canada. They know that dissent would likely result in public humiliation on social media and a primary election challenge funded by Musk.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, are still struggling to meet the moment as swelling protests across the country hunger for leadership. Last week, Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, reversed his position by voting to pass a Republican budget plan that will make cuts to housing, transportation and education while also empowering Trump and Musk to slash more programmes.\n\nFaced with the prospect of a government shutdown, Schumer argued that he was choosing the lesser of two evils but ignited a furious backlash from Democrats in the House of Representatives and grassroots activists. NBC’s poll found that just 27% of voters say they have positive views of the party, its lowest rating since the question was first asked in 1990.\n\nMeagan Hatcher-Mays, a senior adviser for United for Democracy, a coalition of 140 organisations aimed at reforming the courts, said Democrats were wrongfooted by Trump’s narrow victory in the national popular vote last year.\n\n“They took the wrong lesson from the outcome of that election and they think Donald Trump is a lot more popular than he actually is,” she said. “Their baseline is already to be scared but that made them more scared to push back or resist against some of Donald Trump’s worst impulses. What you have now is they’re more comfortable caving and that’s what they have been doing.\n\n“They have not been able to mount a durable opposition to Donald Trump or to congressional Republicans. You can’t just be not Donald Trump. You have to be for something and you have to paint a vision for what you want for the American people. Instead what they’ve decided to do is just say nothing and hope for the best and that is not going to win them any seats in 2026.”\n\nThe courts are potentially the last line of defence. Federal judges have blocked dozens of Trump’s initiatives, including attempts to eliminate agencies, end birthright citizenship and freeze federal funding. This week, a judge found that Doge likely violated the constitution “in multiple ways” with its dismantling of the development agency USAID.\n\nJamie Raskin, a Democratic representative from Maryland, noted that Democrats and their allies have filed more than 125 cases against various attacks on the rule of law and obtained more than 40 temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.\n\n“We’re in the fight of our lives,” he told the Guardian. “This is not a two-week, two-month or even two-year fight that we’re in. This is going to take us many years to defeat the forces of authoritarian reaction, and the Democrats are rising to the occasion.\n\n“If you look at the way democratic societies responded to fascism a century ago, it just takes time for people to realign and refocus and mobilise a concerted and unified response. Are we there yet? No. But are we going to be in a place where we can stand together and defeat authoritarianism in our country? Yes, we are going to get there.”\n\nNorm Eisen, a lawyer and founder of State Democracy Defenders Action, has brought successful cases that stopped Trump targeting thousands of FBI employees and blocked Musk’s access to sensitive data at the treasury department. He said: “Donald Trump is definitely pushing towards authoritarianism. He promised to be a dictator on day one and he hasn’t stopped. That’s the bad news.\n\n“The good news is that he has met vigorous pushback from litigants like myself and many others and from courts at every level. So far, his most outrageous illegal conduct has been countered.”\n\nIf the Trump administration ignores such orders, the US could face a full-blown constitutional crisis. But Eisen retains measured optimism, saying: “It’s a mistake to count us out. We have so surprised ourselves and the world over and over again in our history and there is cause for hope here when you see the furious legal pushback by lawyers.\n\n“There is reason for hope but nobody knows. Will we go the way of Brazil, Poland, Czech Republic, where I was ambassador, all of which pushed out autocratic regimes in recent years? Or will we go the way of Hungary and Turkey, which failed to oust autocrats? It remains to be seen but I, at least, am hopeful.”",

        "content": "A Cornell University PhD student earlier this month sued the Trump administration seeking to stop the president’s order aimed at foreign students accused of “antisemitism”. Days later, lawyers at the justice department emailed to request that the student “surrender” to immigration officials.\n\nMomodou Taal, a dual citizen of the UK and The Gambia, is one of three Cornell students who are plaintiffs in a lawsuit seeking to block the enforcement of Trump executive orders aimed at deporting foreign university students and staff involved in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\n“Only in a dictatorship can the leader jail and banish political opponents for criticizing his administration,” Taal, 31, wrote in a statement accompanying the lawsuit, which was submitted by lawyers at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), a civil rights group, on 15 March.\n\nTaal is pursuing a PhD at Cornell’s Africana Studies and Research Center, and was an outspoken activist on Cornell’s campus. He was suspended last year for his role in anti-Zionist protests at the university.\n\nOn Wednesday, he wrote on X that he believed that, days after filing the lawsuit, “law enforcement from an unidentified agency” came to his home seeking to detain him. His lawyers then submitted a motion to stop the government from “attempting to detain, remove, or otherwise enforce the two executive orders against Mr Taal”. The court had ordered the government to respond to the request by 5pm on Saturday.\n\nIn an email sent to Taal’s attorneys early Friday morning, a justice department lawyer wrote: “ICE invites Mr Taal and his counsel to appear in-person” at the homeland security investigations Office in Syracuse “at a mutually agreeable time” to be served a “notice to appear” – the first step in the formal process of deportation – and to surrender to immigration authorities.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment, and did not explain its reasoning in requesting surrender from Taal while he has a pending request for a restraining order.\n\n“Lawyers at the so-called Justice Department made this request to his attorneys within hours of us having asked the court to stop them from doing precisely that,” Lee told the Guardian. “It’s very difficult to explain how unprecedented this is.\n\n“This is something that should shock everybody. The most fundamental right in a democracy is the right to seek redress for grievances against the government,” Lee added. “God knows where they would send [Taal], simply because he decided to access the federal courts with American citizen colleagues to challenge whether what Trump is doing is legal or not.”\n\nIn the lawsuit against the administration, Taal’s lawyers write that “he lives in constant fear that he may be arrested by immigration officials or police as a result of his speech”; he has had to cancel international speaking engagements; and he is fearful of traveling to London to visit family.\n\nHis complaint comes just weeks after the high-profile arrest of Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian protest leader Mahmoud Khalil, and amid a series of escalating actions seeking to quell pro-Palestinian discourse at universities.\n\nThe other two plaintiffs in the case are both US citizens – Mukoma Wa Ngũgĩ, a professor in the English department, and Sriram Parasuram, a PhD student in the School of Integrative Plant Science. Their complaint asserts that the administration’s crackdown on protestors “has unconstitutionally silenced plaintiffs and chilled protected expression, prohibiting them from speaking, hearing, or engaging with viewpoints critical of the US government or the government of Israel”.\n\nTaal was suspended twice by Cornell last year for alleged disruptive protest and was told that his suspension could result in him losing his visa, but he was eventually allowed to resume attending classes remotely.\n\nHe has faced criticism for online comments after the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. He posted soon after the attack: “Wherever you have oppression, you will find those who fighting against it. Glory to the resistance!”\n\nIn an interview with CNN in 2023, he said it was racist and Islamophobic “that before I’m allowed to have a view on genocide, I have to condemn a terrorist organization … I can say clearly categorically I abhor the killing of all civilians no matter where they are and who does it.”\n\nOver the past week, judges have blocked the government from deporting Khalil and an Indian national at Georgetown University whose wife is of Palestinian heritage. Both academics, alongside Taal, were among the many pro-Palestinian voices targeted by a hardline pro-Israel social media account. The accounts have publicized the names and locations of numerous students and flagged US officials in posts, encouraging arrests and deportations.",

        "content": "The Trump administration is reported to have cut funding to a legal program that provides representation for unaccompanied immigrant children, one month after directing immigration enforcement agents to track down minors who had entered the US without guardians last month.\n\nOrganizations that collectively receive more than $200m in federal grants were informed that the contract through the office of refugee resettlement had been partially terminated, according to a memo issued on Friday by the interior department and obtained by ABC News.\n\nThe cut affects funding for legal representation and for the recruitment of attorneys to represent immigrant children but maintains a contract for “Know Your Rights”, a presentation given to unaccompanied immigrant children in detention centers.\n\nCurrently, 26,000 immigrant children receive government-funded legal representation, but many are representing themselves in immigration court due to a shortage of attorneys. In 2023, 56% of unaccompanied minors in immigration courts were represented by counsel, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nIn a White House memo to the justice department posted on Saturday, the executive branch identified the immigration system as one of several legal areas “where rampant fraud and meritless claims have supplanted the constitutional and lawful bases upon which the President exercises core powers”.\n\n“The immigration bar, and powerful Big Law pro bono practices, frequently coach clients to conceal their past or lie about their circumstances when asserting their asylum claims, all in an attempt to circumvent immigration policies enacted to protect our national security and deceive the immigration authorities and courts into granting them undeserved relief,” the White House said.\n\nThe memo directed the attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, “to prioritize enforcement of their respective regulations governing attorney conduct and discipline”.\n\nLawyers for Civil Rights, a legal advocacy group currently suing the administration over deportations, called Trump’s sanctions threat hypocritical in a statement to Reuters, saying the president and his allies “have repeatedly thumbed their noses at the rule of law”.\n\nThe move to cut funding for legal representation was immediately denounced by immigrant legal and welfare groups.\n\n“The US government is violating legal protections for immigrant children and forcing them to fight their immigration cases alone,” said Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu, deputy director of the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.\n\n“Already, we are seeing the government move for the expedited removal of unrepresented children. These services are critical not only as a matter of fundamental fairness – children should not be asked to stand up in court alone against a trained government attorney – but also for protecting children from trafficking, abuse and exploitation, and for helping immigration courts run more efficiently.”\n\nLindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), said the Trump administration had gone “all-in today on endangering unaccompanied children and interfering with their right to due process, breaking with decades of bipartisan congressional support for legal services for vulnerable children”.\n\nToczylowski added that without representation, “the 26,000 children whose access to counsel was slashed today will be at higher risk of exploitation and trafficking and their chances of obtaining legal protection will plummet. No child should be forced to fend for themselves against a trained [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] attorney without a lawyer by their side.”\n\nA study published by Save the Children in December found that record numbers of unaccompanied minors have come into the US since 2021.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "In September 2015, I was unemployed, heartbroken and living alone in my dead grandad’s caravan, wondering what the meaning of life was. Where was I going to find happiness, or purpose, or meaning? What was the point to all of this?\n\nLike any millennial, I turned to Google for the answers. I trawled through essays, newspaper articles, countless YouTube videos, various dictionary definitions and numerous references to the number 42, before I discovered an intriguing project carried out by the philosopher Will Durant during the 1930s. Durant had written to Ivy League presidents, Nobel prize winners, psychologists, novelists, professors, poets, scientists, artists and athletes to ask for their take on the meaning of life. His findings were collated in the book On the Meaning of Life, published in 1932.\n\nI decided that I should recreate Durant’s experiment and seek my own answers. I scoured websites searching for contact details, and spent hours carefully writing the letters, neatly sealing them inside envelopes and licking the stamps. Then I dropped them all into the postbox and waited ...\n\nDays, and then weeks, passed with no responses. I began to worry that I’d blown what little money I had on stamps and stationery. Surely, at least one person would respond?\n\nWhen someone finally did, it turned out to be a rejection. My heart continued to sink as I received a spate of letters returned to sender. Eventually, rather excitingly, replies started to drop through my letterbox.\n\nDuring the three months I spent living in the holiday park, walking the cliffs and trying to figure out my life, these responses greatly inspired me. Perhaps, as Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel alluded to in her answer, meaning had emerged through the practice of the quest.\n\nWhat follows is a small selection of the responses, from philosophers to politicians, prisoners to playwrights. Some were handwritten, some typed, some emailed. Some were scrawled on scrap paper, some on parchment. Some are pithy one-liners, some are lengthy memoirs. I sincerely hope you can take something from these letters, just as I did.\n\nMy letter\n\nIn 1931, the philosopher Will Durant wrote to 100 luminaries in the arts, politics, religion and sciences, challenging them to respond not only to the fundamental question of life’s meaning but also to relate how they each found meaning, purpose and fulfilment in their own lives. I am currently replicating Durant’s study, and I’d be most appreciative if you could tell me what you think the meaning of life is, and how you find meaning, purpose and fulfilment in your own life?\n\nAs Durant originally instructed, “Write briefly if you must; write at length and at leisure if you possibly can.”\n\n‘It’s like alchemy’: Hilary Mantel, late author\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Hilary Mantel/ Robinson/ Little Brown\n\nI’ve had your letter for a fortnight, but I had to think about it a bit. You use two terms interchangeably: “meaning” and “purpose”. I don’t think they’re the same. I’m not sure life has a meaning, in the abstract. But it can have a definite purpose if you decide so – and the carrying through, the effort to realise the purpose, makes the meaning for you.\n\nIt’s like alchemy. The alchemists were on a futile quest, we think. There wasn’t a philosopher’s stone, and they couldn’t make gold. But after many years of patience exercised, the alchemist saw he had developed tenacity, vision, patience, hope, precision – a range of subtle virtues. He had the spiritual gold, and he understood his life in the light of it. Meaning had emerged.\n\n‘It might be an idea to find meaning with something smaller, say a pickled walnut’: Michael Frayn, playwright and novelist\n\nThank you for inviting me to contribute to your anthology of views on the meaning of life. It’s not something I can respond to, I’m afraid, because it’s not clear to me how “life” can have a “meaning” in any ordinary sense of either word. It might be an idea to start with something smaller, say a pickled walnut. Once we’ve got it clear how a pickled walnut could have a “meaning”, we might move on to something larger – the borough of Haringey, say, or influenza – and work our way up.\n\n‘I’ve seen death many times. What matters most isn’t success, or wealth’: Kathryn Mannix, palliative care consultant\n\nEvery moment is precious – even the terrible moments. That’s what I’ve learned from spending 40 years caring for people with incurable illnesses, gleaning insights into what gives our lives meaning. Watching people living their dying has been an enormous privilege, especially as it’s shown me that it isn’t until we really grasp the truth of our own mortality that we awaken to the preciousness of being alive.\n\nEvery life is a journey from innocence to wisdom. Fairy stories and folk myths, philosophers and poets all tell us this. Our innocence is chipped away, often gently but sometimes brutally, by what happens to us. Gradually, innocence is transformed to experience, and we begin to understand who we are, how the world is, and what matters most to us.\n\nThe threat of having our very existence taken away by death brings a mighty focus to the idea of what matters most to us. I’ve seen it so many times, and even though it’s unique for everyone, there are some universal patterns. What matters most isn’t success, or wealth, or stuff. It’s connection and relationships and love. Reaching an understanding like this is the beginning of wisdom: a wisdom that recognises the pricelessness of this moment. Instead of yearning for the lost past, or leaning in to the unguaranteed future, we are most truly alive when we give our full attention to what is here, right now.\n\nWhatever is happening, experiencing it fully means both being present and being aware of being present. The only moment in our lives that we can ever have any choice about is this one. Even then, we cannot choose our circumstances, but we can choose how we respond: we can rejoice in the good things, relax into the delightful, be intrigued by the unexpected, and we can inhabit our own emotions, from joy to fear to sorrow, as part of our experience of being fully alive.\n\nI’ve observed that serenity is both precious and evanescent. It’s a state of flow that comes from relaxing into what is, without becoming distracted by what might follow. It’s a state of mind that rests in appreciation of what we have, rather than resisting it or disparaging it. The wisest people I have met have often been those who live the most simply, whose serenity radiates loving kindness to those around them, who have understood that all they have is this present moment.\n\nThat’s what I’ve learned so far, but it’s still a work in progress. Because it turns out that every moment of our lives is still a work in progress, right to our final breath.\n\n‘It means, above all, preserving the board on which we play this game’: Bill McKibben, author and environmentalist\n\nI’ve thought about this a good deal since you wrote.\n\nI think the meaning of life is to keep the remarkable game of being human going forward. In the past, this meant reproducing, above all. But, now, it means, above all, preserving the board on which we play this game. And since we’re now setting that board on fire, it’s our job to put that fire out. In our time, that’s the most important task we can undertake, since all depends on it. The best thing about the human game is that it, potentially, can stretch far out into the future – but only if we act now.\n\n‘Reading is my cubicle and my treehouse’: Gretchen Rubin, author and happiness expert\n\nIn my study of happiness and human nature, and in my own experiences, I have found that the meaning of life comes through love. In the end, it is love – all kinds of love – that makes meaning.\n\nIn my own life, I find meaning, purpose and fulfilment by connecting to other people – my family, my friends, my community, the world. In some cases, I make these connections face-to-face, and in others, I do it through reading. Reading is my cubicle and my treehouse; reading allows me better to understand both myself and other people.\n\n‘The secret of life is a very simple thing’: Matt Ridley, science writer\n\nThere never has been and never will be a scientific discovery as surprising, unexpected and significant as that which happened on 28 February 1953 in Cambridge, when James Watson and Francis Crick found the double-helix structure of DNA and realised that the secret of life is actually a very simple thing: it’s infinite possibilities of information spelled out in a four-letter alphabet in a form that copies itself.\n\n‘The first awareness, in Bergen-Belsen, was that kindness and goodwill had survived’: Susan Pollack, Holocaust survivor\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Susan Pollack/ Robinson/ Little Brown\n\nIn response to your letter, here are a few thoughts that assisted me to look forward in my youth after those bleak, horrendous times in 1944. I am a camp survivor from Auschwitz and was liberated from Bergen-Belsen on 15 April 1945. I was totally dehumanised, fearful, distrustful, lost to contemplate the future, all alone, unable to comprehend the values for a life in a modern civilisation.\n\nFourteen years old – unable to walk, to express the latent, suppressed anguish – the realisation I only speak Hungarian, no skills, no education, no finance, no support system, no knowledge.\n\nThe first awareness, in Bergen-Belsen, was the discovery that kindness and goodwill had also survived. When the British soldier lifted me up from the mud hole – seeing a twitch in my body – he gently placed me in one of the small ambulances. From that experience, miraculous goodwill is one of the guiding lights to this day. I often think of that moment and ask, “What part of that goodness with your heart do you take from that soldier?”\n\nKindness, generosity comes in small everyday events. Small measures of goodness have an enormous impact – to this day I take nothing for granted. I remember the effect and appreciation this first helpfulness had on my life – it gradually removed the heavy iron cover on me, and sparks of “I can do” and “I want to do” gradually came into my existence.\n\nIn Sweden, where I was taken for recuperation for my devastated physical corpse-like being, one of the facilitators had a large collection of classical records. These he played every evening, and we sat around and listened in awe to Beethoven symphonies and other pieces. In my interpretation, I could feel the energy of the music, from sorrow and despair to the drive of supreme human effort to rise above those destructive memories. I must say not completely – personally, I don’t want to let it go completely – but I am free of the chains which deprived me in the camps. Music, generally, has an enormous effect on my life.\n\nI moved on. I became a Samaritan helper for some eight years. I took a degree at the age of 60 and then a diploma in psychology. For me, life is full of possibilities, like a search engine – find your meaning for existence that makes me feel worthy – self-esteem is the reward.\n\nI was fortunate in having a family and could play with my grandchildren, reclaiming those years of persecution.\n\nI remember the doctor in Sweden who took me in his arms to teach me walking, and turned to me saying: “I have a little girl like you.” What a discovery about myself – powerful words that still ring in my ears long after 70 years – I cherish kind words. These are the propelling force to continue our journey and many more small events that had a huge impact on my life.\n\n‘I could not be happy if the only things that motivated me were purely mercenary’: John Major, former prime minister\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: The Rt Hon Sir John Major/ Robinson/ Little Brown\n\nIt is not easy to respond to this, except perhaps in the negative: life would have no meaning without family and friends, nor without an incentive for getting out of bed each morning. I could not be happy if I were idle, nor if the only things that motivated me were purely mercenary, with no personal interest or connection. We all need a purpose – large or small – and that, to me, is what gives life its meaning.\n\n‘I want to show up fully, or as fully as possible, for my time on Earth’: Oliver Burkeman, author and journalist\n\nI agree with the scholar of mythology Joseph Campbell, that it makes more sense to say that what we’re seeking isn’t a meaning for life, so much as the experience of feeling fully alive. There are experiences that I know, in my bones, are “why I’m here” – unhurried time with my son, or deep conversations with my wife, hikes in the North York Moors, writing and communicating with people who’ve found liberation in something I have written. I would struggle, though, if I were to try to argue that any of these will “mean something” in some kind of timeless way, for example, 500 years from now.\n\nWhat’s changed for me is that I no longer feel these experiences need this particular kind of justification. I want to show up fully, or as fully as possible, for my time on Earth. That’s all – but, then again, I think that is everything. And so I try, on a daily basis, to navigate more and more by that feeling of aliveness – rather than by the feeling of wanting to be in control of things, which is alluring, but deadening in the end.\n\n‘The meaningless cruelty of my niece’s death taught me about life’s purpose’: Monica Heisey, author, essayist and screenwriter\n\nYours is a big question, certainly, and one I have been thinking about a lot this year. Last spring, my niece Rosemary was born, squirming and healthy and pink, with my sister’s big blue eyes and my brother-in-law’s button nose. Nine days later, she died in her sleep. On the phone with my sobbing mother, I realised my sense of life’s meaning had been undefined, or at least had never been tested. I’d been chugging along, untouched by capital-T tragedy, oblivion feeling blissfully abstract.\n\nConfronted for the first time with the Real Deal, I searched for meaning, and found none. There had been no warning, would turn out to be no cause, and of course it had not happened “for a reason”. Something terrible had occurred from nowhere, and now our lives were changed for ever, and Rosie would not get to have one. I felt nihilism like a riptide, swirling around me and tugging at my ankles. It would have been easy to go under.\n\nBut the days and weeks after the meaningless cruelty of Rosie’s death also taught me about life’s purpose, or at least showed me a way I might define it. I had anticipated a week of quiet mourning punctuated by a kind of depressed chaos as everyone scrambled to arrange a funeral and perform grim and foreign administrative tasks. I assumed tragedy on this scale would feel lonely. But my memories from that period are densely populated: old friends rallying, travelling long distances to hold my sister and her husband and look at pictures and remember a person they would never get to know; my long-divorced parents coming together to provide a soft place to land for their three long-grown children; distant relatives with stories we’d never heard about cousins we’d also never be able to meet; a cluster of colleagues surrounding my sister, huddling like a football team about to break for a challenging second half; the unlikely presence of my divorce lawyer with a box of homemade scones and clotted cream.\n\nInstead of numb or adrift, I felt almost painfully alive. We were surrounded, I realised, by Rosie’s community, who were, of course, ours too. There were faces I hadn’t seen in years – due to life and geography and the pandemic – and I saw then that they had not been gone, not really. We hadn’t “lost touch”, we had just been busy, all of us, with work and children and the business of living, but now they were needed, and so here they were. Increasingly, I think this is the only purpose we have: to be in connection with each other, to batten down our collective hatches against life’s many and various brutalities. To me, everything else that feels like purpose – making and consuming art, engaging in collective efforts to better society or the planet, listening deeply to loved ones – is really an avenue to connection, providing it and being enriched by it, too.\n\nIn terms of happiness, many people more intelligent than I have suggested shooting for contentment instead, and I think they are right. Still, there are some things that make me reliably happy, and I have found much contentment in cultivating opportunities to experience them. These include: friends’ laughter, reading at the bar, unrealistically flattering denim, good gossip, morning sex, coffee and a walk with a slight hangover, a sunny day experienced from a safely shaded area, cornbread, cats, the exhilaration of being bad at something new, boxing (relatedly), and making a sauce for three to five hours. There are more, of course – the list grows all the time – and keeping track of them feels important.\n\nI suppose happiness is knowing what is personally meaningful to you, and engaging with it, which is kind of a nice full circle to come to in this letter. A natural conclusion that returns to the beginning makes me happy, too. Another for the list.\n\n‘Four and a half decades of my life have been in a hole, but I’ve still enjoyed it’: Charles Salvador, aka Charles Bronson, one of Britain’s longest-serving prisoners\n\nView image in fullscreen Letter from Charles Bronson, for Saturday magazine - Meaning of Life, Mar 22 Photograph: Charles Bronson/ Robinson/ Little Brown\n\nLife is, to me, a gift.\n\nYou have to respect it.\n\nAppreciate it.\n\nHold on to it for as long as possible.\n\nPeople who let go don’t deserve it.\n\nFour and a half decades of my life have been in a hole, But I’ve still enjoyed it.\n\nI made it work for me.\n\nCoz I found “myself”.\n\n[Overleaf] Never piss on a rattlesnake!\n\n‘Failure is fine. It’s how you respond to it that makes all the difference’: Fatima Whitbread, retired British javelin thrower\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Fatima Whitbread/ Robinson/ Little Brown\n\nIf you add value to other people’s lives, you’ll never be at a loss for living a life of purpose. The purpose is what ultimately leads to happiness. Society emphasises success a great deal, and some people overreact to it by being overly harsh on themselves, on their perceptions of what success is. Rather, ask yourself, how can I add value today? And then do it.\n\nMy learning is that you’re going to fail. If you do anything at all in life that is noteworthy. On the other hand, if you play it safe you might not fail. But then you probably didn’t reach your fullest potential, either. Failure is fine. It’s how you respond to it that makes all the difference in the world.\n\nDon’t blame anyone for the failure, least of all yourself. Simply acknowledge what has happened, note what you’ve learned and how you’d do it differently next time, and move on. Make no excuses. They are simply a waste of everybody’s time. Worst comes to worst, you’ve learned something new that makes you a more multi-dimensional person, an interesting person. After all, it’s not failing that matters, but learning from our failures.\n\nAnd if you don’t try, how can you possibly fail in the first place?\n\n‘I asked my mother what she thought it was, from her now frail vantage point’: Anil Seth, professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience\n\nIt feels strange to be writing to you about the meaning of life while my mother is struggling to hold on to hers. At the age of 89 she’s had a long life by the standards of human history, but any human life is the briefest glimmer in the vastness of time. The inconceivable brevity of human existence brings questions about meaning, purpose and fulfilment into sharp relief.\n\nMy mother was born in York in 1934, on Christmas Day, and grew up playing in the ruins of bombed-out buildings. She was a teacher, and later an artist and a landscape photographer. Lately, before her recent illness, she would wonder to me at the prospect of nonexistence. She knows she will die, as most of us do at some level, but she cannot imagine not existing. As the horizons of her life have contracted, she has been able to find contentment in simpler and simpler things: the rhythms of the garden, the play of light on the leaves of a tree. This flexibility suggests to me that meaning, purpose and fulfilment are not only different things, but moving targets, if they are targets at all.\n\nI’ve spent my career trying to understand more about the mystery of consciousness. About how the mess of neural wetware inside our heads can give rise to the everyday miracle of experience. Consciousness is intimately familiar to each of us. We all know what it’s like to be conscious, and what it’s like to lose consciousness when we fall into a dreamless sleep. The nature of consciousness is also endlessly perplexing, confounding scientists and thinkers for thousands of years.\n\nSome people worry that pursuing a scientific perspective on conscious experience might drain life of meaning by reducing us to mere biological machinery. I have found the opposite to be the case. There is no reduction. There is rather a continuity with the natural world, and with this continuity comes an expansion, a wider and deeper perspective. As we gradually pull back the curtains on the biological basis of conscious experience in all its richness, there are new opportunities to take ourselves and our conscious lives less for granted. We can see ourselves more as part of, and less apart from, the rest of nature. Our brief moments in the light of existence become more remarkable for having happened at all.\n\nA recognition of the precarity of consciousness can help defuse some of our existential fears. We do not usually worry much about the oblivion that preceded our birth, so why should we worry about the equivalent oblivion that will follow our death? Oblivion isn’t the experience of absence, it is the absence of experience. As the novelist Julian Barnes put it, in his meditation on mortality, there is “nothing to be frightened of”.\n\nI’ve come to think of consciousness as the precondition for meaning. An argument can be made that without consciousness, nothing would matter at all. Meaning, purpose and fulfilment can take many forms against this backdrop. The Aristotelian concept of eudaimonia best captures what I have in mind here. Eudaimonia means living well, flourishing, doing that which is worth doing. It is not about pleasure or hedonic satisfaction, nor is it about selfless sacrifice for some greater good. It involves realising one’s potential through cultivating virtues such as reason, courage and wisdom. Fundamentally, it comes down to doing a bit of good and feeling good about doing so.\n\nFor me, participating in some small way in the scientific and philosophical journey to understand ourselves and our place in nature, and communicating some of this journey to others, offers the promise of a slice of eudaimonia. In practice, frustration lurks at every turn. There is the risk of hubris when dealing with such apparently grand matters. And the dramas of everyday life get in the way.\n\nWhich brings me back to my mother. Today she has rallied, unexpectedly confounding the prognosis of the doctors. I asked her what she thought the meaning of life was, from her now frail vantage point. She told me it was about relationships with other people, and who can argue with that.\n\n‘My brief answer: what the hell?’: Alan Ayckbourn, playwright and director\n\nView image in fullscreen Photograph: Alan Ayckbourn/ Robinson/ Little Brown\n\nSixty years ago, with a burgeoning career, on the verge of being a professional playwright and director, I would probably have readily answered your question. I felt, as they say, that the world was at my feet. These days, alas, I sense very much it is on my back. I have no idea why I write, nor indeed why I’m still alive. Probably the writing is as much a reflex for me as breathing. That’s all I can say.\n\nSorry, but you caught me at the wrong end of my existence. My brief answer: what the hell?\n\n‘I do not need to know it’: Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit\n\nWhat is the meaning of life? I can honestly say: I have no idea. But I write this in London, where I am visiting with my wife and two boys. And they are healthy and safe, and (mostly) happy, and there’s joy in watching their delights: a clothing stall with a jacket they’ve long wanted; the way the double-decker bus carries us above the fray; a monument to scientific discoveries beside a flower garden and goats.\n\nI’m surrounded by evidence – of the blitz, D-day, colonies despoiled, JFK and MLK and 9/11 – that all could be otherwise. I hear about bombs falling on innocents, an uncertain election, a faltering climate, and many of us lacking the will (or charity) to change.\n\nYet still I marvel that we flew here in under 12 hours – while my ancestors required months and tragedies to transit in reverse – and that I will send this note simply by hitting a button, and we can love whomever we want, and see and speak to them at any hour, and a pandemic did not end my life, did not kill my children’s dreams, did not make society selfish and cruel.\n\nAnd, for now, that’s enough. I do not need to know the meaning of life. I do not need to know the purpose of it all. Simply breathing while healthy and safe, and (mostly) happy is such a surprising, awe-inducing, humbling gift that I have no right to question it. I won’t tempt fate. I won’t look that gift horse in the mouth. I’ll simply hope my good fortune continues, work hard to share it with others, and pray I will remember this day, this moment, if my luck fades .",

        "content": "Boxing Hall of Famer and entrepreneur George Foreman has died at age 76, his family announced in an Instagram post on his account.\n\n“With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones,” the post read.\n\nForeman, a heavyweight champion boxer, was “a devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather”, the family’s statement said.\n\n“A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world. He was deeply respected – a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name – for his family.\n\n“We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.”\n\nAn intimidating, thunderous puncher who lost his first title to Muhammad Ali in their famous Rumble in the Jungle in 1974, “Big George” was a more rotund, jovial figure when he knocked out Michael Moorer for his second crown two decades later.\n\nForeman’s comeback and the fortune he made selling fat-wicking electric cooking grills made him an icon of self-improvement and success.\n\nView image in fullscreen George Foreman delivers a blow to Joe Frazier on the way to winning his first heavyweight title in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973. Photograph: AP\n\nSoon after his birth in Marshall, Texas, on 10 January 1949, his family moved to Houston, where he and his six siblings were raised by a single mother. Growing up poor in the segregated American south, Foreman dropped out of junior high school and used his size and fists in street robberies.\n\nThe job corps, part of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society reforms, “rescued me from the gutter”, Foreman later wrote. Through the program, 16-year-old Foreman moved out of Texas and was encouraged to channel his rage and growing bulk into boxing.\n\nAt age 19 and in his 25th amateur fight, Foreman captured the heavyweight boxing gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. After turning pro, he won 37 straight matches on his way to face reigning champion Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, winning by technical knockout in round two.\n\nForeman defended the belt twice more before meeting Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in one of the most celebrated boxing matches in history.\n\nView image in fullscreen George Foreman takes a punch from Muhammad Ali during their famous Rumble in the Jungle heavyweight title bout in 1974 in Kinshasa. Photograph: Mike Feldman/UPI/Shutterstock\n\nAli had been stripped of his crown seven years prior for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam war and came into the match a heavy underdog against the bigger, younger champion. But for seven rounds, Ali lay against the ropes and fended off Foreman’s clubbing blows, tiring and knocking him out in the eighth round.\n\n“I was one strong heavyweight punching fighter,” Foreman told Reuters in 2007. “I was one punching machine, and that was the first time I delivered everything I had and nothing worked.”\n\nThe loss devastated Foreman. He took a year off before returning to the ring and then, after a second professional loss, retired in 1977 to become an ordained minister in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nA decade later and considerably heavier at 143kg (315lb), Foreman staged an unlikely return to the ring to raise money for a youth centre he had founded in Texas.\n\nView image in fullscreen George Foreman weighs in before a fight in 1997, after making an unlikely comeback to boxing. Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nHe went on to win 24 straight matches, gradually slimming along the way, before losing to Evander Holyfield in a 12-round decision in 1991. Three years later, he knocked out undefeated southpaw Moorer to become the oldest-ever heavyweight champion at age 45.\n\nForeman’s last fight was in 1997, ending his career with a professional record of 76 wins and five losses.\n\nForeman was married four times in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1985, he married for the fifth time to Mary Joan Martelly, with whom he remained for the rest of his life. He had five sons – all called George – five biological daughters and two adopted daughters.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and after retirement, he was an enthusiastic pitchman for various products, most notably an electric grill from home appliance maker Salton Inc. In 1999, the company paid Foreman and his partners $137.5m to put his name on the grill and other goods.\n\n“What I do is fall in love with every product I sell,” Foreman wrote in his autobiography, By George. “That’s what sells. Just like with preaching.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump expanded his retribution campaign against law firms on Friday night as he ordered his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to refer what she determines to be partisan lawsuits to the White House and recommend punitive actions that could harm the firms involved.\n\nThe directives were outlined in a sweeping memo in which Trump alleged that too many law firms were filing frivolous claims designed to cause delays. It came after a week of setbacks, in which a slew of judges issued temporary injunctions blocking the implementation of Trump’s agenda.\n\nTrump’s memo directed Bondi to seek sanctions against the firms or disciplinary actions against the lawyers. But imposing sanctions is up to federal judges, and perhaps in recognition of the uncertainty that his attorney general would prevail, Trump also ordered referrals to the White House.\n\n“When the attorney general determines that conduct by an attorney or law firm in litigation against the federal government warrants seeking sanctions or other disciplinary action, the attorney general shall … recommend to the president … additional steps that may be taken,” the memo said.\n\nThe memo, as a result, created a formal mechanism for Trump to unilaterally decide whether to impose politically charged sanctions through executive orders that strip lawyers of the security clearances they need to perform their jobs or prevent them from working on federal contracts.\n\nMultiple legal experts suggested the memo would theoretically allow Bondi to decide a particular lawsuit that triggered a temporary injunction was causing an unnecessary delay, and refer the firm that filed the suit to face the effects of a punitive executive order.\n\nThat could cause a chilling effect and lead to the volume of litigation against the Trump administration to decline, the experts said. Even if the lawsuits are in fact for a legitimate purpose, there’s fear that their representation could put them in the president’s cross hairs and endanger their legal practices.\n\nTrump also directed Bondi to open a review into the “conduct” of lawyers and their respective law firms in litigation against the federal government reaching back to the start of his first term in 2017 – and recommend whether it warranted additional punitive actions.\n\nThe memo comes as Trump in recent weeks has used executive orders targeting law firms to great effect.\n\nMost recently, Trump stripped lawyers at the firm Paul Weiss of their security clearance and barred its employees from entering federal government buildings over his long-held complaint about a former partner, Mark Pomerantz, who tried to build a criminal case against him in New York.\n\nThe executive order targeting Paul Weiss was nearly identical to an order that punished the firm Perkins Coie over its ties to a lawyer who once worked with Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, and another aimed at Covington and Burling, which represented the former special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nPaul Weiss had its order withdrawn on Thursday after its chair, Brad Karp, offered a series of concessions including offering up criticism of Pomerantz apparently to appease Trump. He committed to providing $40m worth of legal services to causes that Trump has championed.\n\nBut Trump has stewed for days, according to people familiar with the matter, over a series of temporary restraining orders that have slowed the implementation of his political agenda and, in one instance, branded Elon Musk’s cost-cutting drive as likely unconstitutional.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s your first argument? The idea that because my written order was pithier so it could be disregarded, that’s one heck of a stretch,” Boasberg said at a recent hearing.\n\nThe administration has insisted it did not violate the order, but at the heart of the dispute is the administration’s belief that the judge lacked jurisdiction to hear the case in the first instance, ignoring the reality that federal courts can review whether statutes are properly invoked.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, as Trump has continued to rail against the injunction itself, the administration has adopted an increasingly combative stance towards Boasberg and said it was considering whether to invoke the rarely used state secrets privilege to stonewall the judge’s inquiry.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump’s imperial presidency is a tawdry, threadbare affair. The emperor has no clothes to cloak his counterfeit rule. Lacking crown and robes, he resorts to vulgar ties and baseball caps. His throne is but a bully pulpit, his palace a pokey, whitewashed house, his courtiers mere common hacks. His royal edicts – executive orders – are judicially contested. And while he rages like Lear, his critics are publicly crucified or thrown to the lions at Fox News.\n\nYet for all his crudely plebeian ordinariness, a parvenu imperialism is Trump’s global offer, his trademark deal and most heinous crime. He peddles it against the tide of history and all human experience, as if invasion, genocide, racial inequality, economic exploitation and cultural conquest had never been tried before. If it wasn’t clear already, it is now. He wants to rule the world.\n\nTrump’s menacing claims to Canada, Panama and Greenland revive the elitist fantasies of Elon Musk’s grandfather and Technocracy Inc, a 1930s rightwing populist movement that sought to unite North and Central America under US suzerainty – the “Technate”. The mindset feeding such pretensions is rooted deep in the national psyche. It’s a mix of Monroe doctrine, “manifest destiny” and the white man’s burden. It’s evil, it’s pernicious, and it’s back.\n\nIn 1823, president James Monroe, fending off predatory European powers, defined what Russia’s Vladimir Putin, among others, would today term an American “sphere of influence”. His doctrine was later used to justify US intervention in Latin America. Manifest destiny was the belief, popularised after 1845, that the young republic was divinely charged with spreading its dominion and “civilising influence” across the continent and into the Pacific region.\n\nWould Trump attempt ethnic cleansing of the lighter-skinned citizens of war-torn Ukraine? Everyone knows the answer to that\n\nNative Americans, exterminated and dispossessed, were principal victims. Manifest destiny helped spread slavery as new states joined the Union. Subsequent colonisations of the Philippines, Cuba and Hawaii were a natural extension. In 1899, Rudyard Kipling’s infamously racist poem, The White Man’s Burden, urged Americans to emulate the British empire and assume global responsibility for governing “new-caught sullen peoples”.\n\nThat latter phrase aptly describes Trump’s view today of 2 million Palestinians ensnared in Gaza, whom he wants to deport to Somaliland or some other promised land. Migrants corralled at the Mexico border face the white man’s burdensome prejudices, too. Would Trump attempt ethnic cleansing of the lighter-skinned, mostly Christian, citizens of war-torn Ukraine? Everyone knows the answer to that one. While lacking the older varieties’ surface pomp and majesty, Trump’s born-again imperialism bears the ugly hallmarks of earlier iterations. As before, it comes down to power and money, military might and economic pressure (such as tariffs), control of land, racial and cultural supremacy and an utterly hypocritical morality. It’s causing uproar at home. It infects every aspect of foreign policy.\n\nTrump may not be actively conniving in the killing and expulsion of Ukraine’s Indigenous population, but he’s doing his best to rob them of their birthright. In a travesty of negotiation, he cedes territory to Putin, bullies Kyiv’s leaders into seething submission, then makes a grab for Ukraine’s mineral wealth. Now he wants its nuclear power plants, too. This is not about making peace. It’s about making money. In Gaza, Trump picks over the bones before the victim has even died. Basic legalities, let alone humanity, are jettisoned. No matter that Israel’s genocidaires have killed about 50,000 Palestinians. He wants the seafront property free of charge, its surviving owners evicted, so he can build a luxury resort. “Welcome to the Rafah Riviera, the Trump Organisation’s Nakba-on-the-Med. Enjoy your stay!”\n\nTrump and his advisers envisage three neo-imperial superpower blocs, the US, Russia and China, united in disregard for the UN charter, international law and human rights and acting as they please in self-allotted spheres of influence. In this upended age, Russia is a lucrative business partner while European and Asian allies must fend for themselves. As ever, developing countries are exploited for their resources. To mangle George Canning, the Old World falls prey to the New.\n\nImperialism has evolved since the time of gunboats and missionaries. Absent now is a sense of higher calling and noble purpose\n\nIn the wider Middle East, Trump is infinitely more interested in forging a US-Saudi-Israel security, energy and investment alliance than in ending the Palestinian tragedy. A significant obstacle is Iran, another historical victim of colonialists. In his latest Putin schmooze, Trump asked for Russia’s help in containing its ally. Mullahs beware: there’s a whiff of betrayal in the air. Like big-power bullies throughout history, Trump picks on easy targets.

Like Putin, president Xi Jinping is playing it cool with Trump so far. These tuppenny tsars share much in common: authoritarianism, national aggrandisement, ruthless greed. So why fight? All three can be winners, and to winners go the spoils. Look out, Taiwan, meat in an unsavoury US-China sandwich.\n\nImperialism has evolved since the time of gunboats, missionaries and unequal treaties. Absent now is a sense of higher calling and noble purpose. Pioneering frontiersmen pursuing America’s manifest destiny genuinely believed theirs was a righteous cause. British colonial administrators thought they did God’s (and Queen Victoria’s) work. Today’s conquerors betray few such illusions. Even so, Trump casts himself as compassionate, noble-minded peacemaker. So will he pursue peace in desperate Sudan, Myanmar or Congo? Will he stop those “horrible wars” too? No, he will not. Such places do not feature on his redrawn maps. There’s no money or kudos in it for him. And this particular white man’s burden sharing does not extend to losers.\n\nIn a new, disorderly imperial age, megalomania waives the rules.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "I came across homemade celery salt by accident. As part of my ongoing mission to use up every part of any vegetable, I dehydrated some celeriac leaves to use as a garnish for a savoury cheese and mushroom porridge (see next week’s column), and was astounded by their rich, umami flavour. It was then that I realised they could be ground with sea salt to make that old kitchen staple, celery salt. Celery salt can be used to replace regular table salt and as a flavour enhancer for just about any savoury dish, from soup to salad; it’s also delicious as a seasoning for meat or fish and, of course, makes a sublimely savoury bloody mary.\n\nHomemade celery salt\n\nCelery leaves are a common byproduct from a bunch of celery, and other uses for them are simply to add some flavour to all manner of stocks, soups, stews and salads. They can also be preserved by dehydrating them to make the umami-rich seasoning that is celery salt.\n\nCelery is a natural source of sodium nitrate, which, like salt, is a natural preservative. Traditionally, celery salt was used as a preservative for meat and/or pickles, not least because it adds flavour – that’s why a steak seasoned with celery salt, for example, is notably delicious.\n\nLeaves from 1 bunch celery\n\nSea salt\n\nPick all the leaves off a bunch of celery – the light-coloured ones at the core as well as the darker, outer leaves. Next, dry the leaves in the oven. To save on energy, I often roast them alongside something else that I’m already cooking, or I’ll use the residual heat after I’ve used the oven. The leaves will take about eight minutes to dry in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven, though they may take a little longer if you go down the residual heat route (depending on the original oven temperature, of course). Once the leaves are completely dry and crisp, but not browned, take them out and leave to cool.\n\nEither grind the cooled dried leaves to a rough powder with your hands or finely chop with a knife, then stir into a jar of sea salt, but add only just enough salt to make sure it still has lots of celery flavour. Aim for aboutone part dried celery leaf powder to three parts sea salt, or a tablespoon for every three tablespoons of salt. Your celery salt will now keep indefinitely in a sealed jar.",

        "content": "Donald Trump moved to revoke security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and a string of other top Democrats and political enemies in a presidential memo issued late on Friday.\n\nThe security-clearance revocations also cover the former secretary of state Antony Blinken, the former Wyoming representative Liz Cheney, the former Illinois representative Adam Kinzinger and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who prosecuted Trump for fraud, as well as Biden’s entire family. They all will no longer have access to classified information – a courtesy typically offered to former presidents and some officials after they have left public service.\n\n“I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,” Trump wrote. He said he would also “direct all executive department and agency heads to revoke unescorted access to secure United States government facilities from these individuals”.\n\nEarlier this month, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she had revoked the clearances and blocked several of the people named in Trump’s memo, along with “the 51 signers of the Hunter Biden disinformation letter” – referring to former intelligence agency officials who asserted that the notorious Hunter Biden laptop, which was discovered before the 2020 election, was likely a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nTrump’s decision to remove Biden from intelligence briefings is a counterstrike against his Democrat political opponent, who had banned Trump from accessing classified documents in 2021, saying the then ex-president could not be trusted because of his “erratic behavior”.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump announced he was pulling Secret Service protections for Biden’s children, Hunter and Ashley, “effective immediately”, after it was claimed that 18 agents had been assigned to the former president’s son for a trip to South Africa and 13 to daughter Ashley.\n\nMore broadly, the security-clearance revocations issued on Friday appear to correlate with a cherrypicked list of the president’s political enemies, including the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, both of whom prosecuted Trump during the Biden era.\n\nOthers on the list include Fiona Hill, a foreign policy expert who testified against Trump during his first impeachment about her boss’s alleged scheme to withhold military aid to Ukraine as a way of pressuring its president to investigate the Bidens; Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel who also testified at the hearings; and Norman Eisen, a lawyer who oversaw that impeachment.\n\nLiz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Republicans who served on the committee investigating the January 6 US Capitol riots, were also added to the list. Trump said the information ban “includes, but is not limited to, receipt of classified briefings, such as the President’s daily brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the intelligence community”.\n\nThe move comes as NBC News reported that former president Biden and and his wife, Jill Biden, had volunteered to help fundraise for and help to rebuild the Democratic party after the stinging defeat of Biden’s nominated successor, Kamala Harris, in November.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "content": "In early 2020 life was sweet for Graham Hornigold. A pastry chef who has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants and been a judge on Junior Bake Off, he had recently launched his own small chain of high-end doughnut shops and cafes in London, along with his partner, New Zealander Heather Kaniuk, also a pastry chef. They had a baby on the way, too – a chance for Hornigold to create the happy family unit he hadn’t experienced in his own childhood.\n\nThen, out of the blue, dropped the email that would change his life. Hi Graham, I’m not sure if this is going to reach you as I’ve been searching for a way to contact you and found this email. My name’s Dionne, formerly known as Theresa … Graham was born in Germany before being taken away from me to England.\n\n“My first thought was: someone is taking the piss,” Hornigold tells me, over coffee at a branch of Longboys, his doughnut chain. But not a lot of people knew where he was born. Could this really be his long-lost mum?\n\nHornigold came into the world at a British army base in Germany in 1974. From the age of two he was fostered for a couple of years – he doesn’t know why – then he lived in Hertfordshire with his dad, a sapper in the Royal Engineers, and his stepmother. Hornigold’s birth mother wasn’t around; he didn’t know where she was, or even who. His dad – who drank and could be violent – didn’t say much about her, except that she had left.\n\nHornigold describes his upbringing as difficult, and his father as “ex-army, classic 1970s”. He has a scar on his head from where his dad kicked him when he was seven. The last time they met Hornigold was 18, and knocking his father down. He does know he’s no longer around.\n\nThere are a couple of ways Hornigold could have dealt with his difficult childhood. “Either you allow life to consume you and become bitter, or you utilise those challenges,” he says. He chose option B, went to college to study catering and followed his dream of becoming a chef. “The challenges are a trauma response – you advance yourself or feel a sense of acceptance.”\n\nHe has a habit of slipping into the second person: putting up a grammatical buffer between himself and difficult memories, perhaps. But that’s what Hornigold did: threw himself into his passion for pastry. He says to love someone is to feed them: “Your first meal comes from your mother. If that’s not the greatest act of love, tell me what is.” Having missed out, he did wonder about his mother. Her name was on his birth certificate, but internet searches hadn’t thrown up anything. It was she who had decided to come back into his life.\n\nI wonder, given what happened, if he now wishes she hadn’t? “I wish she’d just come in and said, ‘Hi, I’m your mum, come up and see me every other weekend and we’ll have a roast.’ Just be a normal mum.” But that’s not what happened; nor was she just a normal mum. She was, in Hornigold’s words, “a destroyer of lives”.\n\nHornigold replied to the email with some questions – What was his middle name? Where exactly was he born? – all of which Dionne answered correctly. She had recently flown in from Bangkok and they met at a hotel in Liverpool. “Hello, my darling.” A beaming Asian woman in her mid-80s reached up from the sofa. They embraced, making skin-­on-skin contact for the first time since he was a baby.\n\nHornigold is initially quite guarded, not one to pour his heart out to some bloke from the Guardian he has known for five minutes. I ask him how that was, a hug with his mum after 45 years. “It’s like if you’ve got a DIY job and you can’t find your drill for ever, then you do, it’s a bit like that.” He has another go, digs a little deeper. “I mean, it was kind of surreal, but good, yeah.” Good how? “Like you were transported, you feel a sense of belonging you hadn’t felt before, when you don’t know your roots. Everyone wants to know their history.”\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘I was blinded by the fact that she had come into my life again’: Graham Hornigold with his mother Dionne. Photograph: courtesy of Netflix\n\nThen the pragmatist returns, noting the practical advantages of knowing your mum. “Like when you’re at the doctor’s and they ask: is there a history of X, Y or Z?”\n\nIt does look as if he has been transported to childhood, the one he never had. Kaniuk filmed that first encounter; there’s footage of them getting to know each other. It has been used in a forthcoming Netflix documentary, stitched together with interviews. A friend of Hornigold’s says Graham was like a little kid with Dionne; a baby, born again. The documentary is called Con Mum.\n\nThe first bombshell dropped early, at that meeting in Liverpool. Dionne told Hornigold she had a brain tumour and bone marrow cancer, and had only six months to live – that was why she had come to find him. “So it was a bit bittersweet. I’d just had her come into my life; now she was being taken away again.”\n\nSuddenly there was a lot to juggle in Hornigold’s life: the baby on the way, plus a new mother, who wouldn’t be around for long, and a global pandemic making logistics difficult. But having found his mother, he wanted to spend as much time with her as they had left.\n\nDionne – a cuddly but frail 85-year-old with a big smile – was something of a tycoon. She told Hornigold she had been living in Singapore and had businesses – fruit farms and palm oil plantations – in Malaysia (where she was born) and Indonesia. She was on the phone the whole time, talking to people all over the world in multiple languages, and she had a taste for the high life. She suggested she come to London and checked into a five-star hotel, living on the finest champagne and caviar. There were two sources of her wealth, she told Hornigold: her business acumen, and being the illegitimate child of the former sultan of Brunei. It sounded implausible but he wondered if that was why, when they went to the Dorchester hotel, she was treated so well: he knew the Dorchester is owned by the royal family of Brunei.\n\nHornigold says any parent wants to be able to provide some financial security for their children, but maintains he wasn’t thinking much about the money. “I’ve just had her come into my life, and all you care about at the time was to get to know her, so I could get to know me.”\n\nView image in fullscreen With former partner Heather Kaniuk. His mother, Hornigold says, was ‘the catalyst’ for their breakup. Photograph: courtesy of Netflix\n\nStill, he wasn’t complaining when Dionne bought him a car, a new Range Rover, to make up for all the presents she hadn’t bought him over the years. Then she bought Kaniuk a car, a BMW, so she didn’t feel left out.\n\nIn September 2020, Kaniuk gave birth to a baby boy. But then Dionne seemed to take a turn for the worse, texting Hornigold from her hotel a picture of the blood she had passed in the loo. Further juggling was required: he moved her into the family home in Kent, which caused tensions. Kaniuk says in the documentary that Dionne’s attitude changed after the birth: she started criticising Kaniuk, complaining she wasn’t getting time with her grandson. “That sense of ‘I’ve just become a mum’ was robbed from me, because there’s Dionne,” she says.\n\nA couple of months after the birth, Dionne and Hornigold began to discuss going to Switzerland to meet with a banker and a lawyer, and sign the documents that would enable Hornigold to inherit her considerable wealth. He would need a Swiss bank account, she said.\n\nIn Zurich, her high living continued: an expensive hotel, restaurants, champagne, more champagne. There were meetings with a banker and a lawyer, but no documents were signed; apparently there were hold-ups in accessing the money, because of Covid. The days turned into weeks. Hornigold missed his new son, but at least he was spending his mother’s last days with her. They met people whose businesses Dionne agreed to invest in: a couple with a startup selling high-end products, a middle man looking for investment in a new cancer treatment. She would invest, she told them, but, again, she couldn’t access her funds right now. Could they help her out, and not tell Hornigold?\n\nShe was very good at doing that: getting money from people to bankroll her extravagant lifestyle without others finding out. But the truth was becoming clear to Kaniuk and to Hornigold’s friend Juan, who happened to be living in Zurich. Kaniuk discovered Hornigold had moved money out of their joint account to give to his mother and had set up credit cards in his own name to pay the bills – £20,000 for the Zurich hotel, the same in London, more when they came back. It turned out this had started soon after they first met. It hit Kaniuk that Dionne had made it look as if she had paid for everything when in fact they had, because Hornigold thought the money would come back tenfold, or more.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘I’m a master at spotting BS now.’ Photograph: Manuel Vazquez/The Guardian\n\nThe wedge Dionne was driving between them was banged in further. “She was trying to get me out of the picture,” Kaniuk says in the documentary. And the cars? She found out monthly payments for them were coming out of her and Hornigold’s joint account. In total, he had run up debts of around £300,000.\n\nKaniuk had been trying to book for them to go to New Zealand to introduce their son to her family, but Dionne was trying to stop Hornigold going. Convinced his mum was about to die, he decided to stay. So Kaniuk and their son went without him. “I needed to see my family and be around people who loved me,” she says.\n\nThe penny finally began to drop for Hornigold after Juan sat him down over a bottle of wine and told him he didn’t think Dionne was dying, that she was a scammer and he needed to snap out of the trance she had put him under. Around the same time, in a drawer in her hotel suite, Hornigold came across the red food dye she must have poured into the loo to look like blood.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Money, and greed, are behind most scams. Again, he says it wasn’t about the money. He admits to being blinded, but “blinded by the fact that my mum had come into my life and she was going to be leaving again”.\n\nPeople who are searching for love often fall for scams, and that Hornigold does admit to. “Yeah, absolutely. That was my downfall. If you don’t receive it when you’re a kid, you have this wound you carry around … Can you honestly tell me the bond between you and your mother you haven’t seen in 45 years and who is dying wouldn’t be stronger than anything else?” Hearing Hornigold’s account, it is hard to believe a mother would do that to her son. As Kaniuk says, “it goes against everything you think a mother should do – loving and protecting a child. She didn’t do any of that; she effectively destroyed her child’s life. With no remorse.”\n\nThere are unanswered questions in the documentary. The farms and plantations – was any of that true? Dionne was certainly on the phone a lot; the banker and lawyer were real. She must have had some money, though had she scammed it from other people? “You can speculate,” Hornigold says, “but you just don’t know, do you?”\n\nKaniuk did her own detective work: she spoke to a man in Indonesia who had paid Dionne $40,000 for a hajj pilgrimage to Mecca that never materialised. How many others had she scammed that way? Kaniuk found records of scams Dionne had committed in the UK: convictions for shoplifting and obtaining property by deception. “God, I wish I knew this before,” Hornigold says. “I can understand you’re this type of person, but to do it to your own son – that’s what I don’t understand.”\n\nIs there a possibility Dionne really is the illegitimate child of the former sultan of Brunei and Hornigold his grandson? “We’ll never know,” he says.\n\nWhen they first met, Dionne didn’t want to do a DNA test. “There’s no need,” she’d told him. “You either believe me or you don’t.” But then, after pressure from friends, Hornigold persuaded her: “Part of me didn’t want to be related,” he says.\n\nHe knew the answer before the results came through. To be honest, watching the film, I knew the answer; you can see the likeness between their faces. Sure enough, it is 99.9% certain Dionne is his mother.\n\nView image in fullscreen In new documentary Con Mum – a title Hornigold says is fair and accurate. Photograph: courtesy of Netflix\n\nCon Mum, indeed (a title Hornigold thinks is fair and accurate). But their relationship made the situation difficult legally: when Kaniuk went to the police, she was told Dionne’s activities wouldn’t be seen as fraud, because she is his mother. Hornigold has looked into it: “Essentially they call it a bad business decision, because you know where the money is going and who to.”\n\nA little over a year after smashing into Hornigold’s life like a wrecking ball, Dionne returned to Malaysia. There’s a moment in the film where she calls him on the phone: “I love you, son, I’m sorry for what happened.”\n\n“Really?” Hornigold says, sarcastically but, remarkably, without anger. “It was kind of life-changing, Mum.”\n\n“I’ve done what I’ve done, son. I cannot change, son.”\n\n“You take care, yeah? I need to go.”\n\nThat call was a while ago. Hornigold, who has become more open as we’ve talked, now describes the year when his mother came back into his life as “frenzied, anxious, mind-bogglingly painful, in the sense that your brain hurt all the time. It was just darkness.” He felt suicidal. “One minute you’ve got everything; the next you’ve got nothing, and on the spin of a knife you’re deciding whether you’re going to stay alive or not. And if you don’t seek help, you’ll keep attracting this cycle.”\n\nHornigold did seek help. “I’ve done the head work, sorted out the inner demons.” That’s the message he’d like to get across and partly why he did the documentary: mental health is real; get help and you can fix it.\n\nIs he more wary now? “I’d like to think I’m a bit more clued up. I was pretty good at spotting BS before, now I’m a master at it,” he laughs.\n\nHornigold’s son is now on the other side of the world: Kaniuk never came back from New Zealand. He thinks if it hadn’t been for his mother, they would still be together: “She was the catalyst.”\n\nAlthough he misses his son desperately, being able to pull up a picture of him on his smartwatch has kept him going through dark moments. He recognises the parallels with his own childhood, growing up without a parent – “Yeah, it’s continuing the cycle” – but this is different. He describes his mother as “a bad person at her core”; his dad wasn’t great, either, whereas Hornigold is, he jokes, “an all-round good guy”. Is he, though, seriously? “I am, yeah,” he confirms, only half-joking now. He video chats with his son and plans to visit as soon as he can afford to. He is still heavily in debt, but has his business, and a home. “I won’t let it affect him, in the sense that he won’t see his dad. I’m going to be a big part of his life.”\n\nHornigold doesn’t know where Dionne is now – Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia – and when Netflix approached her for comment, she didn’t respond. He hasn’t spoken to her for three years. I wonder if he thinks that, in spite of everything, she loves him? “No.” Is she capable of love? “No.” Does he have any love for her? “Apart from the fact that she brought me into the world, no.” He refers to her as Dionne rather than Mum now; “sometimes something else”, more explicit. It hurts, but Graham Hornigold has come to accept that he doesn’t have a mother.",

        "content": "Israel carried out a strike in Tyre, south Lebanon, on Saturday, killing one and wounding seven people and endangering the shaky truce that ended a year-long conflict against Hezbollah, as 40 survivors of Hamas captivity called on the Israeli government to halt the “endless war”.\n\nThe strike on a building in the city came after Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes in Lebanon on Saturday, its most intense aerial assault on the country in four months. In total, six people were killed, including a child, and 28 injured, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.\n\nIsrael’s strikes were the deadliest in Lebanon since the 27 November ceasefire which had put an end to 13 months of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. The strike on Tyre, in particular, one of the largest cities in south Lebanon and far from the Lebanese border, was a major escalation and threatened to upend the fragile ceasefire agreement.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesperson said it had targeted “attack command headquarters, terrorist operatives, missile launchers, and a weapons depot of the terrorist Hezbollah”.\n\nThe wave of Israeli airstrikes was triggered by the launching of three rockets from Lebanon by unknown groups, which were intercepted by the Israeli air force.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday afternoon, Hezbollah denied any involvement in the rocket attacks and stressed its commitment to the ceasefire agreement. It added that Israeli claims that it was behind the strikes were “merely a pretext for continued attacks on Lebanon”.\n\nA variety of Palestinian factions, as well as other armed groups, operate in southern Lebanon and not all are under Hezbollah’s command. Both the Israeli military and the Lebanese Ministry of Defence said it was investigating who could have fired the rockets.\n\nThe Lebanese army said it found and dismantled what it called three “primitive rocket launchers” in south Lebanon after the rocket fire towards Israel. Pictures released by the army showed fragments of bombs and three wooden posts dug into the earth, seemingly used in the launching of the rockets.\n\nLebanon’s minister of defence, Michel Menassa, said the country was “continuing its diplomatic, political and military efforts to ensure Lebanon’s sovereignty”.\n\nThe Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, warned of a severe response to the rocket fire, which was shot at the Israeli border village of Metula.\n\n\n\n“Metula and Beirut will be treated the same. The Lebanese government is fully responsible for any fire originating from its territory,” Katz said.\n\nView image in fullscreen An Israeli soldier stands above the Israeli border town of Metula. Photograph: Avi Ohayon/Reuters\n\nThe ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has stopped full-scale military hostilities between the two warring parties, though Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes on Lebanon despite the truce. Israel has maintained that it reserves the right to unilaterally enforce any violations of the ceasefire in Lebanon and has continued to strike what it says are Hezbollah targets across the country.\n\nHezbollah launched rockets near an Israeli military post in the week after the establishment of the ceasefire, but otherwise has not attacked Israel since. The group has been severely weakened after its war with Israel, with most of its senior leadership dead, thousands of its fighters killed and its weapons stock depleted.\n\nThe Lebanese prime minister, Nawaf Salam, warned on Saturday that renewed military operations in south Lebanon could risk dragging the country back into war and urged the ministry of defence to ensure that the Lebanese state, rather than Hezbollah, decides whether Lebanon goes to war.\n\nUnifil, the UN peacekeeping force that monitors the Israel-Lebanon border, warned against further military escalation that could lead to the ceasefire being broken.\n\n“The situation remains extremely fragile and we encourage both sides to uphold their commitments,” it said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nIn Israel, several thousand protesters took to the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem on Saturday, blocking key highways across the country in a demonstration against Netanyahu’s government.\n\nThe immediate trigger for the anger was the government’s attempt to dismiss Ronen Bar, the head of the internal security agency, a move described as an attempt to undermine Israel’s democratic system, but the prime minister’s decision to shatter a two-month-old truce in Gaza with waves of lethal airstrikes has also fuelled the demonstrations.\n\nForty freed hostages of Hamas captivity and 250 family members of Israeli soldiers and civilians still held in Gaza signed a letter on Friday calling on Netanyahu to halt Israel’s renewed military activities and return to the negotiating table in order to secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages who are still in the territory. In a letter sent to the prime minister, they warned that failure to do so would condemn the living hostages to death.\n\n“This letter was written in blood and tears,” the text reads. ‘‘It was drafted by our friends and families whose loved ones were killed and murdered in captivity and who are crying out: ‘Stop the fighting. Return to the negotiating table and fully complete an agreement that will return all of the hostages, even at the cost of ending the war’.”\n\nThe signatories attacked the government for “choosing an endless war over saving and returning the hostages, and by doing that, sacrificing them. This is a criminal policy – you do not have a mandate to sacrifice 59 people.’’\n\nThe letter comes as Israel’s defence minister on Friday said he had instructed the military to “seize more ground” in Gaza and threatened to annex part of the territory unless Hamas released Israeli hostages still held in the devastated territory.\n\nIsraeli officials have escalated their threats in recent days, calling on Palestinians in Gaza to overthrow Hamas or face the consequences.\n\nView image in fullscreen Israeli soldiers stand at the Israeli side of the Israel-Lebanon border. Photograph: Avi Ohayon/Reuters\n\n“I ordered [the army] to seize more territory in Gaza,” Katz said in a statement. “The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel.”\n\nGaza’s civil defence agency said more than 500 people had been killed since the bombardment resumed, one of the highest tolls since the war began more than 17 months ago with Hamas’s attack on Israel.\n\nA three-phase ceasefire was agreed in January but Israel refused to begin talks on the implementation of a second phase, which was supposed to lead to a return of all hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a permanent end to hostilities.\n\nInstead, Israel proposed a new plan, reportedly put forward by the US envoy, Steve Witkoff, involving a 30- to 60-day truce and the release of all remaining hostages. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners – a key component of the first phase.\n\nOn Saturday, the Fatah movement of Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, called on Hamas to relinquish power in order to safeguard the “existence” of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\n\n“Hamas must show compassion for Gaza, its children, women and men,” Fatah spokesperson Monther al-Hayek said in a message sent to AFP, urging the militant group to “step aside from governing and fully recognise that the battle ahead will lead to the end of Palestinians’ existence” if it remains in power in Gaza.\n\nHamas said on Friday it was still debating Witkoff’s proposal and other proposals made by intermediaries, including Egypt.\n\nThe intense fighting comes as Netanyahu is locked in a fierce battle with Israel’s judicial system after the supreme court blocked his attempt to fire the head of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency, who has been investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media, and allegedly taking money from Qatar, which is known to have given significant financial aid to Hamas.\n\nAmid protests against ministers’ vote to sack Bar, the top court on Friday froze the decision, with the order remaining in place until the court can hear petitions filed by the opposition and an NGO against the dismissal.\n\nNetanyahu said in a post on X that “the government of Israel will decide” who headed the domestic security agency, writing: “The State of Israel is a state of law, and according to the law, the government of Israel decides who will be the head of the Shin Bet.”\n\nAbout 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, died in the surprise attack by Hamas in October 2023. The ensuing Israeli offensive into Gaza has killed more than 49,000 people, mostly civilians.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "In Gaza this weekend, the mood is darker than it has been at perhaps any time in this long, appalling war. Last Tuesday Israeli warplanes, tanks, artillery, drones and ships launched a wave of strikes, shattering the increasingly fragile pause in hostilities that had brought respite to the devastated territory for nearly two months. The ceasefire had also brought hope which, Palestinians in Gaza said, made the return to violence that much more unbearable.\n\nIn a video statement last Wednesday, Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, called on 2.3 million people in Gaza to “banish Hamas”, saying “the alternative is complete destruction and ruin”.\n\nTwo days later, as air strikes continued and the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) seized a key strategic corridor that divides Gaza, Katz issued a new ultimatum, this time telling Hamas to give up the 59 hostages it is still holding or “lose more and more land that will be added to Israel”. He said that the IDF would use “all military and civilian pressure, including … implementing US President Trump’s voluntary migration plan for Gaza residents”.\n\nThese last lines were important. A second phase of the ceasefire deal agreed in January was supposed to start three weeks ago and lead to an eventual definitive end to the war. A principal reason for Israel ditching this plan in favour of a 30- to 60-day truce with no such endpoint is that Israel’s most senior policymakers feel not just empowered but even inspired by the new incumbent of the Oval Office.\n\nThe Israeli government has adopted Trump’s lexicon of internal enemies. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, last week railed against the leftist deep state that supposedly opposes the will of the Israeli people.\n\nTrump’s loud proposal to displace the entire population in Gaza so it can be turned into the “Riviera of the Middle East” has made the previously unspoken desire of many increasingly influential actors in Israel into a project that can be publicly discussed – and even possibly realised in the relative short term.\n\nKatz’s threats echo Trump’s almost word for word. “To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD,” the US president posted earlier this month.\n\nHistorians may well see the return of Trump to the White House as the inflection point in this current war.\n\nIts first phase began with the horrors of the October 2023 surprise attack, when 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed by Hamas militants who attacked communities in southern Israel. Hundreds, young and old, were gunned down in their homes or at a music festival. More than 250 were dragged back into Gaza as hostages.This phase then continued through the first months of the hugely destructive and lethal Israeli reaction. A relentless military offensive killed some 29,000 people within four months. Families were wiped out by single strikes on homes. A tight blockade imposed on Gaza by Israel meant growing shortages of everything from cooking oil to anaesthetics. A single truce lasted 10 days.\n\nA second phase of the war lasted almost a year, with periods of intense and deadly but often localised Israeli military operations. Gaza was plunged into an acute and protracted humanitarian crisis. There were marchers around the world but international outrage had only a marginal effect. Palestinians in the devastated territory survived as best they could, moving from ruined town to crowded tented camps and back to the rubble of their former homes in a desperate bid to avoid missiles, shells, shrapnel and starvation. There was no realistic plan for a “day after”, and few could envisage one.\n\nThe pause in hostilities in mid-January, which initially led to a degree of hope, may now be seen as the relative calm before a brutal new phase of the conflict. The threats of Katz, Trump and Netanyahu suggest what is coming next.\n\nGeneral Eyal Zamir, the new chief of staff of the IDF, has told Netanyahu that the only way to achieve Israel’s avowed war aims of destroying Hamas and returning the hostages in Gaza is through massive and completely unrestrained force involving large numbers of troops on the ground, say well-informed Israeli experts. This is what the prime minister and his cabinet, particularly those drawn from Israel’s surging far right, want to hear.\n\nIt is also what some Israeli strategic analysts and military experts have been arguing since the start of the war. A year ago, those saying that a military administration of Gaza – with the IDF controlling aid supplies and the population– was inevitable were ignored. But that is not the case now.\n\nThe plan to seize much of Gaza and “reorder its space in a more favourable way”, in the words of one Jerusalem-based expert who backs the military administration plan, also matches the thinking of the far right in Israel who see a chance now to at least partially empty Gaza of Palestinians. One way to do this is by making it unliveable and then finding some way to allow inhabitants to leave. There are military and political officials in Israel currently looking at ways of encouraging “legal immigration” – even if, given conditions in Gaza, any migration would almost certainly be illegal under international law.\n\nThe wave of air strikes last Tuesday came in a brief 10-minute period just after 2am, and appear to have primarily targeted middle-ranking and some senior Hamas political and military officials, of whom many were at home asleep with their often large families. This explains, to some extent, the apparently high proportion of women and children among the 400 casualties. Israeli officials have spoken of striking 80 “terrorist” targets.\n\nNetanyahu described the wave of strikes as “just a beginning”. The Israeli prime minister has been guilty of speaking many untruths during this war. It is fair to assume this was not one of them.",

        "content": "A veteran FBI agent who blew the whistle on alleged political bias during Donald Trump’s first presidency was arrested at New York’s JFK airport moments before boarding an international flight.\n\nJohnathan Buma, a 15-year counterintelligence officer and eventual whistleblower, now faces charges of illegally disclosing classified information through a prospective tell-all book about his career.\n\nFederal prosecutors allege Buma systematically harvested confidential materials from the bureau’s internal systems, printing approximately 130 files clearly marked with security warnings in October 2023 before going on leave.\n\nHe allegedly shared draft portions of a book manuscript via email that contained information about “the FBI’s efforts and investigations into a foreign country’s weapons of mass destruction (‘WMD’) program”, the filing reads.\n\nDuring a Brooklyn federal court hearing on Tuesday, Buma was released on $100,000 bail, though the case will be handled in California federal court. He has not entered a plea.\n\nThe investigation into the FBI agent began during the Biden administration, when his home was raided in late 2023.\n\nThat year, Buma told Business Insider about what he described as differential treatment of politically sensitive cases. He described an incident during which he allegedly presented information about potential criminal actions involving Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma to a supervisor at the Los Angeles field office – prompting his boss to advance the case. Then when he went to raise concerns in the same meeting that the former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani might have been compromised in a Russian counter-influence operation, Buma says his superior moved to immediately dismiss the matter altogether.\n\nIn a semi-redacted statement to the Senate in 2023, Buma explained how he was “at my wits’ end” and filed a whistleblower complaint in January 2022 alleging “numerous acts of intelligence suppression” related to his reporting on foreign intelligence matters. The complaint also claimed he faced retaliation for voicing his concerns, and he filed an Equal Employment Opportunities complaint later that year.\n\nFollowing the October 2023 raid on Buma’s home, his attorney Scott Horton denied any wrongdoing and claimed no classified information was found.",

Advocates have raised concerns that the more aggressive efforts could infringe on the rights of immigrants and US citizens alike.\n\nWhite House officials are reviewing federal agencies’ downsizing plans, a move expected to result in the mass firing of thousands of government workers within the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Friday.\n\nTrump had given the agencies until 13 March to draw up plans for a second wave of mass layoffs as part of his rapid-fire effort to reshape and reduce the size of the federal government, which he has called bloated and inefficient.\n\nThe DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties investigates potential rights violations within the department and fields complaints from the public.\n\nThe other two offices targeted were the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which served similar oversight functions.\n\nThousands of workers fired in Trump’s effort to slash the government workforce have sued to have their jobs reinstated by federal judges.",

It has also targeted at least three law firms that the president says helped his political opponents or helped prosecute him unfairly.\n\nAmong the most contentious of the nine demands, Columbia agreed to place its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department under a new official, the memo said, taking control away from its faculty.\n\n“In this role, the Senior Vice Provost will review the educational programs to ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced,” the memo read, explaining that the review would start with the Center for Palestine Studies; the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies; the Middle East Institute; and other university programs focused on the Middle East.\n\nThe new official would also be in control of the review process for hiring the university’s non-tenured staff and for approving curricular changes.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania and a “proud” graduate of Columbia, called it a sad day for the university.\n\n“Historically, there is no precedent for this,” Zimmerman said. “The government is using the money as a cudgel to micromanage a university.”\n\nZimmerman said the White House actions had apparently already had a chilling effect on higher education because officials at other universities failed to band together and speak out.\n\nThe White House had yet to respond to Columbia’s memo as of Friday evening, and the status of the funding remained unclear.\n\nThe sudden shutdown of millions of dollars in federal funding to Columbia University this month had already been disrupting medical and scientific research at the school, researchers said.\n\nScientists and doctors who had been awarded grants by the National Institutes of Health after months or years of work described receiving unusual notices by email last week saying their projects had been terminated because of “unsafe antisemitic actions”.\n\nCanceled projects included the development of an AI-based tool to help nurses detect the deterioration of a patient’s health in hospital two days earlier than other early warning systems.\n\nThe administration also canceled funding for a study designed to improve the safety of blood-transfusion therapies for adults, children and newborns, and research on uterine fibroids, which are non-cancerous tumors that can cause pain and affect women’s fertility.\n\nThe demand had raised alarm among professors at Columbia and elsewhere, who worried that permitting the federal government to dictate how a department is run would set a dangerous precedent.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives last year criticized at least two professors of Palestinian descent working in the department for their comments about the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe school has also hired three dozen special officers who have the power to arrest people on campus and has revised its anti-discrimination policies, including its authority to sanction campus organizations, the memo said.\n\nFace masks to conceal identities are no longer allowed, and any protesters must now identify themselves when asked, the memo said.\n\nThe school also said it is searching for new faculty members to “ensure intellectual diversity”. Columbia plans to fill joint positions in the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies and the international affairs school in an effort to ensure “excellence and fairness in Middle East studies”, the memo said. The sudden shutdown of millions of dollars in federal funding to Columbia University this month was already disrupting medical and scientific research at the school, researchers said.\n\nColumbia has come under particular scrutiny, following the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled its campus last year, when its lawns filled with tent encampments and noisy rallies against the US government’s support of Israel.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives last year criticized at least two professors of Palestinian descent working in Columbia’s Middle Eastern studies department for their comments about the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.",

You can easily swap them with chickpeas or other legumes. Look online for a quick guide on how to spatchcock a chicken. It really is very simple and it makes the chicken cook evenly. All you need is a pair of heavy-duty scissors or standard garden secateurs.\n\nPrep 15 min\n\nCook 1hr 10 min\n\nServes 4-6\n\n1 whole chicken (2.3–2.5kg), spatchcocked\n\n8 garlic cloves, crushed\n\n1 tsp ground turmeric\n\n150ml olive oil\n\nFine sea salt and black pepper\n\n2 x 700g jars butter beans, drained\n\n20g oregano\n\n150g round shallots, peeled and cut in half\n\n1 cinnamon stick\n\n1 lemon, cut in half\n\n\n\nPreheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.\n\nPlace the chicken in a large, high-sided tray (about 30cm x 38cm). Mix the garlic, turmeric and olive oil in a bowl with two teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Rub three-quarters of this mixture all over the chicken and under the skin. Scatter the beans, oregano and shallots around the chicken and nestle the cinnamon among them.\n\nAdd the remainder of the garlic, turmeric and oil mixture to 100ml water and pour over the beans and shallots, mixing well. Generously crack over some black pepper and add the lemon halves to the tray.\n\nPlace in the oven and roast for one hour, until the beans have burst and are crispy in places. Increase the heat to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and cook for another 10 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is golden and crispy.\n\nSet aside to rest for 10 minutes and serve with the lemon squeezed on top.\n\nRoast potatoes with peppers and garlic\n\nView image in fullscreen Food Styling: Ellie Mulligan.

They go well with the roast chicken, but you can also serve them with grilled aubergine halves and a drizzle of tahini sauce.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 45 min\n\nServes 6\n\n\n\n1kg baby potatoes, cut in half lengthways\n\n10g thyme\n\n9 garlic cloves, skin on\n\n120ml olive oil\n\n440g whole Piccerella peppers, or 2-3 bell peppers, cut in 3cm strips\n\nFlaked sea salt and black pepper\n\nPlace the potatoes with half of the thyme and three garlic cloves in a saucepan and cover with plenty of well salted water. Bring to the boil on a high heat, then reduce to medium-high, and cook for five minutes until a knife goes through them easily, then drain.\n\nPreheat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/325F/gas 4.\n\nAdd the potatoes with all of the garlic (both boiled and raw), thyme and oil to a large tray with a good grind of black pepper. Mix well to coat and place in the oven for 30 minutes, until golden with dark patches in places.\n\nIncrease the heat to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, stir in the peppers with half a teaspoon of salt, mix and roast for 10-15 minutes until the peppers have blistered and softened.\n\nRemove from the oven and serve hot.",

        "content": "Since Donald Trump returned to the White House, he has carried out the hardline immigration policies he promised on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump’s administration sent immigrants to the Guantánamo Bay naval base in Cuba – with little access to legal counsel – and singled out two pro-Palestinian academics for deportation. The administration also failed to return El Salvador-destined deportation flights in potential violation of a court order.\n\nBut in recent weeks, immigration authorities have also repeatedly detained US-bound tourists at the border, sparking public and diplomatic outrage abroad and fears among many people planning trips to the US, or living in the country on visas.\n\nExamples have made global headlines. A British woman said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detained her for three weeks after a mixup at the US-Canada border. Canadian businesswoman and actor Jasmine Mooney said she was detained by Ice for two weeks. Jessica Brösche, a 29-year-old tattoo artist from Germany, was held in immigration detention for six weeks before returning home.\n\nThere’s suspicion that in some cases people were turned away over anti-Trump views. Among them is a French scientist who was denied entry after immigration officers at an airport found messages on his phone that were critical of Trump, France’s minister of higher education said.\n\nWith serious concerns growing about whether visitors can safely travel to the US without fear of landing in immigration detention, here is a brief guide to international visitors’ rights.",

        "content": "There was no explanation, no warning. One minute, I was in an immigration office talking to an officer about my work visa, which had been approved months before and allowed me, a Canadian, to work in the US. The next, I was told to put my hands against the wall, and patted down like a criminal before being sent to an Ice detention center without the chance to talk to a lawyer.\n\nI grew up in Whitehorse, Yukon, a small town in the northernmost part of Canada. I always knew I wanted to do something bigger with my life. I left home early and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where I built a career spanning multiple industries – acting in film and television, owning bars and restaurants, flipping condos and managing Airbnbs.\n\nIn my 30s, I found my true passion working in the health and wellness industry. I was given the opportunity to help launch an American brand of health tonics called Holy! Water – a job that would involve moving to the US.\n\nI was granted my trade Nafta work visa, which allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the US in specific professional occupations, on my second attempt. It goes without saying, then, that I have no criminal record. I also love the US and consider myself to be a kind, hard-working person.\n\nI started working in California and travelled back and forth between Canada and the US multiple times without any complications – until one day, upon returning to the US, a border officer questioned me about my initial visa denial and subsequent visa approval. He asked why I had gone to the San Diego border the second time to apply. I explained that that was where my lawyer’s offices were, and that he had wanted to accompany me to ensure there were no issues.\n\nAfter a long interrogation, the officer told me it seemed “shady” and that my visa hadn’t been properly processed. He claimed I also couldn’t work for a company in the US that made use of hemp – one of the beverage ingredients. He revoked my visa, and told me I could still work for the company from Canada, but if I wanted to return to the US, I would need to reapply.\n\nI was devastated; I had just started building a life in California. I stayed in Canada for the next few months, and was eventually offered a similar position with a different health and wellness brand.\n\nI restarted the visa process and returned to the same immigration office at the San Diego border, since they had processed my visa before and I was familiar with it. Hours passed, with many confused opinions about my case. The officer I spoke to was kind but told me that, due to my previous issues, I needed to apply for my visa through the consulate. I told her I hadn’t been aware I needed to apply that way, but had no problem doing it.\n\nThen she said something strange: “You didn’t do anything wrong. You are not in trouble, you are not a criminal.”\n\nI remember thinking: Why would she say that? Of course I’m not a criminal!\n\nShe then told me they had to send me back to Canada. That didn’t concern me; I assumed I would simply book a flight home. But as I sat searching for flights, a man approached me.\n\n“Come with me,” he said.\n\nThere was no explanation, no warning. He led me to a room, took my belongings from my hands and ordered me to put my hands against the wall. A woman immediately began patting me down. The commands came rapid-fire, one after another, too fast to process.\n\nThey took my shoes and pulled out my shoelaces.\n\n“What are you doing? What is happening?” I asked.\n\n“You are being detained.”\n\n“I don’t understand. What does that mean? For how long?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nThat would be the response to nearly every question I would ask over the next two weeks: “I don’t know.”\n\nThey brought me downstairs for a series of interviews and medical questions, searched my bags and told me I had to get rid of half my belongings because I couldn’t take everything with me.\n\n“Take everything with me where?” I asked.\n\nA woman asked me for the name of someone they could contact on my behalf. In moments like this, you realize you don’t actually know anyone’s phone number anymore. By some miracle, I had recently memorized my best friend Britt’s number because I had been putting my grocery points on her account.\n\nI gave them her phone number.\n\nThey handed me a mat and a folded-up sheet of aluminum foil.\n\n“What is this?”\n\n“Your blanket.”\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\nI was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.\n\nView image in fullscreen A border patrol agent watches as girls from Central America sleep under thermal blankets at a detention facility in McAllen, Texas, on 8 September 2014. Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images\n\nFor two days, we remained in that cell, only leaving briefly for food. The lights never turned off, we never knew what time it was and no one answered our questions. No one in the cell spoke English, so I either tried to sleep or meditate to keep from having a breakdown. I didn’t trust the food, so I fasted, assuming I wouldn’t be there long.\n\nOn the third day, I was finally allowed to make a phone call. I called Britt and told her that I didn’t understand what was happening, that no one would tell me when I was going home, and that she was my only contact.\n\nThey gave me a stack of paperwork to sign and told me I was being given a five-year ban unless I applied for re-entry through the consulate. The officer also said it didn’t matter whether I signed the papers or not; it was happening regardless.\n\nI was so delirious that I just signed. I told them I would pay for my flight home and asked when I could leave.\n\nNo answer.\n\nThen they moved me to another cell – this time with no mat or blanket. I sat on the freezing cement floor for hours. That’s when I realized they were processing me into real jail: the Otay Mesa Detention Center.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Otay Mesa Detention Center in Otay Mesa, California, on 9 May 2020. Photograph: Sandy Huffaker/AFP/Getty Images\n\nI was told to shower, given a jail uniform, fingerprinted and interviewed. I begged for information.\n\n“How long will I be here?”\n\n“I don’t know your case,” the man said. “Could be days. Could be weeks. But I’m telling you right now – you need to mentally prepare yourself for months.”\n\nMonths.\n\nI felt like I was going to throw up.\n\nI was taken to the nurse’s office for a medical check. She asked what had happened to me. She had never seen a Canadian there before. When I told her my story, she grabbed my hand and said: “Do you believe in God?”\n\nI told her I had only recently found God, but that I now believed in God more than anything.\n\n“I believe God brought you here for a reason,” she said. “I know it feels like your life is in a million pieces, but you will be OK. Through this, I think you are going to find a way to help others.”\n\nAt the time, I didn’t know what that meant. She asked if she could pray for me. I held her hands and wept.\n\nI felt like I had been sent an angel.\n\nI was then placed in a real jail unit: two levels of cells surrounding a common area, just like in the movies. I was put in a tiny cell alone with a bunk bed and a toilet.\n\nThe best part: there were blankets. After three days without one, I wrapped myself in mine and finally felt some comfort.\n\nFor the first day, I didn’t leave my cell. I continued fasting, terrified that the food might make me sick. The only available water came from the tap attached to the toilet in our cells or a sink in the common area, neither of which felt safe to drink.\n\nEventually, I forced myself to step out, meet the guards and learn the rules. One of them told me: “No fighting.”\n\n“I’m a lover, not a fighter,” I joked. He laughed.\n\nI asked if there had ever been a fight here.\n\n“In this unit? No,” he said. “No one in this unit has a criminal record.”\n\nThat’s when I started meeting the other women.\n\nThat’s when I started hearing their stories.\n\nView image in fullscreen Women sit on their beds in a privately run 1,000-bed detention center on 28 February 2006 in Otay Mesa, California. Photograph: Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\nAnd that’s when I made a decision: I would never allow myself to feel sorry for my situation again. No matter how hard this was, I had to be grateful. Because every woman I met was in an even more difficult position than mine.\n\nThere were around 140 of us in our unit. Many women had lived and worked in the US legally for years but had overstayed their visas – often after reapplying and being denied. They had all been detained without warning.\n\nIf someone is a criminal, I agree they should be taken off the streets. But not one of these women had a criminal record. These women acknowledged that they shouldn’t have overstayed and took responsibility for their actions. But their frustration wasn’t about being held accountable; it was about the endless, bureaucratic limbo they had been trapped in.\n\nThe real issue was how long it took to get out of the system, with no clear answers, no timeline and no way to move forward. Once deported, many have no choice but to abandon everything they own because the cost of shipping their belongings back is too high.\n\nI met a woman who had been on a road trip with her husband. She said they had 10-year work visas. While driving near the San Diego border, they mistakenly got into a lane leading to Mexico. They stopped and told the agent they didn’t have their passports on them, expecting to be redirected. Instead, they were detained. They are both pastors.\n\nI met a family of three who had been living in the US for 11 years with work authorizations. They paid taxes and were waiting for their green cards. Every year, the mother had to undergo a background check, but this time, she was told to bring her whole family. When they arrived, they were taken into custody and told their status would now be processed from within the detention center.\n\nAnother woman from Canada had been living in the US with her husband who was detained after a traffic stop. She admitted she had overstayed her visa and accepted that she would be deported. But she had been stuck in the system for almost six weeks because she hadn’t had her passport. Who runs casual errands with their passport?\n\nOne woman had a 10-year visa. When it expired, she moved back to her home country, Venezuela. She admitted she had overstayed by one month before leaving. Later, she returned for a vacation and entered the US without issue. But when she took a domestic flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she was picked up by Ice and detained. She couldn’t be deported because Venezuela wasn’t accepting deportees. She didn’t know when she was getting out.\n\nThere was a girl from India who had overstayed her student visa for three days before heading back home. She then came back to the US on a new, valid visa to finish her master’s degree and was handed over to Ice due to the three days she had overstayed on her previous visa.\n\nThere were women who had been picked up off the street, from outside their workplaces, from their homes. All of these women told me that they had been detained for time spans ranging from a few weeks to 10 months. One woman’s daughter was outside the detention center protesting for her release.\n\nThat night, the pastor invited me to a service she was holding. A girl who spoke English translated for me as the women took turns sharing their prayers – prayers for their sick parents, for the children they hadn’t seen in weeks, for the loved ones they had been torn away from.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, they asked if they could pray for me. I was new here, and they wanted to welcome me. They formed a circle around me, took my hands and prayed. I had never felt so much love, energy and compassion from a group of strangers in my life. Everyone was crying.\n\nAt 3am the next day, I was woken up in my cell.\n\n“Pack your bag. You’re leaving.”\n\nI jolted upright. “I get to go home?”\n\nThe officer shrugged. “I don’t know where you’re going.”\n\nOf course. No one ever knew anything.\n\nI grabbed my things and went downstairs, where 10 other women stood in silence, tears streaming down their faces. But these weren’t happy tears. That was the moment I learned the term “transferred”.\n\nFor many of these women, detention centers had become a twisted version of home. They had formed bonds, established routines and found slivers of comfort in the friendships they had built. Now, without warning, they were being torn apart and sent somewhere new. Watching them say goodbye, clinging to each other, was gut-wrenching.\n\nI had no idea what was waiting for me next. In hindsight, that was probably for the best.\n\nOur next stop was Arizona, the San Luis Regional Detention Center. The transfer process lasted 24 hours, a sleepless, grueling ordeal. This time, men were transported with us. Roughly 50 of us were crammed into a prison bus for the next five hours, packed together – women in the front, men in the back. We were bound in chains that wrapped tightly around our waists, with our cuffed hands secured to our bodies and shackles restraining our feet, forcing every movement into a slow, clinking struggle.\n\nWhen we arrived at our next destination, we were forced to go through the entire intake process all over again, with medical exams, fingerprinting – and pregnancy tests; they lined us up in a filthy cell, squatting over a communal toilet, holding Dixie cups of urine while the nurse dropped pregnancy tests in each of our cups. It was disgusting.\n\nWe sat in freezing-cold jail cells for hours, waiting for everyone to be processed. Across the room, one of the women suddenly spotted her husband. They had both been detained and were now seeing each other for the first time in weeks.\n\nThe look on her face – pure love, relief and longing – was something I’ll never forget.\n\nWe were beyond exhausted. I felt like I was hallucinating.\n\nThe guard tossed us each a blanket: “Find a bed.”\n\nThere were no pillows. The room was ice cold, and one blanket wasn’t enough. Around me, women lay curled into themselves, heads covered, looking like a room full of corpses. This place made the last jail feel like the Four Seasons.\n\nI kept telling myself: Do not let this break you.\n\nThirty of us shared one room. We were given one Styrofoam cup for water and one plastic spoon that we had to reuse for every meal. I eventually had to start trying to eat and, sure enough, I got sick. None of the uniforms fit, and everyone had men’s shoes on. The towels they gave us to shower were hand towels. They wouldn’t give us more blankets. The fluorescent lights shined on us 24/7.\n\nEverything felt like it was meant to break you. Nothing was explained to us. I wasn’t given a phone call. We were locked in a room, no daylight, with no idea when we would get out.\n\nI tried to stay calm as every fiber of my being raged towards panic mode. I didn’t know how I would tell Britt where I was. Then, as if sent from God, one of the women showed me a tablet attached to the wall where I could send emails. I only remembered my CEO’s email from memory. I typed out a message, praying he would see it.\n\nHe responded.\n\nThrough him, I was able to connect with Britt. She told me that they were working around the clock trying to get me out. But no one had any answers; the system made it next to impossible. I told her about the conditions in this new place, and that was when we decided to go to the media.\n\nShe started working with a reporter and asked whether I would be able to call her so she could loop him in. The international phone account that Britt had previously tried to set up for me wasn’t working, so one of the other women offered to let me use her phone account to make the call.\n\nWe were all in this together.\n\nWith nothing to do in my cell but talk, I made new friends – women who had risked everything for the chance at a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nThrough them, I learned the harsh reality of seeking asylum. Showing me their physical scars, they explained how they had paid smugglers anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000 to reach the US border, enduring brutal jungles and horrendous conditions.\n\nOne woman had been offered asylum in Mexico within two weeks but had been encouraged to keep going to the US. Now, she was stuck, living in a nightmare, separated from her young children for months. She sobbed, telling me how she felt like the worst mother in the world.\n\nMany of these women were highly educated and spoke multiple languages. Yet, they had been advised to pretend they didn’t speak English because it would supposedly increase their chances of asylum.\n\nSome believed they were being used as examples, as warnings to others not to try to come.\n\nWomen were starting to panic in this new facility, and knowing I was most likely the first person to get out, they wrote letters and messages for me to send to their families.\n\nSome of the letters given to Jasmine Mooney from the women she met during her time in Ice detention facilities. Photograph: Jasmine Mooney\n\nIt felt like we had all been kidnapped, thrown into some sort of sick psychological experiment meant to strip us of every ounce of strength and dignity.\n\nWe were from different countries, spoke different languages and practiced different religions. Yet, in this place, none of that mattered. Everyone took care of each other. Everyone shared food. Everyone held each other when someone broke down. Everyone fought to keep each other’s hope alive.\n\nI got a message from Britt. My story had started to blow up in the media.\n\nAlmost immediately after, I was told I was being released.\n\nMy Ice agent, who had never spoken to me, told my lawyer I could have left sooner if I had signed a withdrawal form, and that they hadn’t known I would pay for my own flight home.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, I begged every officer I saw to let me pay for my own ticket home. Not a single one of them ever spoke to me about my case.\n\nTo put things into perspective: I had a Canadian passport, lawyers, resources, media attention, friends, family and even politicians advocating for me. Yet, I was still detained for nearly two weeks.\n\nImagine what this system is like for every other person in there.\n\nA small group of us were transferred back to San Diego at 2am – one last road trip, once again shackled in chains. I was then taken to the airport, where two officers were waiting for me. The media was there, so the officers snuck me in through a side door, trying to avoid anyone seeing me in restraints. I was beyond grateful that, at the very least, I didn’t have to walk through the airport in chains.\n\nTo my surprise, the officers escorting me were incredibly kind, and even funny. It was the first time I had laughed in weeks.\n\nI asked if I could put my shoelaces back on.\n\n“Yes,” one of them said with a grin. “But you better not run.”\n\n“Yeah,” the other added. “Or we’ll have to tackle you in the airport. That’ll really make the headlines.”\n\nI laughed, then told them I had spent a lot of time observing the guards during my detention and I couldn’t believe how often I saw humans treating other humans with such disregard. “But don’t worry,” I joked. “You two get five stars.”\n\nWhen I finally landed in Canada, my mom and two best friends were waiting for me. So was the media. I spoke to them briefly, numb and delusional from exhaustion.\n\nIt was surreal listening to my friends recount everything they had done to get me out: working with lawyers, reaching out to the media, making endless calls to detention centers, desperately trying to get through to Ice or anyone who could help. They said the entire system felt rigged, designed to make it nearly impossible for anyone to get out.\n\nThe reality became clear: Ice detention isn’t just a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s a business. These facilities are privately owned and run for profit.\n\nCompanies like CoreCivic and GEO Group receive government funding based on the number of people they detain, which is why they lobby for stricter immigration policies. It’s a lucrative business: CoreCivic made over $560m from Ice contracts in a single year. In 2024, GEO Group made more than $763m from Ice contracts.\n\nThe more detainees, the more money they make. It stands to reason that these companies have no incentive to release people quickly. What I had experienced was finally starting to make sense.\n\nThis is not just my story. It is the story of thousands and thousands of people still trapped in a system that profits from their suffering. I am writing in the hope that someone out there – someone with the power to change any of this – can help do something.\n\nThe strength I witnessed in those women, the love they gave despite their suffering, is what gives me faith. Faith that no matter how flawed the system, how cruel the circumstances, humanity will always shine through.\n\nEven in the darkest places, within the most broken systems, humanity persists. Sometimes, it reveals itself in the smallest, most unexpected acts of kindness: a shared meal, a whispered prayer, a hand reaching out in the dark. We are defined by the love we extend, the courage we summon and the truths we are willing to tell.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "One in five Americans plan to turn their backs for good on companies that have shifted their policies to align with Donald Trump’s agenda, according to a new poll for the Guardian.\n\nAs high-profile brands including Amazon, Target and Tesla grapple with economic boycotts, research by the Harris Poll indicated the backlash could have a lasting impact.\n\n“Companies and consumers are playing a high-stakes game of chicken – corporations betting on convenience winning out over conviction, while consumers wield their spending power like a weapon,” said Libby Rodney, chief strategy officer at the Harris Poll.\n\n“The data suggests this is a miscalculation,” she said. “When 20% of Americans are permanently changing their consumption habits and nearly a third of boycotters say they’ll hold out indefinitely, convenience may no longer be the decisive factor companies think it is.”\n\nWhen asked about the boycotts that have been making headlines over the last few weeks, 36% of Americans said they are or will be participating.\n\nThe strength of feeling varied significantly among people of different generations, races and political views:\n\n53% of gen Zers and 46% of millennials said they are participating in boycotts, compared with 30% of gen Xers and just 22% of Boomers.\n\nOver half of Black (53%) and Hispanic (51%) Americans are boycotting, compared with 29% of white Americans.\n\nDemocrats (49%) are far more likely to be boycotting now than independents (32%) and conservatives (29%).\n\nWhen given a list of reasons why they are boycotting, Americans said the top reason was they want to show companies that consumers have economic power and influence (53%) and express their dissatisfaction with current government policies (49%).\n\nNearly half of those boycotting (46%) also pointed to companies rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies as a reason behind their boycott.\n\nIt’s difficult to track the tangible impacts boycotts have on companies and exactly how many people participate in them. Many start on social media, but other consumers have said they made the decision to move away from companies on their own.\n\nSome groups have coordinated boycotts within their communities in recent weeks, particularly in response to companies like Target, Amazon and Walmart rolling back DEI measures. Target, for example, ended hiring goals for marginalized groups, while Walmart said it will no longer prioritize finding suppliers that are women- or minority-owned companies.\n\nSome Americans feel companies are giving up core moral values in bowing to the president.\n\nThe Rev Jamal Bryant, a pastor based in Baltimore with a large social media following, called on his followers to give up spending money at Target for Lent, which started on 5 March and lasts until 17 April.\n\n“These rollbacks represent more than just corporate decisions; they reflect a deeper erosion of the moral and ethical commitment necessary to build a just society,” Bryant wrote on the website he made for the boycott, targetfast.org. “This Lent, we will begin a corporate fast, starting with Target, as a spiritual act of resistance.”\n\nHispanic activists have similarly called on their community to boycott companies, calling it the Latino Freeze Movement. The movement calls for a boycott on companies that have scaled back their DEI initiatives, and asks for participants to not spend money on non-essentials “until they show us that they care about our minority and immigrant populations”.\n\nLast month, a Harris poll found that 31% of Americans have reported similar goals to “opt out” of the economy this year in light of the changing political climate.\n\nThe companies have said that they are responding to a changing legal environment around DEI. DEI has been a flashpoint in the culture wars for years, with conservatives arguing that it unfairly discriminates against groups that have historically been in the majority, like white Americans.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump vowed to abolish DEI, and he signed multiple executive orders ending DEI programs within the federal government as soon as he came into office. The impact that the administration can have on efforts in the private sector is still unclear, but some companies appear willing to risk losing customers instead of taking their chances.",

        "content": "In the winter of 2021 I was still adjusting to life back in Melbourne after a long stint overseas, cut short by Covid. I was having a crack at online dating when Alex’s playful profile caught my eye.\n\nWe matched, I slid into his DMs to comment on the lemons he had strategically placed next to his butt in his picture, and we were off and running. We clicked easily over text, and messaged often. But lockdowns kept postponing our dates. I think we both knew sparks would fly IRL, so we wanted to make sure it was a good one.\n\nWe eventually went for our first drink at a bar in Brunswick and it went beautifully. All the lighthearted banter from our online chats translated even better in person.\n\nI felt as if I’d won the lottery and while we went home together that night and kept chatting, there were a lot of disclaimers. We were both very busy talking about how we had just come out of relationships and how intense our schedules were.\n\nHe was studying psychology and I was studying social work. Both being in the “feelings” field we were really upfront and honest with each other, trying our best to be very rational and set boundaries.\n\nWe’d hang out every few weeks, spend a few days in bed, laugh heaps and be silly together before retreating from each other lest things get out of control.\n\nA few months in, an old flame of mine sparked again. I knew I was a lot more interested in Alex, but we’d set these guidelines about not taking things further so I went around to his place to let him know the score, that I was keeping my options open.\n\nI took a bouquet of freesias and some earring-backs (Alex was always losing the backs to his earrings) to soften the blow. But when I started explaining, it looked like I had physically hit him. He sort of went into this slow-motion body recoil at the words coming out of my mouth.\n\nWe both knew there were big feelings between us, and he made it clear that he wanted to give us a real shot.\n\nI didn’t need any more convincing, but we still took things pretty slowly. I mean, it wasn’t like we were casually passing wind in each other’s company or anything …\n\nThen one day in his kitchen Alex did a star jump and simultaneously let one rip. It was totally ridiculous and hilarious and kicked off a “farts as performance art” routine which, while oddly endearing, I was definitely not ready to join.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Saved for Later Free newsletter Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s so comfortable with himself that it’s completely contagious. He brings so much natural confidence and levity to any situation, it’s hard not to be inspired. Even when it comes to flatulence.\n\nBy the time summer came around we’d eased into life as a couple. One day at his share house, we climbed up into his attic to retrieve a fan. On the way down Alex went before me, in case he needed to perform some feat of chivalry if I lost my balance. He had his arms outstretched shepherding me when all of a sudden I felt this enormous pressure in my tummy.\n\nI had been saving this first fart in his presence – after all, he’d made all of his so entertaining, I couldn’t just fart directly into his face on a dodgy ladder descent! Soon I was in agony trying to hold it in and as I scrambled to the bottom I rushed to get out of earshot as quickly as possible.\n\nHe quickly registered what was going on and without hesitation he swooped me up in his arms and started to shake me as he shouted dramatically “How dare you deprive me?!”\n\nI started killing myself laughing and begging for mercy – I was still desperate to let this gas escape in privacy. But Alex wouldn’t let up, determined to shake both the fart and the self-consciousness out of me.\n\nI can only assume gravity took its course, but to be honest I can’t remember. Whatever was emitted was drowned out by my tears and laughter.\n\nSomething I’ve always loved about Alex is that his mental framework is built around the idea that life is tough but it’s also pretty silly – why not clap twice and fart the third time? You gotta get the lols where you can, you know?\n\nBut even more than that, as we laughed and he tried to squeeze this fart out of me, it wasn’t just about being funny. He’s such a supportive, compassionate person that he really didn’t want me to suffer – like “why be in pain when you could let it out, I don’t care” – he always wants to ease any tension; to make things comfortable and fun.\n\nFour years later, we’re both still pretty gassy, but Alex is definitely a bigger stinker than me. His farts-as-theatre continue to amuse.\n\n* Names have been changed due to the nature of Tessa and Alex’s professions\n\nTell us the moment you knew",

        "content": "Before Italy, I was only vaguely aware of that ancient stereotype that all women secretly hate one another, that we are incapable of true friendship. Some call it “venimism”; others refer to “mean girls”. In 1893, the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso wrote: “Due to women’s latent antipathy for one another, trivial events give rise to fierce hatreds; and due to women’s irascibility, these occasions lead quickly to insolence and assaults.” The source of our latent antipathy? Sexual jealousy, of course. We hate one another because we are ever competing for male attention.\n\nI always thought this misogynistic myth was obviously false. I had lots of girlfriends, from school and soccer; so did my sisters, my mom, pretty much every girl I knew. But, then again, I also thought my innocence was obvious … And, clearly, the stereotype found its way into my courtroom, where a cross hung on the wall and my devoutly Catholic prosecutor accused me not merely of being a murderer, but of being a dirty, drug-addled, woman-hating slut.\n\n“Meredith was astonished that Amanda had started a relationship with a boy after just arriving in Perugia … that Amanda owned condoms and a vibrator,” explained Dr Giuliano Mignini. “It is possible that Meredith argued with Amanda … because of her habit of bringing strange men into the house … [So,] under the influence of drugs and probably also alcohol, Amanda decided to involve Meredith in a violent sex game … For Amanda, the time had come to take revenge on that ‘simpering goody two-shoes’ – so she must have thought.”\n\nWith these words, which echoed through the global media, Mignini inducted me into a not-so-secret society of women. You know who I’m talking about. The women who’ve been the subject of TMZ headlines, Saturday Night Live skits and David Letterman’s top 10 lists. The women who’ve been turned into Halloween costumes and found themselves referenced in rap lyrics. The women we treat like punching bags and punchlines. The women whose broken bodies, broken relationships, most vulnerable moments and worst experiences we consume like candy. I call us the Sisterhood of Ill Repute. I didn’t even realise I belonged to this club until I met another member: Monica Lewinsky.\n\nIt was shortly before my first-ever speaking event in January 2017, at a private conference in Seattle. Monica was one of the other speakers. I had an hour to fill, and I was terrified. After crafting and polishing my talk, I’d rehearsed a half dozen times leading up to the event. I knew that to really tell my story, I would have to break my own heart in front of the audience, so I went to the places that still hurt. But saying those words in my living room was nothing like standing in front of a crowd of hundreds who might believe all sorts of falsehoods about me.\n\nBefore the event, Monica invited me up to her hotel room to chat. She had gone through the gauntlet of public shaming in the worst possible way when I was just a kid. I remember eating dinner with my family and listening to them discuss the news. It was the first time I’d heard the term “oral sex”, and when I spoke up to say that I couldn’t understand why everyone was so upset about people saying sexy things over the phone, my entire family keeled over with laughter. In the years after that, I, too, casually absorbed the image of Monica presented by the tabloids. I didn’t dig into the story, I didn’t educate myself, and if you’d asked me about it in high school, I probably would have said, “Oh yeah, Monica. The blowjob lady.”\n\nBut, after getting the tabloid treatment myself, I humbly withdrew the conviction that I could ever trust the image presented to me by the media of who any person really is. And when Monica gave her Ted Talk, The Price of Shame, she opened my eyes not only to who the real Monica was, but who she had always been. I’d followed her closely since then, reading all her writing for Vanity Fair, feeling utterly validated when she described her experiences of being ruthlessly shamed in the press, humiliated and demonised for the sake of other people’s entertainment and political gain.\n\nI expected to be starstruck when I walked into that hotel room. Instead, what I found, almost immediately, was a big sister.\n\nView image in fullscreen Knox with Lorena Gallo, formerly Bobbitt, in 2019. Photograph: Courtesy of Amanda Knox\n\nFrom the first moment, she was warm and kind. She made me a cup of tea. We sat by the windows, overlooking downtown Seattle, and talked about my speech. She gave me some invaluable pointers about mental preparation and self-care, but most of all we talked about processing trauma. How you’re never really done with it, and how talking about it publicly is both triggering and healing. She gave me the rundown of which kinds of therapy had worked for her, which hadn’t, and why. (I have yet to meet anyone more committed to therapy.) But perhaps what struck me the most was what wasn’t said. You’re that girl from Italy! What was prison like? What’s it like to be famous? All those conversational notes, ranging from cringey to offensive, that popped up whenever I met a stranger who thought they knew who I was because they’d absorbed a decade of media coverage, were absent. And it wasn’t because Monica had been unaware of all that. She’d read about “Foxy Knoxy” just like millions of others, but it was Amanda she’d invited for a cup of tea.\n\nLike Monica, Lorena Bobbitt had been ducking her head for 20 years in the face of reputational damage that could never be undone\n\nI walked away from that meeting feeling truly seen. Here was someone to whom I didn’t have to explain the trauma of prolonged, widespread public shaming. I had been grappling with my status as a public figure since I came home – the invasion of my privacy, my impotence to fight slanderous statements in the press – and seeing her surviving it, and thriving even, gave me hope that I could as well. A strong sense of empathy can form a bond between people with vastly different life experiences, but it’s a lot easier to make such connections when the other person has been in your shoes. That’s why support groups exist, and it’s why I left that meeting inspired to connect with other publicly shamed women.\n\nWhen I was producing a podcast called The Truth About True Crime, I did a live episode with Lorena Bobbitt (now Gallo) at a true-crime convention in Washington DC. Like Monica, Lorena had been ducking her head for 20 years in the face of reputational damage that could never be undone. But she agreed to meet me on a stage and talk in front of a live audience about how we have lived our lives in the crosshairs of public shaming. Most people remember that John Wayne Bobbitt’s penis was cut off, but they forget that Lorena claimed she was a victim of domestic violence and marital rape, and that her own violent act was done in a moment of mental instability. That doesn’t excuse her actions, but it is crucial context that is often left out.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I got there early, and I was in the green room waiting for Lorena to arrive, when a comedian from New Jersey came in. He had just finished his on-air segment, and we chatted briefly. When he asked what I was going to be talking about, I told him I was interviewing Lorena, and he said: “What about? Which knives are best for slicing sausage?”\n\n“No,” I said. “Actually, we’ll be talking about how people still reduce her to a penis-chopping joke when she is, in fact, a complex human being who advocates in support of victims of domestic violence.”\n\nTo his credit, the comedian replied: “Oh, I get it. She’s not the monster. I am!”\n\nBut as much as we are all responsible for the media we consume, I don’t want to demonise the audience, the millions of us who casually absorbed skewed and incomplete stories about Lorena, about Monica, about me. Such stories are designed to appeal to our worst impulses. Judgment will always come more easily to us than mercy, understanding, forgiveness, and a nuanced acknowledgment of the complexity that underlies nearly all serious harms. It feels good to hate “bad” people, and there’s a special kind of hate reserved for “bad women”. The narrative of the “mean girl”, the “homewrecker” and “girl-on-girl” crime is titillating precisely because it confirms the stereotype that women are secretly one another’s worst enemies. Amanda v Meredith. It distracts from the actual crimes committed against women by men, and even validates them, giving tacit permission for men to hate women, too.",

        "content": "After the October hearing, the families joined Pierson and Jacobsen at a Mexican restaurant. A boom mic from a documentary crew hovered above Pierson’s head. Jacobsen pulled out a suitcase from under the table, and Pierson handed out glass awards, from their foundation, honoring the families’ leadership on aviation safety. Pierson improvised a speech for each one.\n\nChris Moore thought, well, this was unexpected. “You don’t think, oh, I can’t wait to get an award someday.” But at this point in the awful five-year battle that he never wanted, “shaking my fist at the clouds,” as he put it, a token for the Zoom group’s efforts felt nice. Moore knows that all this fact-finding and accountability-seeking serves another purpose, too: to help protect him from his bottomless grief.\n\nPierson still wrestles with his own grief, a wholly different kind. Could he have done more to prevent the crashes? “I don’t think I’ll ever—” He lets out a long exhale. “I’ll ever stop feeling that way.”\n\nListening, I thought about something Doug Pasternak, the lead investigator of the Max report, told me about his conversations with Pierson. “He was devastated. He did have a sense of, ‘guilt’ may not be the word, but responsibility. He just wishes there was something that could have been done to prevent these horrific accidents.”\n\nPierson couldn’t prevent the crashes, although no one I spoke to thought he could have done more. But he could become the guy hellbent on not letting another Max fall from the sky. He could hunch over every report to work out possible explanations in an RV kitchenette. He could be the fired-up guy pushing authorities to look—no really, look—under every last Boeing rock. If a corporate and regulatory culture of yes-men and -women led to the deaths of 346 people, then Pierson will happily be the nope man, awarding no benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe new documents, with all their promise of bringing home Pierson’s contested electrical theory, ended up amounting to less than he’d hoped. The NTSB told Pierson it wouldn’t hand the papers to the Max crash investigators—the cases had concluded, the board said—but he could do so himself.\n\nBoeing wobbles in limbo, before civil and criminal courts, at the FAA, in Congress, awaiting the final door-plug report from the NTSB. Observers say 2025 will be Boeing’s pivotal year: The company either turns around under its new CEO or succumbs to a doom loop. Pierson vows to keep talking.\n\n“For me, it was always about not allowing them to shut me up,” he says. Recently, the foundation received its first donations and now has a payroll. They’re starting to monitor other aircraft models and are talking with a university about analyzing industry-wide data—“to be an equal-opportunity pain in the butt,” Pierson says. The guy Boeing surely hoped would go away by now has, instead, institutionalized himself to stick around.\n\nWhen Pierson said goodbye to me in DC, his parting words were: “Don’t fly the Max.” I couldn’t bring myself to tell him. That’s exactly what I was booked on, the 7:41 pm from Dulles to San Francisco. It was the one I could catch after the whistleblower event on Capitol Hill and still walk into my house that night. Commercial flight was supposed to be about convenience, after all, collapsing a country’s span into a Tuesday night commute. At this point in aviation history, we passengers should be able to pick a flight on time alone.\n\nHurtling through the air that evening in seat 10C, I read the US House committee’s Max investigation, a disruptor of illusions. Like many fliers, I’d long ago made my bargain with risk. I’d taken comfort in statistics, summoned faith in the engineers and assembly workers, the pilots, the system. I’d shunted away the knowledge—paralyzing, if you let it in—that stepping on an airplane is an extraordinary act of trust. Deep in the report, I reached the part about a senior manager at Boeing’s factory in Renton, a guy named Ed Pierson, who seemingly knew what we all know when we soothe ourselves by thinking, They wouldn’t let it fly if it weren’t safe. We’re all relying on someone to be the “they.”\n\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "According to a memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document, on which Politico first reported, states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will “leverage blockchain technology” as part of its procurement process.\n\n“All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” the memo reads. “This approach would encourage innovation and efficiency among implementing partners and allow for more flexible and responsive programming focused on tangible impact rather than simply completing activities and inputs.”\n\nThe memo does not make clear what specifically this means—if it would encompass doing cash transfers in some kind of cryptocurrency or stablecoin, for example, or simply mean using a blockchain ledger to track aid disbursement.\n\nThe memo comes as staffers at USAID are trying to understand their future. The agency was an early target of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has effectively been headed by centibillionaire Elon Musk. Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration, the State Department put the entire agency’s staff on administrative leave, slashed its workforce, and halted a portion of payments to partner organizations around the world, including those doing lifesaving work. Since then a federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the dismantling of the agency, but the memo appears to indicate that the administration has plans to continue its mission of drastically cutting USAID and fully folding it into the State Department.\n\nThe plans for the blockchain have also caught staffers off guard.\n\nFew blockchain-based projects have managed to achieve large-scale use in the humanitarian sector. Linda Raftree, a consultant who helps humanitarian organizations adopt new technology, says there’s a reason for that—the incorporation of blockchain technology is often unnecessary.\n\n“It feels like a fake technological solution for a problem that doesn’t exist,” she says. “I don’t think we were ever able to find an instance where people were using blockchain where they couldn’t use existing tools.”\n\nGiulio Coppi, a senior humanitarian officer at the nonprofit Access Now who has researched the use of blockchain in humanitarian work, says that blockchain technologies, while sometimes effective, offer no obvious advantages over other tools organizations could use, such as an existing payments system or another database tool. “There’s no proven advantage that it’s cheaper or better,” he says. “The way it’s been presented is this tech solutionist approach that has been proven over and over again to not have any substantial impact in reality.”\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82.\n\nThere have been, however, some successful instances of using blockchain technology in the humanitarian sector. In 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) ran a small pilot to give cash assistance to Ukrainians displaced by the Russia-Ukraine war in a stablecoin. Other pilots have been tested in Kenya by the Kenya Red Cross Society. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which works with the Kenya team, also helped to develop the Humanitarian Token Solution (HTS).",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Law enforcement requests for user data from Apple, Google, and Meta mean that these companies can decide whether government authorities have access to your personal information, including location data. This means the companies with the most insight into our lives, movements, and communications are frontline arbiters of our constitutional rights and the rights of non-US citizens—a fact some are likely feeling more acutely now than ever.\n\nCollaboration between Big Tech and the Trump administration began before Donald Trump’s swearing-in on January 20. Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Uber each gave $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. Separately, in personal donations, so did Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Tim Cook.\n\nAmericans concerned about the Trump administration and Silicon Valley’s embrace of it, may consider becoming a “digital expat”—moving your digital life off of US-based systems. Meanwhile, Europeans are starting to see US data services as “no longer safe” for businesses, governments, and societies.\n\nHere’s a brief rundown of the privacy, security, and civil liberties issues related to the use of US-based digital services that suddenly feel more urgent—and what to do about it.\n\nCozying Up\n\nIn anticipation of Trump’s inauguration, Meta-owned Facebook, Instagram, and Threads made drastic policy changes citing alignment with Trump administration values, to permit hate speech and abuse “on topics like immigration and gender.” Meta also signaled its allegiance by ditching its fact-checkers—a frequent target of MAGA world ire. Two days after the inauguration, Meta quietly rolled out pro-life moderation actions through post suppression and account suspensions. Zuckerberg explained the company’s new direction to staff, saying: “We now have an opportunity to have a productive partnership with the United States government.”\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to our request for comment regarding its partnership, data sharing, or policy changes.\n\nGoogle followed suit. The company changed its Maps and Search results to rename part of the world—the Gulf of Mexico—following a Trump executive order renaming it the Gulf of America, despite the the US claiming control of less than 50 percent of the Gulf. Apple and Microsoft also followed Trump’s order.\n\nGoogle’s consumer products also received a swath of updates in line with the new administration, including further changes to Maps, Calendar, and Search. Next, Google removed the new administration’s “banned” terms from its Google Health product. Then it did an about-face on its public promise not to build weaponized AI tools, such as Project Dragonfly, which was discovered in 2018 to be tailoring Google’s entire platform to enable China’s aggressive crackdown on its citizens. When reached for comment, Google did not immediately respond.\n\nBig Tech aligning with the Trump administration matters because its business models rely on surveillance and amassing our personal data. Meta, Google, Apple and other large tech firms are among the gatekeepers standing between privacy and government requests for user data. Even when tech firms must comply by law, they’re often still free to decide how much information they collect about people and how long they store the data.\n\nGovernment Hand-Outs\n\nCurrent US laws around tech, privacy, and government requests have been guided by bulwarks like the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, US court rulings, and tech companies’ willingness to question the federal government’s opinion that it is entitled to access our personal information and location data. Apple, Google, and Meta each have language about law enforcement data requests that make it seem like they have our backs when it comes to overreach. Now, with companies shaping certain policies, tools, and practices in pursuit of “partnership” with the Trump administration, these companies’ powers over our data takes on new focus.\n\nGenerally, law enforcement can compel US companies to hand over user data using a subpoena, court order, search warrant—or, in rarer cases, a National Security Letter (NSL). As Google explains, an NSL is “one of the authorities granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).” Google adds, “FISA orders and authorizations can be used to compel electronic surveillance and the disclosure of stored data, including content from services like Gmail, Drive, and Photos.” How companies respond to these demands can vary in consequential ways.",

        "title": "Yahoo Is Still Here—and It Has Big Plans for AI",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "In September 2021, Jim Lanzone took over a company whose name once embodied the go-go spirit of the internet but had, over the years, become a joke: Yahoo. He accepted the CEO post from the new private-equity owner Apollo Global Management, which had bought the property from Verizon, the most recent and possibly most clueless caretaker (high bar alert) in a long series of management shifts. Visiting him at the company’s offices in New York City, I ask him why he took the job. “I love turnarounds,” he says.\n\nThis is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.\n\nLanzone’s résumé confirms that. In 2001 he took over a sagging search property called AskJeeves—its share price was less than a dollar, down from a high of $196—and built it back to the point where Barry Diller’s IAC Corp bought it for $1.85 billion. At CBS Interactive and then CBS’s chief digital office during the 2010s, he yanked the stuffy Tiffany network into the streaming age. Yahoo, celebrating its 30th anniversary this month, might be his biggest challenge yet. Its history is pocked with missed opportunities, which explains in part why a public company once worth well over $100 billion was sold to a private equity firm for $5 billion in 2021. Yahoo famously passed on buying Google, and actually got Mark Zuckerberg to tentatively agree to sell Facebook for $1 billion before then CEO Terry Semel asked to renegotiate, which squelched the deal. Talent that walked out Yahoo’s door included the founders of WhatsApp. Promising acquisitions like Flickr, Tumblr and Huffington Post were ditched at fire-sale prices. In recent years Yahoo was a low-priority property for its owner, Verizon. Instead of trying to revive its purple glory, it merged Yahoo's assets with those of another failed icon, AOL, and dubbed the new brand Oath.\n\nSome pegged Lanzone’s chances at zero. “It’s hard to believe anyone else on the planet wants any part of his role, “ wrote George Bradt, one of those MBA types who churn out content for Forbes. Lanzone saw something different. In his view, Yahoo was an unacknowledged gem. “If you were able to take the name Yahoo off of it and look at the business in 2021, you saw billions in revenue,” he says.\n\nLanzone has little patience for exhuming past blunders. “I think the story of Yahoo's missed opportunities is tired,” he says. “It's boring.” Instead of crying over lost search glory, Lanzone concentrated on improving what Yahoo did. “We didn’t have to worry about what we weren’t,” he says. He got rid of money-losing units, like some nonperforming ad tech divisions, and quietly made some acquisitions to bolster the best properties, like Wagr, a sports betting app, to bring Yahoo Sports into the gambling age. He also brought in capable executives like former ESPN digital head Ryan Spoon, who now heads Yahoo Sports. He’s boosted profits and grown the company’s audience to the point where he says that Yahoo has performed the quickest return of any Apollo acquisition. Since Yahoo is private, the actual financials aren’t available. But Yahoo’s comms team provided me with a lengthy document packed with data to bolster Lanzone’s claim that Yahoo still has something to yodel about. Comscore, a marketing company that measures traffic, ranks Yahoo No. 1 in news, No. 1 in finance, and No. 3 in sports. It’s second only to Gmail in mail. He tells me that in the US alone, “hundreds of millions” of people use Yahoo every month.\n\nA year after Lanzone took the job, the entire tech world was turned around by the appearance of ChatGPT. In previous transformations like search, social, and mobile, Yahoo has a near-perfect record of botching these moments. Lanzone says Yahoo won’t be creating its own language models or dropping $100 billion on data centers, but he believes the company will seize the moment nonetheless. “I’d like to automate the word ‘AI’ so I don’t have to say it so much,” he says. Yahoo has in-house machine-learning talent and draws on outside companies for AI technology. For instance, it partners with the startup Sierra for robot customer service agents.\n\nOne of Lanzone’s canniest AI moves was acquiring Artifact, the AI-powered news aggregator created by Instagram cofounders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. When the pair decided it would not become a viable business, they announced its closure and Lanzone was among multiple suitors vying for the underlying technology. It became the centerpiece of the homepage that Yahoo relaunched earlier this year. “Instead of incorporating their technology into our product, we did it the other way,” Lanzone says. “Essentially Yahoo News is now Artifact.” Systrom approves. “We partnered with Yahoo because they made a strong offer, but also because they planned on deploying our hard work to many millions of people,” he says.",

        "content": "On Verizon? If you own a Google Pixel 9 or Samsung Galaxy S25 series phone and find yourself in a cellular dead zone, you can now send texts to your friends and family via satellite. This is the same functionality Apple introduced for the iPhone 14 and newer (regardless of carrier) in iOS 18.\n\nWhile these Android phones have been able to connect to emergency services via satellite, they can now use satellite connectivity to send texts to anyone, regardless of the recipient's device or carrier. Verizon says this capability has already started to roll out but will take two weeks to complete.\n\nVerizon isn't the only carrier focused on providing this kind of satellite connectivity to fill in the gaps in terrestrial cellular network coverage. T-Mobile recently announced a partnership with Starlink that's currently in beta until July. It lets you send and receive texts, and the carrier says you'll soon be able to share photos, use data, make voice calls, and more. T-Mobile's solution will be included for subscribers on its Go5G Next plan, and other customers can add it to their existing plan for $15 per month. AT&T is also working with AST SpaceMobile and recently tested a video call over satellite connectivity.\n\nThis Handheld Console Lets You Relive Your Nintendo DS Dreams\n\nCourtesy of OneXSugar\n\nYou’ve seen the Steam Deck, you’ve seen the Switch, and you no doubt remember the Nintendo DS. But this newly announced gaming handheld, the OneXSugar, claims to do that all in one. The device has two screens and rotating gamepad controllers to allow it to transform into all sorts of clever modes of use. There’s the standard landscape mode, using the primary 6-inch screen and the two sides of the controller. But flip up that screen and you’ll get access to the 3.92-inch secondary square screen. That secondary screen can be used as a kickstand, or you can rotate the controllers to attach to the square screen. Now that’s definitely unlike anything we’ve seen before.\n\nThe Android-based device, announced on Indiegogo, was unveiled alongside a new series of chips from Qualcomm designed specifically for gaming handhelds. The Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 boasts 28 percent improved graphics with ray tracing, specifically designed for cloud-based gaming and retro emulators. Just don’t expect it to support Windows-level games like AMD’s Ryzen Z-series chips, which you can find in handhelds like the popular Asus ROG Ally X.\n\nThe company behind the OneXSugar also has something more powerful in its lineup, the OneXPlayer G1, which is part laptop, part gaming handheld. No word on the price or release date yet, but hopefully we’ll hear more details about the OneXSugar soon. —Luke Larsen\n\nVelotric's Breeze 1 Is a Commuting, Crusing Ebike\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nAfter multiple rounds of layoffs and pulling out of the European market, Rad Power Bikes’ new CEO recently stepped down. That leaves a big, Rad-sized hole in the direct-to-consumer electric bike space—a space the company created when Mike Radenbaugh founded Rad in 2007.\n\nWhich company will fill in the gap? We’re most excited to test one of the new bikes from the up-and-coming Velotric. The Breeze 1 launched on March 18. It's a commuter bike built like a cruiser, with a comfortable, upright seating position on a step-through frame and a powerful 750-watt motor with a 70-mile range.\n\nThe bike also has a few cool tricks up its sleeve. For example, you can switch between using a torque sensor, which will adjust the pressure you need to pedal on mixed terrain, versus the more old-fashioned cadence sensor, which is best for longer stretches of roads. It’s also integrated with Apple Find My and Apple Health, so if you’re an iPhone user, you don’t have to fiddle with your fitness tracker to log a bike ride. Most importantly, it weighs under 50 pounds and costs under $2,000. I’m unboxing my tester ride (in Violet Haze, naturally) as we speak. —Adrienne So\n\nFujifilm Debuts a Medium Format Compact Camera\n\nAnyone who’s ever dreamed of a medium format Fujifilm X100 camera, dream no more. The new GFX100RF is just that. It takes the same minimalist, rangefinder styling of the X100 series, with dial controls and a nice wide-angle prime lens on the front, but adds a 102-megapixel medium format sensor.\n\nThere is a price to be paid for that much larger sensor though—the GFX100RF is larger and heavier than any of the X100 cameras. At 5.26 by 3.56 inches, with a depth of 3 inches, this isn’t fitting in your pocket, nor is the 25.9 ounces (735 grams) light enough to let you throw it in your bag and forget about it. To make the GFX100RF weather-sealed you’ll need to further bulk it up with an adapter ring and filter, just as you do with the X100VI.",

        "content": "I know this is unconventional, but I’m going to start by telling you the ending. Or at least, the ending as it stands today. Most of the people involved in this story wind up either dead, maimed, spending months in a mental hospital, languishing in jail, or gone underground. It's a tragedy from almost any angle, especially because, at the outset, most of these people were idealists committed to doing as much good as possible in a world they saw as beset by existential threats. In spite of those aims, or perhaps in pursuit of them, over the course of this story their lives will devolve into senseless violence. And by the time we reach the present, six people will be killed, two others presumed dead by suicide, and at least two in hiding. Countless friends and family members will find themselves bereft. I feel it's only fair to warn you that, in this story, justice and redemption have so far proven hard to come by.\n\nHow did so much go so wrong? When did it begin to fall apart? Trying to answer these questions—as I’ve done for the past two years—is not unlike querying a chatbot powered by a large language model. The responses you receive depend on the prompts you compose. Ask the question one way, and you might elicit a set of facts adhering to one reality: The emergence of the world’s first AI-inflected death cult, whose obsessions over the prospect of a machine superintelligence eventually sent them spiraling into destruction. Tweak the prompt, and you may produce an entirely different story: of a charismatic, deranged leader spreading a carefully engineered mania to followers seeking purpose in life. Try again, and you could get the tale of a vulnerable minority, driven to act at the extremes of their convictions by a society that rejects them.\n\nBut just like the outputs produced by our current AI oracles, some of these narratives turn out to be rife with hallucinations: plausible-sounding visions of reality, but fabricated to fill the need for a greater meaning. The trouble, as I went along, was separating the truth from the delirium. I wasn't always sure that I could. To be honest, I'm still not. But here we are, and a story has to start somewhere.\n\nI.\n\nLet’s begin on an afternoon in mid-November 2019, under the redwood canopy in Northern California, along a road called Bohemian Highway. It was a Friday, and Sergeant Brian Parks of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office was on patrol along the Russian River near the town of Guerneville when a call came over his radio. Someone had dialed 911 from Westminster Woods, a wilderness camp and retreat center about 8 miles away. The caller reported that a group of several people had driven up and blocked the camp's entrance and exit with their vehicles. They'd gotten out and begun some kind of demonstration, clad in black robes and masks.\n\nSonoma sheriffs occasionally encounter protesters at Bohemian Grove, a secretive men’s club for powerful elites that also meets in the redwoods near Guerneville, but the county was typically “not a hotbed” for that sort of thing, Parks says. So he thought to himself, “You know what, I'm just going to roll that way,” and steered his car toward Westminster Woods.\n\nThe camp was hosting two groups of visitors that day. One was an alumni gathering for a nonprofit called the Center for Applied Rationality. The Bay Area group ran workshops dedicated to “developing clear thinking for the sake of humanity's future,” as they put it. People within and around CFAR, which tended to attract a cohort of young, technically adept seekers, often called themselves simply “the rationalists.” CFAR was itself an outgrowth of another organization, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, devoted to the technical endeavor of creating artificial intelligence that wouldn't destroy the world.\n\nBoth CFAR and MIRI were the brainchildren of Eliezer Yudkowsky, the now famous researcher and AI pessimist who had been warning of AI's dangers for decades. In recent years the two organizations had become intertwined with a third group, the philanthropically minded effective altruists. EA, initially focused on maximizing the value in charitable giving, had increasingly taken on MIRI’s views—namely, that the existential risk, or x-risk, posed by “unfriendly” AI trumped all of humanity’s other problems. In the rationalist world, CFAR provided the grand thinking, MIRI the technical know-how, and EA the funding to save humans from being eradicated by runaway machines.",

        "content": "As the birthplace of prestige TV shows like The Sopranos and The Wire, HBO—and, by extension, Max (aka the streamer formerly known as HBO Max)—is best known for its impressive lineup of original series. The network has also been upping the ante with feature-length content that is the stuff of Oscar dreams.\n\nBelow is a list of some of our favorite films streaming on Max—from Oscar-winning foreign films to dystopian sci-fi classics. If you decide you’re in more of a TV mood, head over to our picks for the best shows on Max.

Divine G (Domingo) is an inmate at New York’s infamous Sing Sing prison, serving time for a crime he did not commit. During his imprisonment, he finds purpose and joy in the prison’s theater group, part of its (very real) Rehabilitation Through the Arts program. By tapping into his inner thespian, Divine G is able to connect with his emotions, and he becomes determined to prove his innocence. But his undeniable acting talent, which inspires some of his fellow inmates, ends up posing a problem when it comes time for a parole hearing. Ultimately, Divine comes to respect the transformative power of the arts in helping him and some of his fellow inmates to overcome their past traumas. Making the film even more powerful is the fact that many of the actors are formerly incarcerated men who took part in the program.\n\nHeretic\n\nHugh Grant earned some much-deserved awards consideration for playing so far against type in this religion-themed psychological thriller. Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East) are two young Mormon missionaries who are desperate to find someone—anyone—who will let them speak about their religion in an attempt to convert new members to the church. When Mr. Reed (Grant), a seemingly kind older man, invites them into his home in order to deliver their spiel to him and his wife, it quickly becomes apparent, at least to Sister Barnes, that something is amiss. And that Reed doesn’t so much want to hear about religion as he does talk about it—and force his own beliefs on the young women in increasingly bizarre, and deadly, ways.\n\nBeau is Afraid\n\nLike writer/director Ari Aster’s previous two films, Hereditary and Midsommar, a written summary never quite seems to do justice to his very specific brand of moviemaking. In Beau Is Afraid, which is undoubtedly the most surreal of all his films, Joaquin Phoenix stars in the title role of Beau, a middle-aged man who lives alone in a crime-ridden neighborhood where even running across the street to the store can be a deadly adventure. When Beau, after a bizarre series of events, learns that his mother has died, he must find a way to forge ahead in the face of his many anxieties in order to travel home and deal with the aftermath. If only he didn’t keep falling prey to people promising to help him, only to draw him into their own surreal circumstances. Though at times it can feel a little self-indulgent—and, at two hours and 59 minutes, overly long—Phoenix’s performance and Aster’s auteurist stamp make it nonetheless compelling.\n\nCarrie\n\nEven if you’ve seen it 100 times and know what’s coming next, Carrie still has the ability to make you jump out of your chair—nearly 50 years after its original release. Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a shy, awkward teen who has been criminally sheltered (and regularly abused) by her God-fearing mother (Piper Laurie). But when the neighborhood kids nicknamed her “Creepy Carrie,” they were on to something. Because when Carrie is stressed, pissed, or otherwise facing some kind of psychological torment, she lashes out—with her kinetic powers. Unfortunately, her classmates only learn about this latent talent when it’s too late: after they’ve properly humiliated her at her high school prom. Though there are sequels and remakes, there’s only one original (and solid) adaptation of Stephen King’s debut novel, and it’s this one.\n\nWe Live in Time\n\nAndrew Garfield and Florence Pugh ignite the screen with their chemistry in this romantic tearjerker that follows the couple over the course of a decade, from their meet-not-so-cute (she hits him with her car) to their journey into parenthood and, eventually, facing the ultimate curveball that threatens their happily-ever-after. Garfield and Pugh are two of the most acclaimed actors of their generation, and We Live in Time proves why.\n\nBlue Velvet\n\nMulholland Drive may be widely considered David Lynch’s masterpiece, but Blue Velvet isn’t too far behind. Like most of Lynch’s projects, a general summary doesn’t really help sell the film: Clean-cut college student Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) returns home to help out at the family hardware store after his father has a stroke … and randomly finds a severed ear on the ground. While the detective assigned to investigate the incident tells Jeffrey not to discuss the crime, the detective’s teenage daughter (Laura Dern) seems to know as much about the crime as her dad does and teams up with Jeffrey to learn more. Their suspicions eventually lead them to Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), a sultry nightclub singer, who seems to have some weird kinks (as Jeffrey sees for himself while hiding in her apartment). As always, Lynch’s movies are better experienced than explained. And Blue Velvet, which earned Lynch a Best Director Oscar nomination, is one of the late auteur’s very best.\n\nSons of Ecstasy\n\nPhoenix, Arizona, may seem like an odd setting for a bitter feud between wannabe kingpins, but that’s exactly where this documentary takes place. It was there, in the 1990s, that two young men—Liverpool-born stockbroker Shaun Attwood and New York mafia royalty Gerard Gravano—found themselves at violent odds as both attempted to become the preferred supplier of ecstasy to local nightclubs and desert raves. For Gravano, son of Sammy “The Bull” Gravano, there’s a legacy to uphold. For Attwood, getting burned out by his day job led to the desire to become something more. Both men sat down with directors Elli Hakami and Julian P. Hobbs to tell their own stories.\n\nJuror #2\n\nUp until now, most of what you’ve heard about Juror #2 is how it’s one of Clint Eastwood’s most accomplished directorial efforts—and yet somehow it got shafted when it came to its theatrical release. Now’s your chance to see what all the fuss is about. Justin Kemp (Nicholas Hoult) is a journalist and recovering alcoholic who is making every effort to maintain his sobriety. That becomes a bit of a challenge when he’s put on the jury of a high-profile murder trial … only to realize that he may have inadvertently played a part in what happened. Hoult is fantastic in this edge-of-your-seat legal (and ethical) drama.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nIt has been nearly 40 years since Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice stormed the late ’80s box office. In the decades since, we’ve often heard rumblings that a sequel was in the works. Or might be in the works. Or most definitely was in the works. Or might not be in the cards at all. Well, in 2024 it finally happened, and it was as if Michael Keaton had never stepped away from the role at all (eternal life has a way of doing that to you). This time, however, Lydia (Winona Ryder) is still doing her best to forget her rendezvous with the bio-exorcism pro. But when she returns to her childhood home, it’s her own badass daughter (Jenna Ortega) who finds a way to bring him back into all their lives.\n\nSuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story\n\nJames Gunn’s new version of Superman won’t arrive in theaters until July. In the meantime, audiences have Gunn and his DC Studios co-CEO Peter Safran (partly) to thank for bringing this long-overdue documentary about the ultimate superhero actor to worldwide audiences. Directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui deliver a heartfelt, moving tribute to Reeve—as an actor, yes, but even more so as a person who never gave up. Alexandra Reeve Givens, Matthew Reeve, and Will Reeve—Reeve’s children—share their own stories about their dad, giving the project yet another layer of intimacy. No, you’re crying.\n\nJoker: Folie À Deux\n\nFive years ago, Joker was a major awards season contender: The film, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix, earned a total of 11 Oscar nominations—and went home with two of them (including one for Phoenix). Joker: Folie À Deux did not follow the same path. The sequel, in which Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck finds love with the equally disturbed Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), fizzled at the box office and was met with pretty scathing reviews. Still: Judge the film for yourself, we say. Even if you agree with the bulk of critics, spending 138 minutes with Phoenix and Gaga playing off of each other at their most unhinged is worth the price of admission (which, in this case, is the Max subscription you already have).\n\nWatchmen: Chapter I\n\nBrandon Vietti (Batman: Under the Red Hood) directs this innovative animated adaption of Alan Moore’s Hugo Award-winning graphic novel about an investigation into the murder of Edward Blake—better known as a superhero named the Comedian. When the police come up empty in terms of suspects, the costumed vigilante Rorschach (Titus Welliver) decides to take the case into his own hands, and eventually comes to believe that someone is attempting to knock off superheroes. So he enlists the help of a group of them in order to put a stop to the killing spree.\n\nMaXXXine\n\nMaXXXine is the third film in writer-director Ti West’s X trilogy, which began with X and Pearl. It’s set immediately after the events of Pearl: Mia Goth’s Maxine Minx is desperate to escape her upbringing as a preacher’s daughter and make the move from porn to more mainstream movies. She gets her chance when she lands the lead in a horror movie, The Puritan II. Then her friends start getting murdered. Ultimately, Maxine is forced to confront the sins of her past and find a way to achieve the fame she so desperately dreams of.\n\nCivil War\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, the United States has transformed into an all-out battlefield between an authoritarian government, headed by a third-term president (Nick Offerman), and a stream of secessionist movements that threaten to destroy the country as we know it. But a group of journalists (led by Kirsten Dunst) is determined to document the downfall of America at any cost, so they set about heading to the White House in order to interview the embattled president. Which is much easier said than done. Oscar nominee Alex Garland (Ex-Machina) writes and directs this dystopian drama that often hits uncomfortably close to home.\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\n\nFuriosa may been dubbed last summer’s first box office “bomb,” but don’t let those dollar-focused headlines deter you from this one. Anya Taylor-Joy, who is undoubtedly one of the most versatile actors working today, shines in the role of Imperator Furiosa, a badass emancipator who dares to challenge gender conventions in a dangerous, postapocalyptic world where (no surprise at all) men make the rules. Taylor-Joy does an admirable job embracing the role that Charlize Theron memorably originated in Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nDrive My Car\n\nDespite earning four Oscar nominations in 2022—and winning one for Best International Feature Film—it still feels entirely accurate to state that Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car remains woefully underseen. Here’s your chance to do your part to fix that. Yusuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi Nishijima) ia a renowned theater director still reeling from the death of his wife. Eventually, he makes the decision to begin working again and agrees to a two-month residency to direct a play in Hiroshima, an hour from his home. So each day, a young woman (Toko Miura) drives him to and from the theater. All that time spent in a confined space together eventually leads to a friendship—one where Kafuku feels comfortable sharing the challenges he is facing with his new project and, eventually, the truth about the way in which his wife betrayed him. Road movies have never felt so intimate—or leisurely.\n\nLove Lies Bleeding\n\nEnglish writer-director Rose Glass follows up her BAFTA-nominated Saint Maud with this twisty, hyper-violent love story. It’s 1989 in a rural New Mexico town where gym manager Lou (Kristen Stewart) is doing her best to stay under the radar and keep an eye on her sister Beth (Jena Malone), who is in an abusive relationship with her husband JJ (Dave Franco). But Lou’s life is turned upside down when Jackie (Katy O'Brian), a gorgeous young bodybuilder, begins coming to Lou’s gym to train for an upcoming competition in Las Vegas. The two fall in love—and then Lou’s hidden family secrets come tumbling out of the closet and threaten her life, and the lives of those she cares about.\n\nFaye\n\n“I’m Faye Dunaway. That’s who I am.” That’s the way the Oscar winner introduces herself in the trailer for Laurent Bouzereau’s feature-length documentary. But what the film reveals is that there’s a lot more to Faye Dunaway than the glamorous image associated with the legendary star of Network. Dunaway opens up in a way that has rarely been seen before, discussing her childhood and family, her struggles with bipolar disorder, and how the characters she has played continue to impact her. It’s a fascinating portrait of a true Hollywood icon.\n\nQuad Gods\n\nJess Jacklin’s feature documentary follows the fascinating journey of Blake, Prentice, and Richard—three individuals with quadriplegia who meet in a neuro-rehabilitation lab at Mount Sinai Hospital and launch a plan to create the world’s first all-quadriplegic esports team. It’s a noble pursuit, but one fraught with challenges as they break down the doors of ableism. At its heart, Quad Gods is a story of friendship, perseverance, and survival.\n\nAm I OK?\n\nLucy (Dakota Johnson) is a thirtysomething living in Los Angeles, constantly failing at relationships and wondering why she doesn’t have everything figured out yet. After drunkenly sharing the story of the time she kissed a female friend as a teen, she begins to realize that the problem in her love life might not be the men she’s choosing, but that she’s choosing men at all. Former Saturday Night Live writer Lauren Pomerantz penned the script for the film based on her own experience of coming out in her thirties. Tig Notaro and her wife Stephanie Allynne do an admirable job as codirectors, treating Lucy’s journey of self-discovery with the respect it deserves—and plenty of humor.\n\nMoviePass, MovieCrash\n\nFor better or worse, millions of film fans will remember 2012 as the year of MoviePass. For $25 per month, you could basically live in a movie theater—which was great for audiences, not so great for movie theaters (which were already struggling), and eventually disastrous for the company itself. For anyone who still has their MoviePass, this revealing documentary tells the real story of all that went wrong behind the scenes, and shares the story of the unsung heroes who really did just want to create a product that movie lovers could embrace. By the way: If you do indeed still have your original MoviePass, this doc has made it a worthwhile piece of memorabilia—with some selling for north of $1,000.\n\nDune & Dune: Part Two\n\nSince breaking through with the Oscar-nominated Incendies (2010), Denis Villeneuve has continued to prove that he’s one of the most talented filmmakers working today. As if making a Blade Runner sequel that didn’t suck wasn’t enough, Villeneuve then went on to crack the cinematic code on Frank Herbert’s Dune series—something that true visionaries like David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky had attempted before him, albeit largely unsuccessfully. Both the 2021 original film and its sequel are streaming on Max—as is Lynch’s 1984 adaptation (which has become a bit of a cult classic over the years). The film follows the fate of the planet Arrakis—and its supply of melange, a unique spice and the most valuable substance in the universe—which rests in the hands of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the untested son of a powerful duke. Looking for more Dune action? The prequel series Dune: Prophecy, starring Emily Watson, Olivia Williams, and Mark Strong is streaming in full.\n\nThe Killing of a Sacred Deer\n\nIf you’re a fan of the absurdly dark work of Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster, Poor Things, Kinds of Kindness) or are just discovering the uncomfortable brilliance of Barry Keoghan, The Killing of a Sacred Deer has got your name written all over it. Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is a highly esteemed surgeon with a loving wife (Nicole Kidman) and children whose life is turned upside down after he befriends Martin (Keoghan), an awkward teen who Steven learns lost his father a few years earlier. What begins as a seeming act of kindness on Steven’s part soon turns into a truly demented version of Sophie’s Choice. As always, Lanthimos’ ability to mix humor with pathos remains unmatched—perhaps never more so than here.\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nIn 1943, Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel) was the commandant of Auschwitz who spent his days playing god with the lives of the concentration camp’s innocent prisoners. But what happened when Höss went home? That’s the reality Jonathan Glazer’s Oscar-winning film examines, and the answer is: Not much. Höss lives right next door to the camp, in the so-called Zone of Interest, with his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) and their five children. Within those four walls, they strive to build a dream life for their family—while the sound of gunshots, incoming trains, and furnaces being lit are just a part of daily life. Yes, it’s every bit as brutal—and necessary—as it sounds.\n\nBlack Swan\n\nNatalie Portman gives what might very well end up being the defining performance of her career in this dark dance drama from Darren Aronofsky. Nina Sayers (Portman) is a dancer with the New York City Ballet whose entire life has been dedicated to her art, in large part due to her overprotective mother (Barbara Hershey), who was also a ballerina and pushes her daughter to have the career she wanted for herself. Nina’s life is turned upside down when she lands the lead in a new production of Swan Lake, only to realize that she’ll be splitting the part with the free-spirited Lily (Mila Kunis) who quickly becomes both the only friend Nina has ever really had and her most bitter rival. Soon, she descends into a dizzying madness that is reflected in Aronofsky’s directorial choices, which make the audience feel every bit of her emotions.\n\nWonka\n\nTimothée Chalamet stars as Willy Wonka in this perfectly entertaining origin story of Roald Dahl’s quirky chocolatier, directed by Paddington’s Paul King. While it doesn’t hit the same as Mel Stuart’s Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory—really, who could match Gene Wilder’s somersaulting candy maker?—it also far surpasses Tim Burton’s fairly needless 2005 remake.\n\nDream Scenario\n\nLike Forrest Gump’s famed box of chocolates, you never know what you’re going to get from a Nicolas Cage performance. But he’s a one-of-a-kind actor whose roles tend to fall into one of two categories: totally transcendent, or scenery-chewing at its most voracious. Dream Scenario is very much the former, and has been heralded as one of the Oscar-winning actor’s best performances by some critics. Rightfully so. Cage stars as Paul Matthews, an unassuming biology professor who suddenly begins appearing in strangers’ dreams and achieves viral fame as a result of it. Like any good Cage performance, this one is multifaceted and examines the downside of sudden fame and what it really costs.\n\nDicks: The Musical\n\nA24—the studio known for its edgy, award-winning indies like Moonlight and Ex Machina—takes a dive into the musical genre with this adaptation of the off-Broadway hit Fucking Identical Twins (and you thought Dicks: The Musical was a raunchy title). Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp cowrote and costar in this over-the-top musical as two coworkers who discover that they’re long-lost twin brothers, and they attempt to Parent Trap their parents (played by Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally). Megan Thee Stallion plays their boss. Anyone offended by an f-bomb—or dozens of them—might want to give this one a skip.\n\nBarbie\n\nGreta Gerwig is a master of breathing new life into old properties (see: Little Women). With Barbie, she has ignited a revolution. Barbie (Margot Robbie) is living her best life in Barbieland—until one day, when her perfectly plastic world, and heels, suddenly begin to collapse. To get her fabulous life back, Barbie must travel to the real world—well, Los Angeles—to determine who or what is causing her existential crisis. The film grossed nearly $1.5 billion worldwide, meaning you've already seen it. But even if you did, it’s absolutely worth a second watch—if only to lament its many Oscar snubs.\n\nRoboCop\n\nFrom Total Recall to Showgirls and back to Basic Instinct, director Paul Verhoeven has a track record almost unmatched in modern cinema. RoboCop, his dystopian take on law enforcement, is proof. Set in a bleak vision of Detroit overrun with crime, it follows a cop (Peter Weller) who gets fatally wounded and turned into, yes, a robot cop, who you might think is good at fighting crime, but of course is not. Some of the visual effects may look a little beat up now, but in 1987, they looked like the future. Also, if RoboCop leaves you wanting more, the film’s two sequels and 2014 reboot—none of which, sadly, were directed by Verhoeven—are also available on Max.\n\nAlbert Brooks: Defending My Life\n\nAlbert Brooks is a comedian’s comedian. Though he might be best known as the filmmaker behind such celebrated comedies as Defending Your Life, Lost in America, Real Life, and Mother, he’s also a brilliant actor (with an Oscar nomination to prove it). Brooks’ longtime pal Rob Reiner directs this charming documentary, which documents Brooks’ one-of-a-kind talent, with a stunning lineup of A-listers—including David Letterman, Steven Spielberg, Sarah Silverman, Judd Apatow, Chris Rock, Larry David, and Ben Stiller—all ready to sing his praises.\n\nReality\n\nIn 2017, an intelligence report about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election was leaked anonymously. One year later, former NSA translator Reality Winner (yes, that’s her real name) was sentenced to more than five years in prison for the crime—the longest sentence ever received by a government whistleblower. HBO’s reigning muse, Sydney Sweeney (Euphoria, The White Lotus), shines in this gripping true story, which plays out mostly in real time as the FBI knocks on the 25-year-old’s door and spends more than an hour questioning her.\n\nAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed\n\nFinding success in one’s lifetime might seem like the dream of every artist, but Nan Goldin has bigger ambitions. Though she’s a photographer by trade, she’s an activist by calling and has long used her camera to capture painfully intimate moments of America in crisis, including extensive work focused on the HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics. But All the Beauty and the Bloodshed reveals the artist in conflict: Should she allow her work to be showcased in one of the prominent museums or galleries that have received endowments from the Sackler family—the Big Pharma family that many blame for America’s opioid crisis? It’s a moving portrait of an artist willing to risk it all for her beliefs.",

        "content": "Once again we are being subjected to another Amazon sale. This time it’s the Big Spring Sale, which takes place from March 25 through March 31. And as is usual with these events, every category you could think of has some sort of deal or promotion going on, from home gear to tech like headphones and speakers. Some of these deals are exclusive to Amazon Prime members.\n\nWe on the WIRED Gear desk are not strangers to these sales and their pitfalls. We’ll be covering actual discounts on products we’ve hand-tested and would recommend to our friends. While the sale hasn’t officially started yet, we’ve found some early discounts and listed the best of them below.\n\nUpdated March 22: We’ve added a handful of new deals on Owala bottles, an Instant Pot air fryer, a Sonos speaker, and the Google Pixel Watch 3.\n\nWIRED Featured Deals:\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\n\nEarly Big Spring Sale Deals\n\nSony WH-1000MX5 Photograph: Sony\n\nWe see this discount frequently, but we’d be remiss not to include it here since it’s the best deal we see for the best headphones we’ve tried. Of the dozens, if not hundreds, of pairs of headphones our reviewers have tested, the WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take the cake in terms of battery life (30 hours), sound quality (thanks to Sony processing and 30-mm drivers), and noise cancelation (complete with automatic audio pausing).\n\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are the best wireless earbuds for Android owners. They’re small and cute, with a supremely comfortable fit and fantastic noise canceling. The battery lasts for eight hours and the sound quality is great, too. They even have IP54 water resistance, so you can take ’em to the gym. It’s not hard to find a good inexpensive pair of earbuds these days, but we don’t see these go on sale very often, making now a better time to pick them up.\n\nWe’ve seen these drop to $329 before, but this is still a solid deal for the Bose QuietComfort Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re our favorite noise-canceling headphones overall, and the sound quality is great too. The design is sleek, and the comfortable fit applies to all three color options that are currently discounted (black, white, and navy blue).\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite Android phones, and this is one of the best price drops we’ve seen for it so far. The 1-TB model is also discounted, though it only applies to the black color. This smartphone is undeniably smart, with a spate of AI features that make your day-to-day life easier—including call screening, Direct My Call (which helps you navigate automated menu options), photo editing features, Circle to Search, and more. The Pixel 9 Pro has an excellent camera, plus a vapor-chamber cooling system that helps dissipate heat better than the base Pixel 9 model. The phone will get software upgrades for seven years. Don’t forget to snag a case!\n\nThe Google Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite smartwatch for Android users. It’s got all the features you’d expect (like fitness and sleep tracking, reliable heart rate measurements, and fall detection), but it also has some bells and whistles including loss of pulse detection and new AI-powered updates specifically for running (though the latter features have some quirks). Reviews editor Julian Chokkattu highly recommends the 45-mm model since the battery life is better.\n\nThis excellent cordless vacuum has fallen to $550 before, but it rarely drops below $600 (and doesn’t go on sale super often). It’s the best Dyson for most people, boasting all the features you need (like strong suction, a 60-minute run time, and a few different attachments). It also has a neon green laser that lights up the floor in front of the vacuum head, which can help you spot dust particles that you might’ve missed otherwise.\n\nPhotograph: Sonos\n\nThe Sonos Era 100 is somewhat predictable in that if it’s not selling for full price, it’s selling for $199. Right now is one of those times where you should buy it if you’ve been eyeing it, as we never see it sell for less. The Sonos Era 100 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Sonos speaker overall. It’s got onboard controls for volume and pausing, and there’s a physical switch to disable the built-in microphone. In true Sonos fashion, the speaker sounds fantastic, with defined, room-filling sound. You can play music via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, and there’s even a room-tuning feature that’ll tweak the audio based on the space the speaker is in.\n\nThe Amazon Fire Max 11 isn’t for everyone, but it’s the best tablet for less than $200. Just be aware that it goes on sale all the time. If you don’t mind needing a workaround for the Google Play Store, and you don’t mind Amazon’s services being pushed at you from every angle, this is a solid budget tablet that‘s good for playing games and watching movies. It charges via USB-C and has hands-free Alexa support.\n\nPhotograph: Birdfy\n\nThis is our favorite smart bird feeder. When we first reviewed the Birdfy Smart Bird Feeder (6/10, WIRED Review), we weren’t impressed with the price or the wonky AI features. But since then, the device has improved, with smarter AI and a lower price tag. The AI doesn’t always correctly identify the birds it sees, but it does a better job than smart feeders from other companies, and it does it at a lower price point (even with the $5 per month subscription, if you choose to get it). It‘s part bird feeder, part security camera, with a 1080p viewing angle and color night vision. This version comes with a solar panel—once it’s mounted and connected, you won’t have to recharge the feeder.\n\nThis smart bird feeder has a pretty unimpressive smartphone app. Its best features (2K video, AI identification) are locked behind a subscription that costs $4 per month or $48 per year. And the subscription isn’t really worth it—the AI was wonky, and the video clips are just 10 seconds long. However, the battery lasts forever thanks to the built-in solar panel—over two months in our reviewer’s testing experience—and there’s a light for night viewing. If you simply want a bird feeder with a camera attached, or you want to see what all the fuss is about, this is a super-affordable option that can help you dip your toes into the world of smart bird feeders.\n\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one of our favorite Dyson vacuums overall. It’s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn’t a robot, this is a great deal on Dyson’s offering.\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nThis countertop appliance went viral on TikTok, and it’s one of the best pizza ovens we’ve tried. The 12-inch cooking surface can reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (which takes around 15 minutes). You’ll need to rotate your pizzas pretty frequently, and it can take a while to cook them since the top lets heat out so quickly. But it’s a good option for anyone looking to make homemade pizzas without needing to stick an appliance in their backyard.\n\nThis little table made our list of the best standing desks. It can be used as a nightside table or an over-bed desk, and it’s easy to move with the built-in wheels. Press the paddle underneath and adjust the height with ease. It’s nice to keep around if you tend to work from the couch or the back patio, and the 28- by 16-inch tabletop gives you just enough room to work without taking up too much space.\n\nThis adorable cat water fountain is our favorite budget-friendly option, and it’s even more affordable once you clip the on-page coupon. The metal bowl is dishwasher-safe, and there’s a clear viewing window so you can easily see the water level. The fountain can be adjusted between a few different configurations (waterfall and two bubble-up modes) so you can choose whichever your cat prefers. Replacement filters are cheap and the reservoir holds 2.4 liters.\n\nPhotograph: Nena Farrell\n\nI know that $5 off doesn’t seem like that big of a deal, but it’s really hard to find discounts on Owala products. And this tumbler is one of our favorite travel mugs, offering the best bang for your buck (at five bucks less than usual). It keeps drinks hot for around six hours and cold for 24, and the color schemes are fun. The slider is easy to use and the bottle is free from lead, BPA, and phthalates.\n\nThis deal is just $2 higher than the best discount we’ve tracked for this bottle, which doesn’t drop in price very often. The FreeSip Twist is the best reusable water bottle—it’s similar to the FreeSip (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but it’s got a twist-off lid rather than a flip-up one. The magic is in the FreeSip design. Slurp your bev up like a straw or tip the bottle back to gulp it down. The tumbler is available in many fun styles and designs and it’s free from lead, BPA, and phthalates.\n\nThe Instant Pot Vortex Plus is the best air fryer we’ve tried. This usually sells for between $140 and $90, and we’ve only seen it drop below this price a few times before. It keeps temperature precisely and it manages to crisp up food without stripping away moisture. The basket preheats quickly and the simple display is intuitive. Reviewer Matthew Korfhage also appreciated the fact that the controls don’t beep—the simple dial keeps things quiet.",

        "title": "The FBI Is Investigating Attacks on Tesla as ‘Domestic Terrorism.’ Here’s Why That Matters",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The US Federal Bureau of Investigation says it’s investigating a series of alleged incidents across the country in which “Tesla charging stations and dealerships were damaged.” On Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi highlighted charges against three people accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla vehicles and, in at least one alleged incident, writing “profane messages against President Trump” near Tesla charging stations, among other crimes.\n\n“Let this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,” Bondi said in a news release detailing the arrests, which were made over the last several weeks in Oregon, Colorado, and South Carolina.\n\nCivil liberties experts claim treating alleged attacks against Tesla cars and infrastructure as terrorist activity could give federal and local law enforcement broad authority to surveil people protesting Elon Musk’s role in the government. The terrorism designation could also allow Musk and other Tesla executives to access information authorities uncover in their investigations.\n\nBondi’s announcement comes ahead of hundreds of grassroots “Tesla Takedown” events protesting Musk and his influence in Washington that are scheduled to take place at Tesla facilities across the US this weekend. The demonstrations have multiplied since they began in mid-February, with some attracting hundreds of people each.\n\nMost of the protests have been peaceful, and the organizers of some of them have said that they don’t endorse property damage. But they are happening amid a string of alleged arson and vandalism cases targeting Tesla dealerships and charging stations, including one in Las Vegas Tuesday morning, as well as others in Colorado and Boston.\n\nBy labeling these and other incidents involving Tesla domestic terrorism, the FBI can file broader search warrants than in other types of cases. Under the Patriot Act, law enforcement gets “special authorities\" while investigating terrorism, including “single-jurisdiction search warrants” from magistrate judges that apply anywhere in the US instead of a single geographic area, according to a 2023 report from the Government Accountability Office. With a court order, law enforcement can additionally get “confidential education records” from any school or agency in the course of a terrorism investigation, the report notes.\n\nThe FBI also has a national network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces that allow the bureau to borrow agents, experts, data, and intelligence from more than 30 federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, including the “Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. military, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration,” as well as local police throughout a particular region.\n\nIn addition to these resources, the FBI has access to surveillance technology that local authorities may not, such as social media surveillance tools, face recognition programs, and allegedly “stingrays” that can intercept data from cell phones.\n\nMost of the powers and resources that law enforcement has access to in a terrorism investigation are also available in other criminal investigations. However, some lawyers have argued that law enforcement tends to exercise the fuller scope of its powers more frequently in the course of terrorism cases.\n\nPrivileged Access\n\nThere aren’t explicit guidelines or laws requiring the FBI to keep companies in the loop when they are targeted in what law enforcement deems “domestic terrorism” incidents. But Michael German, a former FBI special agent and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, says the FBI typically does so anyway. “It would be the FBI's decision to treat the company as a crime victim, so regular exchanges of information are common,” German says.\n\nThat could allow Musk and other Tesla executives to possibly access surveillance data or reports on protesters that aren’t available to the public. Tesla and the Department of Justice did not return requests for comment asking whether they plan to share information with one another about the current ongoing terrorism investigation.",

        "title": "Inside Google’s Two-Year Frenzy to Catch Up With OpenAI",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "But more piles of fascinating research are only useful to Google if they generate that most important of outputs: profit. Most customers generally aren’t yet willing to pay for AI features directly, so the company may be looking to sell ads in the Gemini app. That’s a classic strategy for Google, of course, one that long ago spread to the rest of Silicon Valley: Give us your data, your time, and your attention, check the box on our terms of service that releases us from liability, and we won’t charge you a dime for this cool tool we built.\n\nFor now, according to data from Sensor Tower, OpenAI’s estimated 600 million all-time global app installs for ChatGPT dwarf Google’s 140 million for the Gemini app. And there are plenty of other chatbots in this AI race too—Claude, Copilot, Grok, DeepSeek, Llama, Perplexity—many of them backed by Google’s biggest and best-funded competitors (or, in the case of Claude, Google itself). The entire industry, not just Google, struggles with the fact that generative AI systems have required billions of dollars in investment, so far unrecouped, and huge amounts of energy, enough to extend the lives of decades-old coal plants and nuclear reactors. Companies insist that efficiencies are adding up every day. They also hope to drive down errors to the point of winning over more users. But no one has truly figured out how to generate a reliable return or spare the climate.\n\nAnd Google faces one challenge that its competitors don’t: In the coming years, up to a quarter of its search ad revenue could be lost to antitrust judgments, according to JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth. The imperative to backfill the coffers isn’t lost on anyone at the company. Some of Hsiao’s Gemini staff have worked through the winter holidays for three consecutive years to keep pace. Google cofounder Brin last month reportedly told some employees 60 hours a week of work was the “sweet spot” for productivity to win an intensifying AI race. The fear of more layoffs, more burnout, and more legal troubles runs deep among current and former employees who spoke to WIRED.\n\nOne Google researcher and a high-ranking colleague say the pervasive feeling is unease. Generative AI clearly is helpful. Even governments that are prone to regulating big tech, such as France’s, are warming up to the technology’s lofty promises. Inside Google DeepMind and during public talks, Hassabis hasn’t relented an inch from his goal of creating artificial general intelligence, a system capable of human-level cognition across a range of tasks. He spends occasional weekends walking around London with his Astra prototype, getting a taste of a future in which the entire physical world, from that Thames duck over there to this Georgian manor over here, is searchable. But AGI will require systems to get better at reasoning, planning, and taking charge.\n\nIn January, OpenAI took a step toward that future by letting the public in on another experiment: its long-awaited Operator service, a so-called agentic AI that can act well beyond the chatbot window. Operator can click and type on websites just as a person would to execute chores like booking a trip or filling out a form. For the moment, it performs these tasks much more slowly and cautiously than a human would, and at a steep cost for its unreliability (available as part of a $200 monthly plan). Google, naturally, is working to bring agentic features to its coming models too. Where the current Gemini can help you develop a meal plan, the next one will place your ingredients in an online shopping cart. Maybe the one after that will give you real-time feedback on your onion-chopping technique.\n\nAs always, moving quickly may mean gaffing often. In late January, before the Super Bowl, Google released an ad in which Gemini was caught in a slipup even more laughably wrong than Bard’s telescope mistake: It estimated that half or more of all the cheese consumed on Earth is gouda. As Gemini grows from a sometimes-credible facts machine to an intimate part of human lives—life coach, all-seeing assistant—Pichai says that Google is proceeding cautiously. Back on top at last, though, he and the other Google executives may never want to get caught from behind again. The race goes on.\n\nUpdated 3/21/2025, 4 PM EDT: Wired has clarified the context of a quote attributed to Pandu Nayak.\n\nLet us know what you think about this article.

        "title": "DOGE Is Doing the Opposite of Government Auditing",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Katie Drummond: Right, available to the public, as opposed to DOGE, despite the claims that Musk and even President Trump have made, that this is a maximally transparent group of people doing this work. We don't actually know that much about what they're doing, what they're finding, and the changes that they're making, short of journalists like you and so many of your WIRED colleagues and other news organizations obtaining that information and publishing it. Now, I want to back up a little bit because at the heart of all of this is this notion of fraud, of waste, of financial abuse. It's something that Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed is widespread, pervasive across government agencies that there is fraudulent spending, there is excessive waste happening. There is abuse of financial power, financial authority on the part of these agencies. Now, from what you've reported over the last several months and in your role, how valid is that claim to begin with?\n\nVittoria Elliott: There was a report from the government accountability office that covered the years 2018 to 2022, and that found that there's actually over $200 billion of waste, fraud, or abuse that happens. So it's like, it's not this made-up thing, but in the context of a $7 trillion federal budget, that is not what's breaking the bank. I don't think anyone, Democrat or Republican, DOGE fan or not, would argue that, hey, that's a problem that we need to solve. That's a very valuable thing. But one of the auditors that I spoke to basically said DOGE could go look at the current recommendations from the IGs. They could go look at the current outstanding investigations. They could pick up that work if they are really dedicated to this because there actually are systems, and there actually are reports about this. But from what the auditors I spoke to said, they said that doesn't really seem to be what DOGE is doing. And one of the other things they said was a lot of auditors would probably be really happy to help them, to offer advice. They'd be happy to work with them, they'd be happy to bring young talent into their teams to sort of make the auditing system more robust. But DOGE is really kind of siloed, it doesn't seem like they're really interested in that.\n\nKatie Drummond: Right. Now, speaking of DOGE and the auditors that you spoke to for this story, they certainly didn't have kind words to say about how DOGE is going about its work. Tell us a little bit more about their impressions of DOGE and their commentary on sort of what is happening under the auspices of this idea that Musk and DOGE are essentially auditing the federal government. What do the actual auditors think about that?\n\nVittoria Elliott: Yeah, so to give some context, first off, a regular audit, which involves like five different steps, so there are five steps to an audit. One is where you plan it, you sit down, you say, \"This is what we're looking at, this is the kind of information we're going to need to go after.\" You sort of map out who the stakeholders are, who you're going to have to interview, because a lot of times they're going into programs or systems that maybe they don't fully understand. So, it's almost a little ethnographic. You got to go in, you got to interview people, you got to be like, \"What is your job? What does this connect to? What does this mean inside your system?\" You have to do that baseline understanding of getting to know the program or the agency. Then you do the actual field work, which is, you go out, you talk to people. In the case of, for instance, the hurricane stuff, they actually sent auditors, I believe, to Puerto Rico to see what was going on. You go into the systems, you do that kind of human on the ground legwork. Once you've done that, they sort of pull all this information together into a report, they sort of do this analysis. They talk to the agencies, they say like, \"Hey, these are the problems we found. You have the opportunity to correct these. These are our recommendations.\" And then they submit that to the agencies, to Congress, and then they get to follow up. They get to come back and be like, \"Hey, we recommended this thing. Did you fix this problem?\" There's a level of accountability for trying to fix that thing. So, there are very clear understandings within the government of what the best practice of this is, and all of these people do that. That takes six to 18 months.",

        "title": "Evidence Grows That Dark Energy Changes Over Time",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "That’s what DESI was designed to do: take precise measurements of the apparent size of these bubbles (both near and far) by determining the distances to galaxies and quasars over 11 billion years. That data can then be sliced into chunks to determine how fast the universe was expanding at each point of time in the past, the better to model how dark energy was affecting that expansion.\n\nAn Upward Trend\n\nLast year’s results were based on analysis of a full year’s worth of data taken from seven different slices of cosmic time and include 450,000 quasars, the largest ever collected, with a record-setting precision of the most distant epoch (between 8 to 11 billion years back) of 0.82 percent. While there was basic agreement with the Lamba CDM model, when those first-year results were combined with data from other studies (involving the cosmic microwave background radiation and Type Ia supernovae), some subtle differences cropped up.\n\nEssentially, those differences suggested that the dark energy might be getting weaker. In terms of confidence, the results amounted to a 2.6-sigma level for the DESI’s data combined with CMB datasets. When adding the supernovae data, those numbers grew to 2.5-sigma, 3.5-sigma, or 3.9-sigma levels, depending on which particular supernova dataset was used.\n\nIt's important to combine the DESI data with other independent measurements because “we want consistency,” said DESI co-spokesperson Will Percival of the University of Waterloo. “All of the different experiments should give us the same answer to how much matter there is in the universe at present day, how fast the universe is expanding. It’s no good if all the experiments agree with the Lambda-CDM model, but then give you different parameters. That just doesn't work. Just saying it’s consistent to the Lambda-CDM, that’s not enough in itself. It has to be consistent with Lambda-CDM and give you the same parameters for the basic properties of that model.”\n\nThese latest results cover the first three years of collected data, spanning almost 15 million galaxies and quasars. Once again, the DESI data alone was consistent with Lambda CDM, i.e., the dark energy is constant. And once again, when combined with other datasets—from CMB, supernovae, and weak gravitational lensing studies—strong hints emerged that dark energy might be changing over time. The confidence level ranges from 2.8 to 4.2 sigma, depending on the combination of datasets—just shy of the five-sigma threshold.\n\nThis might strike the average citizen as an incremental advance, but the reality is more complicated. “The DESI data itself is not incremental,” said Percival. “We now have three years of data rather than one year of data. That is substantial, not just because of an increased area but because we’ve increased the overlap. The way we do the survey is we build up plates on the sky, and, after three years rather than one year of operations, we have a lot more of those overlaps filled in. So our data is a lot more complete in the sense that we’ve gone down to the full depth that we expect to get to in more patches. Consequently, our BAO measurements themselves are a lot better. They’re between a factor of two and three better depending on exactly this balance between area versus depth.”",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "But most demonstrations of BCIs have been of one-off capabilities—playing a video game, moving a robotic arm, or piloting a drone, for instance. Synchron is aiming to build a BCI system able to seamlessly perform a wide range of tasks in the home environment. “It’s running in real time, in a real environment 24/7, making predictions where context really matters,” Tom Oxley, Synchron’s CEO, told WIRED in an exclusive interview.\n\nTo do that, Synchron’s BCI will need to be trained on a lot of brain data. As part of its collaboration with Nvidia, the two companies are developing what Oxley has dubbed “cognitive AI,” the combination of large amounts of brain data with advanced computing to create more intuitive BCI systems. Oxley sees cognitive AI as the next phase of AI development following agentic AI, which can act and make decisions independently, and physical AI, the integration of AI with robots and other physical systems.\n\n“What we saw Rodney do is a start, but there are so many more interactions that you can actually begin bringing here,” says David Niewolny, senior director of health care and medtech at Nvidia. With cognitive AI, he says, the mind will be the “ultimate user interface.”\n\nCurrently, BCIs are trained with data from a single person. An individual with a BCI is asked to perform a specific task, such as thinking about moving a cursor left or right. An electrode array collects neural activity from the brain while the person is doing that task and researchers “label” that brain data. In other words, they indicate what the subject was doing at each time point that the brain signal was being measured. That labeled data is used to build an AI model that learns to relate that specific pattern of brain activity to a movement intention.\n\nTo achieve its vision of cognitive AI, Synchron plans to use brain data from its current and future trial participants to build an AI model. Maryam Shanechi, a BCI researcher at the University of Southern California and founding director of its Center for Neurotechnology, says a brain foundation model could improve the accuracy of Synchron’s BCI and allow it to perform a more diverse set of functions without having to collect hours of training data from individual patients.\n\n“This model would be more generalizable, more accurate, and then you can fine-tune it in each subject,” she says. “Because this AI has been trained on the brains of many people, it has essentially learned how to learn, how to think, and then you have this brainlike AI system that you can use for a variety of tasks.”\n\nSome training will still be needed for each new BCI user. Users learn how to operate a BCI with prompts such as “squeeze your fist” or “press down like a brake pedal.” A paralyzed person may not be able to make that motion, but the neurons in their brain’s motor cortex still fire up when they attempt to do so. Those intended movement signals are what BCIs decode. Oxley says Synchron will use Cosmos, Nvidia’s new family of AI models, to generate photorealistic simulations of the user’s body, allowing them to watch an avatar of their own movement and mentally rehearse it.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "There’s an interesting trend in the electric bike industry: Car manufacturers are getting in on the action. One of the latest examples is the Ford Bronco eBike, a motocross-inspired ride that’s so distinctive in appearance that it made everyone from passing drivers to bike mechanics to nostalgic Ford Bronco fans do a double take.\n\nWith an aerodynamic seat suspended over the back wheel and a beefy aluminum frame, the Bronco could be mistaken for a motocross bike. On the other hand, the integrated cockpit with an analog speedometer, plus an enormous headlight that outputs 2000 lumens, makes it feel sort of like a car. Then again, with a 190 x 50 mm rear-coil shock and nubby Pirelli Scorpion Enduro tires, it’s also reminiscent of an enduro mountain bike. Given this mashup, I was curious to see how the thing would ride.\n\nPhotograph: Ford\n\nThrottle Only\n\nThe nearly 68-pound bike has a 750-watt motor (with 85 newton meters of torque) that sits in the rear hub. It offers four power modes: Eco, Normal, Sport, and Baja, the last of which is likely a nod to the kind of riding the bike’s designers envisioned—dirt trails and dunes.\n\nThe Bronco comes in Class II and III versions. The one I tested was Class II, meaning that it is pedal-assist and has a throttle that the rider can control without pedaling. (Class II bikes have a maximum speed limit of 20 miles per hour, but this bike’s speedometer tops out at 40 mph.) The 750 watt-hour battery, permanently tucked into the bike’s beefy down tube, promised a 60-mile range in optimal conditions.\n\nThese stats are about average for enduro-style e-bikes, but I’ve ridden some that are 10 pounds lighter, with 15 newton meters more torque (the higher the torque, the greater the motor’s power and responsiveness). So while the bike looked powerful, I wondered if it actually was.",

Even more visually ambitious than its predecessor, with each alternate reality—and the heroes that call them home, including Gwen Stacey Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Man India (Karan Soni), and Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya)—brought to life with distinctive design and animation styles, Across the Spider-Verse is an almost unspeakably ambitious outing. It's also one that balances sheer spectacle with darker, more emotional conflicts for Miles, offering neither him nor viewers any easy answers. A film so brilliant that the wait for the upcoming third installment, Beyond the Spider-Verse, becomes increasingly painful with every passing day.\n\nTroll\n\nThis gleefully entertaining giant monster movie abandons tearing up Tokyo or New York in favor of director Roar Uthaug’s (2018's Tomb Raider) native Norway, with a titanic troll stomping its way toward Oslo after being roused by a drilling operation. Although the plot and characters will be familiar to any fan of kaiju cinema, the striking Nordic visuals and the titular menace’s ability to blend in with the landscape, allows for some impressively original twists along the way. Although Troll could have easily descended into near-parody, Uthaug steers clear of smug self-awareness and instead delivers, and with a sequel arriving later in 2025, now is the perfect time to revisit one of the freshest takes on the genre in years.\n\nPlankton: The Movie\n\nWould-be evil overlord Plankton finally steals the spotlight in his self-titled SpongeBob spinoff movie—only to immediately lose it to his robot wife Karen when she enacts her own plan to take over the world. Teaming with archnemesis SpongeBob, the diminutive despot soon faces a challenge bigger than stealing the Krabby Patty recipe: learning to listen to his wife. While the SpongeBob movies have been hit or miss, this one is a charming and genuinely funny outing, building on and paying off 25 years (!) worth of SpongeBob in-jokes and online memes. Plankton balances the fine line between being accessible family viewing and fourth-wall-breaking self-referentialism for older fans. Its use of multiple animation styles and live-action sequences makes it visually impressive to boot.\n\nOkja\n\nBefore winning Oscars and cementing his name in the Hollywood firmament with Parasite, Bong Joon-ho had something of a sideline in creature features. While 2006’s The Host remains worth hunting down, this 2017 saga of genetic engineering and animal exploitation may be the director’s pinnacle of the genre. After helping raise an enhanced “super pig” in rural South Korea, young Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun) is distraught when the American company behind its creation, Mirando, comes to take it back. Falling in with a group of Animal Liberation Front activists, Mija travels to Mirando’s headquarters in New York in a desperate effort to rescue her unlikely animal friend. Darkly satirical in places, Okja manages to explore themes of animal exploitation and environmental conservation without feeling preachy.\n\nI Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore\n\nWhen nursing assistant Ruth Kimke (Melanie Lynskey) returns home to discover she's been burgled, the loss of her possessions and the sense of violation isn't her breaking point—that comes later, when faced with disinterested cops and fearful neighbors who don't want to get involved. Attempting to seek justice herself, aided only by outsider and nunchaku aficionado Tony (a brilliantly against-type Elijah Wood), Ruth's decision descends into a disastrous experiment with vigilante justice. A wry but grim look at modern life, Ruth's ultimate goal is best summed up by her answer to “what do you want?” being a blunt “for people to not be assholes.” A treatise on apathy, Macon Blair's 2017 directorial debut was one of Netflix's earlier forays into producing exclusive content, but it remains one of the smartest dark comedies on the platform today.\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nAt first glance, The Two Popes is not a gripping proposition: a film where two very old men in dresses talk a lot, walk around a little bit, and then talk some more. But two top-notch performances from Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins and a stellar script from Anthony McCarten turn this prosaic premise into a film worth watching. Set in the wake of the Vatican leaks scandal and loosely inspired by true events, it follows Cardinal Bergoglio as he tries to convince Pope Benedict XVI to accept his resignation. The two men couldn't be more different—Benedict is an archconservative desperate to cling to tradition while Bergoglio is seen as a dangerous liberalizer who might erode the Church's authority. While the two men battle out their differences, the future of Catholicism hangs in the balance. If you enjoyed the recent Conclave, this is worth your time too.\n\nY Tu Mamá También\n\nIt's uncommon to find much in the way of classic films on Netflix—the algorithm must ever be fed by the churn of the new—so the availability of Alfonso Cuarón's brilliant 2001 coming-of-age movie is a real delight. Set in Mexico in 1999, Y Tu Mamá También (“And your mother, too”) follows rich kid Tenoch (Diego Luna) and his working-class friend Julio (Gael García Bernal) on a road trip with Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the wife of Tenoch’s cousin. It's a journey that sees the young men—still boys, really—competing for attention from the beautiful older woman, trapping themselves in lies and trying to get by on unearned confidence, all while claiming to be heading to a picture-perfect beach that they made up. As for why the much more mature and experienced Luisa would go along with them in the first place? Pack tissues. While the film courted controversy for its frank depiction of sex and drugs (it's not one for family film night), it remains a masterpiece; a raucous and all-too-real examination of young friendships and fragile masculinity.\n\nParasite\n\nDirector Bong Joon-ho's searing 2019 thriller is the first non-English film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it's abundantly clear why. Its bleak exploration of economic disparity and condemnation of capitalistic excess is focused on its South Korea setting, but it resonates with global audiences. Parasite follows the struggling Kim family as they each infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Parks, posing as household servants to live a life of proximate luxury before their deception spirals wildly out of control. Somehow, it's also darkly comedic, mocking the obliviousness of the rich classes, both to their own privileges and to the desperation of the poor. Throughout, it's exquisitely shot and expertly paced, with Bong deftly increasing the tension with every scene until everything approaches a seemingly inevitable conclusion—and then still manages to twist and subvert audience expectations. A spectacular piece of filmmaking that deserves the hype, this examination of class and inequality feels more relevant than ever.\n\nMononoke the Movie: Phantom in the Rain\n\nIn Edo Japan, two young women, Asa and Kame, aim to better their lives by entering the Inner Chambers of the Imperial Palace, where dozens if not hundreds of women exchange comfort for trying to bear a male heir. Yet as they enter, they find themselves trapped in something more like a cult, with a dark and unnatural presence lurking in the heart of the castle. Their only hope is a wandering man known only as the Medicine Seller, possessing the skills and knowledge to exorcise the terrifying force—but men aren’t allowed in. A follow-up to the 2007 TV anime Mononoke (also available on Netflix), this stand-alone outing is not only a masterclass in tension and supernatural horror, but thanks to its stunning visual approach evoking watercolors on parchment, it’s one of the most sumptuous and visually striking pieces of animation you’ll ever see. The first of three planned Mononoke movies, Phantom in the Rain gets this trilogy off to a sensational start.\n\nCarry-On\n\nIs a movie set at Christmas in itself a Christmas movie? That debate has surged around Die Hard for decades. Now Carry-On asks the same question. A zippy thriller from House of Wax and Black Adam director Jaume Collet-Serra, this sees TSA agent Ethan Kopek (Taron Egerton) caught in the Christmas Eve shift from hell when he’s blackmailed by a mercenary known only as the Traveler (Jason Bateman) into allowing a deadly package through security. Cue a lethal game of cat-and-mouse as Ethan tries to stop the Traveler—all with the life of Ethan’s girlfriend Nora (Sofia Carson) in the balance. It’s pulpy and schlocky in places, but this throwback action outing can’t help but entertain.\n\nJoy\n\nIn vitro fertilization may seem like a relatively mundane medical procedure nowadays, one that's brought hope and family to countless people struggling to conceive, but when the procedure was developed by a trio of British scientists and medics in the 1960s and '70s, it was hugely controversial. That makes for powerful material for this dramatization, charting the work of nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie), scientist Robert Edwards (James Norton), and surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Bill Nighy), even as they're demonized by the public, the UK government, and even—perhaps especially—the church. McKenzie in particular is brilliant as Purdy, torn by her own conflict of faith at being involved in the life-changing work, which also involved providing safe abortion care to women who needed it, and struggling to deal with the ostracizing she faces from her family and community as a result. A powerful and provocative drama, even now.\n\nEmilia Pérez\n\nSaying you’ve never seen anything like Emilia Pérez is a wild understatement. Truly, how could anything described as a “trans cartel musical” be anything but arresting to watch? At the onset, Rita (Zoe Saldaña) is an exhausted lawyer in Mexico City doing work her boss takes credit for. Everything changes when she’s contacted by a cartel boss who needs her help to receive gender-affirming care. Rita obliges, launching a partnership between the two that eventually includes launching an organization to help families who have lost members to cartel violence and a (perhaps misguided) effort to reunite the mob boss, the Emilia of the film’s title (played by Spanish actress Karla Sofía Gascón), with the wife and children who believe she’s dead. Full of changes in plot and tone that are all but impossible to see coming, director Jacques Audiard’s latest remains engaging until the final moment.\n\nThe Karate Kid\n\nIf you're hooked on the melee melodrama of Cobra Kai, you owe it to yourself to see where it all began. When Daniel LaRusso's mother moves the family from New Jersey to California, the teenager has to face the greatest threats of 1980s teen cinema: a new school, a daunting crush, and meathead bullies. Outclassed in a brawl with rival Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), Daniel (Ralph Macchio) convinces neighbor Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) to teach him karate. Can Mr. Miyagi's teaching methods—doing chores and learning to “wax on, wax off”—really help Daniel even the odds? Spoiler: yes. Cheesy and incredibly '80s, The Karate Kid remains a fun watch, four decades on.\n\nWoman of the Hour\n\nA serial killer is cast as a bachelor on a dating game show, allowing him to size up his next potential victim right in front of the audience watching at home. That'd be a twisted setup for a slasher flick—but what's horrifying about Woman of the Hour is that it's based on the real-life case of Rodney Alcala, who was a contestant on The Dating Game in 1978 while in the midst of a string of murders. This dramatization isn't centered on the killer, though. In her directorial debut, Anna Kendrick focuses instead on Sheryl (played by Kendrick, based on the real life Cheryl Bradshaw), the one unfortunate enough to be matched with Alcala (Daniel Zovatto), and the women who reported or suspected the killer, only to be routinely ignored by authorities. A taut thriller that makes clear the real horror lies in how easily Acala eluded attention for so long.\n\nDon't Move\n\nSingle-handedly reopening the \"man or bear\" debate, Don't Move follows a grieving young mother named Iris (Kelsey Asbille, Yellowstone) who is hunted through the wilderness after being injected with a paralytic agent by a stranger. With her body slowly shutting down, Iris has 20 minutes to escape or find help, all as her assailant, Richard (Finn Wittrock), coldly, implacably tracks her down. Directed by Adam Schindler and Brian Netto, and produced by Sam Raimi, this expertly paced game of cat-and-mouse rarely lets up, and Asbille gives an incredible performance as the increasingly immobile Iris. If you go down to the woods today … choose the bear.\n\nWill & Harper\n\nWill Ferrell likely needs no introduction, but as former head writer of Saturday Night Live, Harper Steele is more accustomed to life behind the camera. Joining the hit show in the same week back in 1995, the pair struck up a decades-long friendship—so when Harper wrote to tell Ferrell she was transitioning to live as a woman, it was a big change for them both. It also formed the basis for this beautiful, heartwarming, and often laugh-out-loud funny road trip documentary following the duo as they cross the US in an old Jeep Grand Wagoneer, reconnecting and learning what their friendship looks like now. It's awkward viewing at times—some of Ferrell's questions blur the line between bawdy and simply rude—but it's a raw and authentic journey for them both. Beyond the personal touches, Will & Harper is a timely view of what America looks like for a trans person right now, making it possibly one of the most important documentaries Netflix has produced.\n\nHis Three Daughters\n\nAs their father approaches the end of his life, sisters Rachel (Natasha Lyonne), Katie (Carrie Coon), and Christina (Elizabeth Olsen) are forced to reconnect while waiting for the inevitable. Bleak stuff, but also grounds for masterful performances from the lead trio, with Rachel having taken on the bulk of care for months, Katie casting imperious demands despite avoiding the situation, and new-agey Christina trying to keep the peace—despite being at a breaking point herself. This is almost a locked-room piece, the apartment trapping the women, forcing them to come to terms with not only their father's death but their own relationships with each other, all while Vincent (Jay O. Sanders) haunts them even before his passing. Death may loom over director Azazel Jacobs’ drama, but His Three Daughters ultimately proves oddly life-affirming.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies\n\nWhen Seita and his young sister Setsuko are orphaned in the wake of the fire-bombing of Kobe during the final days of World War II, the siblings are forced into terrible circumstances to survive. Stuck between abusive extended family and the sheer desperation of scavenging around the ruins of their destroyed hometown, it's a bleak existence—and also the basis for one of Studio Ghibli's finest works. Directed by Isao Takahata and based on a short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave of the Fireflies is unapologetically harrowing in its exploration of how war and nationalism chew up the most vulnerable, yet peppered with moments of unwavering love as Seita attempts to protect Setsuko's innocence. This searing wartime drama is sobering but essential viewing, a film that's more than earned its ranking in the upper echelons of the Best Studio Ghibli films.\n\nRebel Ridge\n\nWhen corrupt cops run ex-Marine Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) off the road for cycling while Black, they also seize the money he had been planning to use to post his cousin’s bail. Despite the injustice, Terry tries to do everything by the book but finds almost every aspect of the legal system against him. Out of patience, and fueled by immensely justified anger, he sets about tearing out the rot from the small town, aided only by court clerk Summer (AnnaSophia Robb). Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier could have made Rebel Ridge merely a modern day First Blood, but while there’s plenty of visceral, bone-breaking fight scenes, it’s the film’s righteously angry look at the baked-in failings of the American legal system that gives this its bite—all while cementing Pierre as an action star to watch.\n\nWicked Little Letters\n\nBased on real events, Wicked Little Letters is set in 1920, in the quaint English town of Littlehampton. When the well-to-do family of Edith Swan starts receiving abusive mail, Irish immigrant Rose Gooding—who has a reputation as a foul-mouthed troublemaker, and who recently fell out with Edith—is suspect number one. Yet as the plague of \"poison pen\" notes spreads, becoming a national scandal, only overlooked police officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) believes that Rose is being set up. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman is on top form as Edith, while Jessie Buckley delights with a fiery performance as Rose in this surprisingly uproarious comedy.\n\nUnder Paris\n\nThis so-serious-it's-ludicrous French creature feature sees Bérénice Bejo as marine specialist Sophia Assalas, who is hunting down a mako shark that has not only spontaneously mutated to survive in the freshwater Seine but is also about to give birth to a host of baby man-eating sharks. Worse still? Paris is about to hold a triathlon, with the swim portion set to become an all-you-can-eat buffet! Look, not everything on this list needs to be high art—sometimes, you just need to see a mutant shark straight up chomping on people while increasingly desperate humans start blowing stuff up. Press Play, turn brain off, enjoy.\n\nHit Man\n\nGary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a mild-mannered professor of philosophy—and a contract killer. Well, not quite. He just poses as one, working with the New Orleans Police Department to trap people looking to hire a hit man. It's a role he's surprisingly good at, but when Madison (Adria Arjona) looks to have her abusive husband “dealt” with, Gary begins to fall for her—and the consequences could be fatal for real. In another creator’s hands, Hit Man might have been either overly grim or simply insubstantial (it's loosely based on a true story), but director Richard Linklater leverages his signature uses of sparkling dialog and brilliantly realized characters to deliver a smart action-comedy that explores the roles people play in society as much as it serves up mistaken-identity hijinks.\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nDespite the presence of the eponymous kaiju, Godzilla Minus One is a film rooted in the humanity of its protagonists, deserter kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) and Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), a survivor of the bombings of Tokyo. Thrown together as an ersatz family as they raise an orphaned baby, their attempts to build a new life turn chaotic when the irradiated reptile descends on the city just as it's beginning to recover. Director Takashi Yamazaki's reimagining of Japan's premier kaiju netted the King of Monsters its first-ever Oscar, picking up a statue for Best Visual Effects at the 2024 Academy Awards, but this is a film that exceeds mere spectacle—it's a searing examination of life after war, and how a nation grapples with being on the losing side.\n\nSuzume\n\nSuzume Iwato (voiced by Nanoka Hara in Japanese, Nichole Sakura in English) lives with her aunt on Japan's southern island, having lost her mother in the Tōhoku earthquake of 2011. When a handsome young stranger named Souta (Hokuto Matsumura, Josh Keaton) asks her for directions to some local ruins, she follows him out of curiosity but disturbs a living keystone, accidentally unleashing an ancient power that threatens to destroy the entire country. Drawn into Souta's world, the pair chase the keystone, now in the form of a cat, across Japan in a desperate bid to reseal the destructive entity—a quest that would be easier if Souta hadn't been transformed into a child's wooden chair. The latest film from Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, Weathering with You), Suzume is a breathtakingly animated slice of magical realism with a surrealist edge—but beyond the spectacle, it's a heart-warming tale of community and humanity, each stop on the unlikely pair's journey a snapshot of people and families coming together in the wake of tragedy.\n\nMaboroshi\n\nBy any measure, Masamune lives a normal teenage existence in his rural Japanese hometown—until the local steel works erupts, mysteriously sealing the entire town in an inexplicable time bubble where no one ages. As the small community struggles to adapt, a culture that fears change emerges, initially from the presumption that residents would need to rejoin the outside world as they left it, and eventually forbids even new relationships. Yet when Masamune's strange classmate Mutsumi lures him to the ill-fated factory and introduces him to a feral young girl who should not exist, the bizarre reality they all inhabit begins to collapse. A fantasy twist on notions of youthful rebellion, the prison of familiarity, and fears of change, Maboroshi—meaning \"illusion\"—is a dazzling sophomore feature from director Mari Okada—whose 2018 debut Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms won accolades around the globe—and one that firmly establishes her as one of the most exciting creators working in animation today.\n\nRustin\n\nDirected by George C. Wolfe (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom), this biopic explores the life of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. While perhaps best known as one of the chief organizers of 1963's March on Washington, Rustin was also openly, unapologetically gay at a time when that was phenomenally rare—and the film doesn't shy away from how that alienated many of the people he worked with, his sexuality often seen as a threat to the movement. A much-needed spotlight on an overlooked but pivotal figure in the Civil Rights Movement, elevated by a central performance from a spectacularly well-cast Colman Domingo as Rustin himself.\n\nHis House\n\nFleeing war-torn South Sudan, Bol (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are now living in a run-down house at the edge of London, harassed by their neighbors even as they try to fit in. The couple are also haunted by the lives they left behind—both figuratively and (possibly) literally, with visions of their late daughter Nyagak, who did not survive the journey, fading in and out of the walls of their dismal new home. The real horror of His House isn't the strange visions, haunted house, or potential ghosts, though—it’s the bleakness of the lives Bol and Rial are forced into, the hostility and dehumanization of the UK asylum process, the racism both overt and casual, all coupled with the enormous sense of loss they carry with them. Blending the macabre with the mundane, director Remi Weekes delivers a tense, challenging film that will haunt viewers as much as its characters.\n\nThe Black Book\n\nPaul Edima (Richard Mofe-Damijo) lives a peaceful life as a church deacon, trying to atone for—or at least forget—his former deeds as a highly trained special agent. Plans to leave his violent and bloody past behind fall apart when his son is framed for a murder and then killed by corrupt police, forcing him to fall back on old skills as he seeks vengeance. Shades of Taken, yes, but it's director Editi Effiong's raw energy and fresh takes on familiar action movie formulas that—backed by one of the highest budgets in \"Nollywood\" history—have this gritty outing topping the most-watched lists as far afield as South Korea. Expand your cinematic horizons and see what the fuss is about.\n\nThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\n\nIgnore its 41-minute runtime and set aside any arguments over whether its brevity \"counts\" as a movie—this fantastic outing sees Wes Anderson adapt a Roald Dahl work for the first time since 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the result is just as brilliant. Rather than stop-motion, as with Mr. Fox, this is a live-action affair headlined by a top tier performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as the eponymous Henry Sugar, a bored rich man who gains a strange power and ultimately uses it to better the world. With a broader cast including Dev Patel, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley, and shot with all of Anderson's trademark aesthetic sensibilities, this really is a wonderful story. And, if you're still bothered by the short run time, take solace in the fact that this forms a tetraptych with The Rat Catcher, The Swan, and Poison; 15-minute shorts with same cast, directed by Anderson, and all adapting other Dahl tales in his signature style.\n\nEldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate\n\nCentered on the eponymous Berlin nightclub, this documentary explores the lives of LGBTQ+ people during the interwar years, from the roaring 1920s through the rise of the Nazis and into the horrors of World War II. With a blend of archival footage, recreations, and first-person accounts, director Benjamin Cantu paints a picture of gleeful decadence, the Eldorado as an almost hallowed ground where performers and patrons alike experimented with gender expression and were free to openly display their sexuality. It's an ode to what was lost, but with an eye on the bizarre contradictions of the age, where openly gay club-goers would wear their own Nazi uniforms as the years went by. Everything the Nazis Hate is emotionally challenging viewing in places, but it serves up an important slice of queer history that many will be completely unaware of.\n\nMarry My Dead Body\n\nWu Ming-han (Greg Hsu) is not a great guy. A homophobic police officer, his life—and prejudices—are changed when he picks up an unassuming red envelope while investigating a case. Now bound under “ghost marriage” customs to Mao Mao (Austin Lin), a gay man who died under mysterious circumstances, Wu has to solve his “husband's” death before he can get on with his life. Directed by Cheng Wei-hao, better known for his thrillers and horror movies, Marry My Dead Body sees the Taiwanese director bring his supernatural stylings to this ghostly absurdist comedy for a film that transcends borders.\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone\n\nDrug dealer Fontaine (John Boyega) got shot to death last night. So why has he just woken up in bed as if nothing happened? That existential question leads Fontaine and two unlikely allies—prostitute Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) and pimp Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx)—to uncovering a vast conspiracy centered on a Black-majority town called The Glen, where people are kept mollified by hypnotic rap music, dumbed down with drug-laced fried chicken and grape juice, and preached into obedience at church. But who’s using the town as a petri dish, and why is there a cloning lab buried underground? This lethally sharp satire from writer and debut director Juel Taylor masterfully blends genres, from the use of visual motifs and dated clichés from 1970s Blaxploitation cinema to its frequent steps into sci-fi territory and laugh-out-loud comedy. But it’s the powerhouse performances from its central cast that mark this as one to watch.\n\nNimona\n\nShapeshifter Nimona can become anything she wants, a gift that causes people to fear and shun her. If society is going to treat her like a villain, she's going to be one, so she decides to become the sidekick of the hated black knight, Ballister Blackheart. Unfortunately for the aspiring menace, Blackheart isn't quite the monster he's made out to be, and he instead tries to rein in Nimona's more murderous tendencies as he seeks to clear his name of a crime he didn't commit—and face down his old friend Ambrosius Goldenloin in the process. Adapted from N. D. Stevenson's groundbreaking graphic novel, Nimona is more than just another fanciful fantasy—it's a tale of outsiders and exiles, people trying to do right even when their community rejects them, and the joy of finding their own little band along the way. After an almost decade-long journey to the screen, this dazzlingly animated movie has become an instant classic.\n\nThe Boys in the Band\n\nSet in New York City in 1968, The Boys in the Band is a snapshot of gay life a year before Stonewall brought LGBTQ+ rights to mainstream attention. When Michael (Jim Parsons, fresh from The Big Bang Theory) hosts a birthday party for his best frenemy Harold (Zachary Quinto), he’s expecting a night of drinks, dancing, and gossip with their inner circle—until Alan, Michael’s straight friend from college, turns up, desperate to share something. As the night wears on, personalities clash, tempers fray, and secrets threaten to come to the surface in director Joe Mantello’s tense character study. Adapted for the screen by Mart Crowley, author of the original stage play, this period piece manages to be as poignant an exploration of queer relationships and identities as ever.\n\nCargo\n\nIn a world already ravaged by a zombie-like plague, Andy Rose (Martin Freeman) only wants to keep his family safe, sticking to Australia’s rural back roads to avoid infection. After his wife is tragically bitten, and infects him in turn, Andy is desperate to find a safe haven for his infant daughter, Rosie. With a mere 48 hours until he succumbs himself, Andy finds an ally in Thoomi (Simone Landers), an Aboriginal girl looking to protect her own rabid father. But with threats from paranoid survivalists and Aboriginal communities hunting the infected, it may already be too late. A unique twist on the zombie apocalypse, Cargo abandons the familiar urban landscapes of the genre for the breathtaking wilds of Australia and offers a slower, character-led approach to the end of the world.\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio\n\nThe modern master of the macabre brings the wooden would-be boy to life like never before in this exquisitely animated take on Pinocchio. In a stop-motion masterpiece that hews closer to the original 1880s tale by Carlo Collodi than the sanitized Disney version, Guillermo del Toro adds his own signature touch and compelling twists to the classic story that make it darkly enchanting—expect a Blue Fairy closer to a biblically accurate many-eyed angel and a Terrible Dogfish more like a kaiju. It’s the decision to transplant the tale to World War II that’s most affecting though. Cast against the rise of fascism, with Gepetto mourning the loss of his son, the film is packed with complex themes of mortality and morality that will haunt audiences long after the credits roll. If that doesn't sell you, perhaps the fact that it won Best Animated Feature at the 2023 Academy Awards will.\n\nCall Me Chihiro\n\nAn idyllic slice-of-life movie with a twist, Call Me Chihiro follows a former sex worker—the eponymous Chihiro, played by Kasumi Arimura—after she moves to a seaside town to work in a bento restaurant. This isn’t a tale of a woman on the run or trying to escape her past—Chihiro is refreshingly forthright and unapologetic, and her warmth and openness soon begin to change the lives of her neighbors. Directed by Rikiya Imaizumi, this is an intimate, heartfelt character drama that alternates between moments of aching loneliness and sheer joy, packed with emotional beats that remind viewers of the importance of even the smallest connections.\n\nThe Sea Beast\n\nIt's easy to imagine that the elevator pitch for The Sea Beast was “Moby Dick meets How to Train Your Dragon”—and who wouldn’t be compelled by that? Set in a fantasy world where oceanic leviathans terrorize humanity, those who hunt down the giant monsters are lauded as heroes. Jacob Holland (voiced by Karl Urban) is one such hero, adopted son of the legendary Captain Crowe and well on the way to building his own legacy as a monster hunter—a journey disrupted by stowaway Maisie Brumble (Zaris-Angel Hator), who has her own ambitions to take on the sea beasts. However, after an attempt to destroy the colossal Red Bluster goes disastrously wrong, Jacob and Maisie are stranded on an island filled with the creatures, and they find that the monsters may not be quite so monstrous after all. A rollicking sea-bound adventure directed by Chris Williams—of Big Hero 6 and Moana fame—it secured its standing as one of Netflix’s finest movies with a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars.\n\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\n\nDaniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc in this brilliant follow-up to 2019’s phenomenal whodunnit, Knives Out. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a fiendishly sharp new case for “the Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths,” taking Blanc to a Greek island getaway for a reclusive tech billionaire and his collection of friends and hangers-on, where a planned murder mystery weekend takes a deadly turn. While totally accessible for newcomers, fans of the first film will also be rewarded with some deeper character development for Blanc, a role that’s shaping up to be as iconic for Craig as 007. As cleverly written and meticulously constructed as its predecessor, and featuring the kind of all-star cast—Edward Norton! Janelle Monáe! Kathryn Hahn! Leslie Odom Jr.! Jessica Henwick! Madelyn Cline! Kate Hudson! Dave Bautista!—that cinema dreams are made of, Glass Onion might be the best thing Netflix has dropped all year.\n\nThe Wonder\n\nFlorence Pugh dazzles in this not-quite-horror film from Oscar-winning director Sebastián Lelio. Set in 1862, English nurse Lib Wright (Pugh) is sent to Ireland to observe Anna O’Donnell, a girl who claims to have not eaten in four months, subsisting instead on “manna from heaven.” Still grieving the loss of her own child, Lib is torn between investigating the medical impossibility and growing concern for Anna herself. Amid obstacles in the form of Anna’s deeply religious family and a local community that distrusts her, Lib’s watch descends into a tense, terrifying experience. Based on a book of the same name by Emma Donoghue, The Wonder is a beautiful yet bleakly shot period piece that explores the all-too-mortal horrors that unquestioning religious fervor and family secrets can wreak.\n\nRRR\n\nOne of India’s biggest films of all time, RRR (or Rise, Roar, Revolt) redefines the notion of cinematic spectacle. Set in 1920, the historical epic follows real-life Indian revolutionaries Alluri Sitrama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) but fictionalizes their lives and actions. Although they come from very different walks of life, their similarities draw them together as they face down sadistic governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his cruel wife, Catherine (Alison Doody). No mere period fluff, RRR is a bold, exciting, and often explosive piece of filmmaking that elevates its heroes to near-mythological status. Director S. S. Rajamouli deploys brilliantly shot action scenes—and an exquisitely choreographed dance number—that grab viewers’ attention and refuse to let go. Whether you’re a longtime fan of Indian cinema or just looking for an action flick beyond the Hollywood norm, RRR is not to be missed.\n\nI Lost My Body\n\nAn award winner at Cannes in 2019, this tale of burgeoning young love, obsession, and autonomous body parts is every bit as weird as you might expect for a French adult animated film. Director Jérémy Clapin charts the life of Naoufel, a Moroccan immigrant in modern-day France who falls for the distant Gabrielle, and Naoufel’s severed hand, which makes its way across the city to try to reconnect. With intersecting timelines and complex discussions about fate, I Lost My Body is often mind-bending yet always captivating, and Clapin employs brilliantly detailed animation and phenomenal color choices throughout. Worth watching in both the original French and the solid English dub featuring Dev Patel and Alia Shawkat, this one dares you to make sense of it all.\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nFrustrated by the world’s collective inaction on existential threats like climate change? Maybe don’t watch Don’t Look Up, director Adam McKay’s satirical black comedy. When two low-level astronomers discover a planet-killing comet on a collision course with Earth, they try to warn the authorities—only to be met with a collective “meh.” Matters only get worse when they attempt to leak the news themselves and have to navigate vapid TV hosts, celebrities looking for a signature cause, and an indifferent public. A bleakly funny indictment of our times, bolstered by a star-studded cast fronted by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, Don’t Look Up is, somewhat depressingly, one of the best portraits of humanity since Idiocracy.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Commercial quadcopters have been on the mainstream gadget scene for 15 years, proliferating across industries and among hobbyists. There's a swanky DJI store on New York City's Fifth Avenue, and you probably have a neighbor, not to mention a roofer, who owns a drone. So when researchers at the embedded-device security firm Red Balloon started seeing surprising quadcopter accessories on Chinese shopping platforms like Temu and AliExpress, they didn't think much of it at first. As with any popular gadget type, there's a whole ecosystem of niche, wacky, and comical add-ons available for drones. But the more Red Balloon CEO Ang Cui thought about it, the more unsettled he and his colleagues became about how cheap and easy it would be for anyone to buy seemingly disparate add-ons that could easily turn a mainstream quadcopter into a war machine.\n\nThe accessories the researchers found include AI drone guidance modules—essentially small mounted cameras that use object recognition to identify humans and road vehicles at long range—and miles-long fiber optic tethers. Like plugging an ethernet cable directly into your laptop, miles-long tethers allow drones to fly around a large area without being vulnerable to disruption by signal jammers. The researchers recognized them from battlefield footage and other reports that such tethers—not to mention AI guidance modules—are being used by both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war to drop explosives or autopilot crash entire drones themselves into tracked objects without requiring operator control.\n\nThe fact that battlefield technology is widely available in the United States and around the world at low cost augurs a climate in which any actor—from criminal syndicates to paramilitary groups, from disgruntled employees to ostracized teens—can quickly and cheaply gather the needed equipment to remotely go on a destructive and violent rampage.\n\n“The more we looked at this and started to see the big picture, the more my heart sank, because these are toys that are really amazing at killing people,” Cui tells WIRED. “This tech didn't exist in the commercial space two years ago, it wasn't in demand from hobbyists, but now manufacturers are making it for war and it's spilling over.”\n\nThe Red Balloon researchers found that long-range quadcopters are readily available on marketplaces like AliExpress for under $300, with many priced at around $200 each. And the unit price of a long-range drone can drop even lower when purchased in bulk. The researchers noticed sellers who were claiming that they ship 60,000 of the long-range drones per month. They purchased a 1-mile-long tether from a seller on AliExpress for about $260 and another that is 7.5 miles long for about $700. Meanwhile, the researchers also purchased an AI guidance module from a different AliExpress seller for $325. Cui and his colleagues also purchased cargo holders that strap to drones and can be used to transport beer cans or water bottles, but could also be loaded with mortar bombs. These were $106 each. In the two months since the researchers made the purchases, they say the prices of most of the products they bought have even dropped slightly.\n\n“This equipment is mainstream, but it does not just cost a few dollars to make, so I think this stuff is being sold either at or below cost,” Cui says.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "I learned how to lift in college when I was running track, and I fell in love with the feeling of a heavy dead lift, squat, and clean. I’ve been lifting for the last decade, but it’s never been the same since I lost access to my elite college weight room. I mostly work out at home with adjustable dumbbells and kettlebells, but I’ve reached a point where I need something heavier. I need my barbell and plates back.\n\nSo I was stoked to review the Speediance Gym Monster 2, a magnetic-resistance cable machine that looks a lot like a normal weight-lifting rack but can fit in my home. I’ve been using it for a month now, and I’ve totally integrated it into my workout routine. I really enjoy using it (I didn’t love the past magnetic-resistance machine I tried), and it’s allowed me to step up my big lifts, like dead lifts, squats, and bench presses.\n\nPhotograph: Kristin Canning\n\nTricked Out\n\nThe Gym Monster 2 is a magnetic-resistance cable machine with a rack, screen, foldable platform (with a removable squishy pad), and so. Many. Accessories. The standard package comes with a bench, adjustable barbell, barbell hooks, barbell pad, tricep rope, cable handles, extender belt, ankle straps, and a Bluetooth ring and clip (more on what that does later). This is the second version (duh) and is more compact and lighter then the first iteration, and has one higher level for the cables on the rack pillars.\n\nIt was really easy to set up—no assembly required. It has a small footprint. When folded, it’s 14.6 inches long by 27.2 wide by 72.8 tall; unfolded, it’s 48.0 inches long. With a total resistance of 220 pounds, it can’t help you with your heaviest lifting, but the smart features and easy-to-use system make it a really cool home workout machine.\n\nPrice-wise, it’s a little less than the Tonal 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends), and you also don’t need to subscribe to a membership to access most of the workouts.\n\nPhotograph: Kristin Canning\n\nThere’s a lot to love about the Gym Monster 2. It feels much more like a traditional weight-lifting rack than other magnetic-resistance cable machines I’ve used in the past, thanks to the two tall pillars that can hold the cables. Similar machines, like the Vitruvian Trainer+ that I’ve tried, have cables that attach only to the platform, which makes certain lifts and positioning quite challenging.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Knifings, firebombings, shootings, and murder-for-hire plots—all linked to a splinter group of the 764 crime network called “No Lives Matter.” According to its own manifesto, the group seeks to “purify mankind through endless attacks” and has released at least two “kill guides” tied to violent plots in the US and Europe. Intelligence documents reviewed by WIRED reveal growing concern among analysts, but experts remain unsure how to stop the group’s spread.\n\nOn Monday, X experienced intermittent outages after a botnet flooded the social network with junk traffic in an attempt to take down its system. Elon Musk stated that the distributed denial-of-service attack originated from Ukrainian IP addresses, implying that the country—already under siege by a Russian invasion and frequently mocked by the centibillionaire—may have been responsible. Security experts tell WIRED that this is not how DDoS attacks work.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, mass layoffs are hurting US cyberdefense, weakening protections against foreign adversaries. Vital staff cuts have left employees overworked and strained international partnerships, according to interviews with staff at the agency that helps safeguard cities, businesses, and nonprofits from cyberattacks. “A lot of people are scared,” says one employee. “We’re waiting for that other shoe to drop. We don't know what's coming.” As WIRED takes you inside the agencies at the center of the uncertainty and chaos of the second Trump administration, we've updated our quick and easy guide to using Signal to help you get the most out of the messaging app’s end-to-end encryption.\n\nThat’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nThose “green bubbles,” the cross-platform text messages that annoy iPhone owners and keep Android users relegated to a group-chat underclass, aren’t just a cultural disconnect. They’re also a security issue: Text messages sent between Android and iOS devices—unlike blue-bubble iMessage texts or Android-to-Android messages—aren’t end-to-end encrypted, leaving them open to surveillance or interception. Now, that may finally be changing.\n\nThe GSM Association, responsible for many widely used telecom standards, this week announced that its Rich Communication Services (or RCS) protocol will now support end-to-end encryption for cross-platform texting, and Apple revealed that it will now integrate that feature of RCS into its iOS devices. Until now, Apple and Google had both supported RCS’s other features in texts sent between iOS and Android, but not end-to-end encryption, which ensures that only the devices sending and receiving messages can decrypt them and not any server or snoop that sees them in transit.\n\nNeither Apple nor the GSMA has said exactly when the new privacy features are launching. Until then, anyone sending cross-platform messages would be wise to stick with apps like WhatsApp or Signal that have long provided end-to-end encryption—and have also helped Android and iPhone users avoid personal disputes over bubble colors.\n\nThe White House has tapped Sean Plankey to run CISA, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security primarily responsible for American digital defense. Plankey, long considered the leading contender for the role, served in multiple cybersecurity positions in the first Trump administration and previously held senior roles in US Cyber Command. In that DOD agency focused on cyber offense, he served as a weapons and tactics branch chief and earned a Bronze Star for hacking operations in Afghanistan. CISA, like many federal agencies, has faced hundreds of personnel cuts in recent weeks, and its previous director, Chris Krebs, came under harsh criticism under the previous Trump administration for the agency’s work to counter disinformation and secure elections. Krebs was fired in a Trump tweet near the end of his term after CISA described the 2020 election, whose results Trump baselessly contested, as the “most secure in American history.”\n\nNot even the National Security Agency has been spared from Elon Musk’s scorched-earth campaign to gut the federal government. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had visited the intelligence agency in Fort Meade, meeting with leadership to discuss staff reductions and operational changes, according to current and former US officials who spoke to the Journal.\n\nDespite being one of the most insulated branches of US intelligence, the NSA has still found itself pulled into Musk’s orbit. The visit to Fort Meade is another sign of the sweeping nature of his influence and the extraordinary access the world’s richest man has been granted over even the most secretive federal operations.",

        "title": "A Mysterious Startup Is Developing a New Form of Solar Geoengineering",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "This story originally appeared on Undark and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nIn July 2012, a renegade American businessman, Russ George, took a ship off the coast of British Columbia and dumped 100 tons of iron sulfate dust into the Pacific Ocean. He had unilaterally, and some suggest illegally, decided to trigger an algae bloom to absorb some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere—an attempt at geoengineering, a tech-based approach to combating climate change. It was a one-off, the largest known geoengineering experiment at the time, and a harbinger for more to come.\n\nNow a startup called Stardust seeks something more ambitious: developing proprietary geoengineering technology that would help block sun rays from reaching the planet. Stardust formed in 2023 and is based in Israel but incorporated in the United States.\n\nIts approach is novel: Most geoengineering research today is led by scientists in the US at universities and federal agencies, and the work they are doing is more or less accessible to public scrutiny. Stardust is at the forefront of an alternative path: One in which private companies drive the development, and perhaps deployment, of technologies that experts say could have profound consequences for the planet.\n\nGeoengineering projects, even those led by climate scientists at major universities, have previously drawn the ire of environmentalists and other groups. Such a deliberate transformation of the atmosphere has never been done, and many uncertainties remain. If a geoengineering project went awry, for example, it could contribute to air pollution and ozone loss, or have dramatic effects on weather patterns, such as disrupting monsoons in populous South and East Asia.\n\nBut as global temperatures rise, public and scientific sentiments are shifting. If those temperature trends continue, governments or private entities may ultimately use geoengineering to alleviate or avoid the worst impacts of extreme weather, including deadly heat waves, firestorms, and hurricanes. And whoever deploys the technology will need to keep it up for decades while pent-up greenhouse gases gradually dissipate or are removed.\n\nFew outsiders have gotten a glimpse of Stardust’s plans, and the company has not publicly released details about its technology, its business model, or exactly who works at its company. But the company appears to be positioning itself to develop and sell a proprietary geoengineering technology to governments that are considering making modifications to the global climate—acting like a kind of defense contractor for climate alteration.\n\nStardust is moving ahead amid few national and international rules and limited oversight, and a recent report by the company’s former climate governance consultant, Janos Pasztor, called for the company to increase its transparency, engagement, and communication with outsiders. The report provides rare insight into the reticent company. But, so far, Pasztor told Undark, the company has not met all of his requests. Stardust still needs to implement his recommendations, and “be as transparent as possible, be available proactively to respond to questions people may have, and also to engage with other actors,” he said, because they do not, or not yet, have a “social license” for geoengineering activities.",

        "title": "BYD's 5-Minute EV Charging Sounds Great. But How Useful Is it?",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "When surveys ask potential car buyers why they’re not going electric, the answer is consistent: It’s the charging. Drivers understand gas; plugging in, less so. They’re worried about waiting around for a charger, which, depending on its power, can take anywhere between 20 minutes and eight hours to fill up a battery.\n\nSo the hubbub around a surprise announcement from Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD makes sense. The automaker said this week that two new vehicles set to launch in April will be able to add 250 miles of range in just five minutes.\n\nThat’s twice as fast as even the next generation of Tesla Superchargers. (The day of BYD’s announcement, Tesla stock dropped by five percent.)\n\nTopping up in five minutes makes for great ad copy, and could go a long way to alleviating drivers’ concerns about EVs. But practically speaking, experts say, it might not be the gigantic charging breakthrough it seems.\n\nBYD says the superfast charging is made possible by an “all liquid-cooled megawatt flash-charging terminal system,” according to Bloomberg, plus a new, automotive-grade silicon carbide power chip. The combination should allow the vehicle to channel up to 1,000 volts of charge. That’s a small but significant jump compared to competitors, at least among passenger vehicles. Generally, the higher the voltage, combined with sufficient amperage, or electrical flow, the faster the charge. Most popular EVs, including the Tesla Model 3, are built on 400-volt \"platforms,\" which are usually cheaper to manufacture, though 800-volt models are on the rise. The upcoming Lucid Gravity, meanwhile, has a 926-volt powertrain. BYD trumps it all.\n\nThe more significant BYD innovation, though, may be in its chargers, which the automaker indicates should be able to take advantage of that 1,000-volt capability. BYD says it will build 4,000 of them in China, though hasn’t provided any specifics about when, where, and how. (The automaker didn’t respond to WIRED’s questions.)\n\nGetting those fast chargers in the ground likely won’t be a simple task. “It’s going to take a while,” says Gil Tal, who directs the Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC Davis. Building charging stations can already be a multimonth, if not multiyear journey in most countries, due partially to lengthy permitting processes, but also the time it takes to find, build, and assemble charging components.\n\nWhat’s more, larger megawatt charging stations have larger megawatt power needs, and might require pricey grid connection updates. Plus, an advanced liquid-cooled system, like the kind described by BYD, needs thick, heavy, and specially manufactured cables and connectors that can dissipate heat quickly. “They need more copper, more cooling, more everything,” says Tal. That means more up-front building expenses, which could be passed on to drivers in higher charging prices.\n\nDespite the lack of detail from BYD, EV industry experts know some of these things because super fast charging isn’t new. Megawatt charging systems that can deliver up to 1,250 volts have been in development for nearly a decade, though developers have mostly been focused on the rapid charging of heavy-duty commercial vehicles like electric semitrucks and buses. Most superfast charging efforts have focused on these sorts of vehicles for two reasons: They have much bigger battery packs; and they’re mostly operated by businesses and governments in fleets, so the moments they spend charging are moments they’re not transporting people or goods. Their time is money. This makes depot builders more willing to shell out the extra funding needed to get supercharging capabilities. Will they be willing to do the same for passenger vehicles? And at what price?",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Can you imagine a Dell product without the iconic DELL logo blaring back at your face? Well, change is afoot as the PC company continues its journey to make the perfect office monitor. The UltraSharp 32 4K Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3225Q) is another excellent entry in Dell’s elite computer monitor line, and I’ll happily celebrate the subtler branding.\n\nBut is this the best monitor you can buy? Well, it doesn't employ OLED, which is a hot trend right now. But with its “enhanced” IPS (in-plane switching) Black panel, over-the-top connectivity, and classy look, you won’t find a better flagship office monitor.\n\nAn ‘Enhanced’ Dell Monitor\n\nIf you’ve seen a high-end Dell monitor, you’ve seen this one. It’s a 32-inch, 16:9 monitor with a silver back, stand, and base. There are a few things I can appreciate about this one though.\n\nFirst is its relatively thin, black bezels. Most Dell (even UltraSharp) monitors have a strip of plastic as a bottom bezel to house the Dell logo, always staring you in the face. That’s absent here, making for a much cleaner look. It has all the other helpful bits you'd expect, such as a wide range of adjustments, including tilting it to go into a vertical orientation, straightforward cable management built into the stand, and VESA support.\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nBut image quality is what makes it distinct. Dell has been championing “IPS Black” for many years, an LG technology that improves the contrast of IPS panels, a way of competing as an alternative to OLED, which is often more expensive and can cause issues like screen burn-in. For a while, Dell was alone in its IPS Black implementation, but now other companies like BenQ and HP have come along.\n\nThe U3225Q, however, comes with the next-generation IPS Black, which cranks up the contrast even more. How much? Well, from 2,000:1 to 3,000:1. That’s not OLED levels of contrast, but it sure is a massive improvement to the IPS of yesteryear. You won’t be able to hit that contrast ratio at 100 percent brightness, but the U3225Q still manages to get some record-setting contrast for an IPS panel. I didn’t have last year’s U3223QE model on hand to compare side-by-side, but the numbers speak for themselves. This is simply the best IPS panel I’ve ever seen, at least in terms of increasing contrast. The benefit of this is darker, richer looking blacks that don't just look grey. Colors also look a bit more vibrant too.\n\nAs for brightness, the U3225Q manages to crank out up to 417 nits. Anything over 300 nits is considered bright enough for office work, but that extra 150 nits ensures it’ll be bright enough even if your desk gets drowned out by sunlight every afternoon.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, the US astronauts stranded for nine months on the International Space Station, finally made it home on Tuesday, March 18. They returned to Earth with the two members of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission—NASA's Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov of Roscosmos—aboard SpaceX's Dragon Freedom spacecraft.\n\nThe four crew successfully splashed down off the coast of Florida at 5:57 pm EDT. Teams aboard SpaceX recovery craft boarded Dragon Freedom and assisted the crew. The astronauts were then flown to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston to be reunited with their families.\n\nSunita Lyn “Suni” Williams, 59, and Barry Eugene “Butch” Wilmore, 62, lifted off on June 5, 2024, on a mission to test Starliner, a Boeing spacecraft designed to transport crew to and from the ISS and other destinations in low-Earth orbit. The astronauts had not planned to spend more than two weeks in space, but technical issues with Starliner thwarted that plan.\n\nAs it approached the space station, some of Starliner’s thrusters stopped working. Although the Boeing spacecraft managed to dock at the ISS, NASA preferred not to take any risks with its return and opted to send Starliner back to Earth without crew on board. The spacecraft landed safely in September.\n\nWhile Williams and Wilmore’s extended stay in space was unplanned, they had trained for potentially having to stay on the ISS for a number of months. Both also have extensive experience in space expeditions, including previous stays in the ISS.\n\nIn order for the astronauts to return home, NASA decided to send only two astronauts instead of four on the subsequent SpaceX mission. Williams and Wilmore would travel back to Earth in the two vacant seats in the SpaceX vehicle. After some delays, that mission—Crew-9, with Hague and Gorbunov on board—lifted off on September 28, 2024, bound for the ISS.\n\nBut this didn’t mark the end of Williams and Wilmore’s stay on the space station. It was still necessary to wait for the next mission to arrive at the ISS in order to leave the space station with an adequate number of personnel to operate it. So even after Crew-9 had arrived, Williams and Wilmore had to wait for the arrival of Crew-10—which did not happen until March 14—to be free to return to Earth.\n\nWhile the stranded astronauts were prepared for these inconveniences, their condition became a political issue between the administrations of US presidents Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Elon Musk, the owner of SpaceX and a leading figure in the second Trump administration, accused the Biden administration of abandoning the astronauts on the ISS. Shortly after being inaugurated, President Trump asked Musk to return the stranded astronauts as soon as possible.\n\n“PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, thanks to\n\n@ElonMusk, @SpaceX, and @NASA!” the official White House account posted on X on Tuesday after the splashdown.\n\n“We are thrilled to have Suni, Butch, Nick, and Aleksandr home after their monthslong mission conducting vital science, technology demonstrations, and maintenance aboard the International Space Station,” said NASA acting dministrator Janet Petro in a statement. “Per President Trump’s direction, NASA and SpaceX worked diligently to pull the schedule a month earlier. This international crew and our teams on the ground embraced the Trump administration’s challenge of an updated, and somewhat unique, mission plan, to bring our crew home.”\n\nAccording to NASA, Williams and Wilmore traveled 195 million kilometers during their mission, spent 286 days in space, and completed 4,576 orbits around Earth.\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

        "content": "Vladislav Klyushin was having, by any measure, an awful day. The judge in his case had brushed aside his lawyers’ arguments and his friends’ appeals for leniency. She handed down a tough sentence: nine more years in US federal prison, on top of an order to forfeit a fortune, $34 million.\n\nBut if Klyushin was upset about the ruling, he didn’t show it. The then 42-year-old tech executive from Moscow seemed upbeat—quick with a smile on his pinchable cheeks and unerringly polite, just as he had been during his arrest near a Swiss ski resort in March 2021, his months of detention in Switzerland, his extradition to the United States that December, his indictment and trial on hacking and wire fraud charges, and his swift conviction. Klyushin “had a confidence all along that eventually the Russians would get him back,” one of his defense attorneys told me. He seemed certain that his protectors in the Kremlin would spare him from serving out his full sentence.\n\nThere were times when that certainty seemed cocksure. America’s federal prison system held 35 Russian nationals. Surely not all of them were getting traded back. His family and friends were distraught. Within less than a year, though, Klyushin was proven right. On August 1, 2024, he was unshackled and put on a plane back to Moscow—one of the 24 people involved in the largest, most complex US-Russian prisoner exchange ever.\n\nYou probably heard something about the swap. It’s the one that brought Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan home to the United States—and sent back to Russia a Kremlin-linked assassin and a husband-and-wife duo of spies who were so deep undercover that their kids didn’t learn they were Russian until they got on the plane. In coverage of the exchange, Klyushin was treated as a footnote. That was a mistake, if an understandable one. And not just because he was at the center of one of the bigger insider trading cases of all time.\n\nThe escalating conflict between the US and Russia has played out in all sorts of ways over the past decade. One American captive was swapped just two weeks ago; at least 10 more US citizens remain imprisoned in Russia. And now, there’s a Kremlin-friendly occupant of the Oval Office, one who loves to be seen as making deals. One is in global financial markets, with America and its allies walling more and more of Russian industry off from the international economy. There are always creative individuals who can find cracks in that wall, though, and Klyushin sure seems to have been one of them. You don’t have to squint too hard to see his scheme—which ultimately netted $93 million—as a way to bring capital into Russia, despite the global blockade. The contest has also been evident on the streets of Moscow, where a secretive Kremlin security force has grabbed American citizens, who are charged with bogus crimes, and then dangled them in trades for killers, spies, and associates of the Kremlin. It’s kidnapping, hostage taking, and it’s effectively all being done on President Vladimir Putin’s orders. Oftentimes, Americans are taken precisely for their value as assets to be later exchanged—to get back people like that assassin, or this financial crook, Klyushin. He wasn’t at the very top of Moscow’s trade list. But Klyushin was much closer, and more important to the Kremlin, than either side was willing to admit.\n\nIllustration: Vartika Sharma\n\nTo the outside world, Klyushin had a rags-to-riches, fairy-tale life, with a gauzy wedding video to prove it. In a montage later obtained by US prosecutors, Klyushin dives into a country club pool; his bride-to-be, Zhannetta, sips pink champagne on an outdoor bed draped with chiffon and roses; he picks her up in a white Porsche convertible; she’s gorgeous in her backless gown; he’s handsome, if a little goofy, in his tux and subtle mullet; they dance and laugh and stare meaningfully at the fireworks punctuating the perfect night. “I do not know a more decent person than my husband,” Zhannetta later wrote to the judge in his case.\n\nThey had three children, adding to the two Klyushin had from a previous marriage. By all accounts, he was a doting father, a far cry from his own, a man he never met, or his stepfather, who was killed during a car robbery when Klyushin was 14. He emerged from a childhood of poverty to build a number of businesses. First, he was in construction and marketing; later, he ran an IT company called M13, which sold media- and internet-monitoring software to Russian government agencies. Early customers in 2016 included the Ministry of Defense and the office of the presidential administration, where Putin’s propaganda chief became an important proponent of M13. The company’s software was used to keep tabs on hundreds of Telegram channels for a Kremlin worried about the “introduction of unverified or knowingly false information,” according to one local news report.\n\nKlyushin’s rise was rapid, taking in more than $30 million in government contracts in a decade. That confounded some of his professional peers. (“The company and its owner are unknown to most in the IT community,” a respected Russian business journal noted in 2021.) But it brought him influence and admirers. He supported the arts and rebuilt the roof of the monastery on Moscow’s Lubyanka Street, a few blocks down from the headquarters of Russia’s spy service, the FSB. One friend later hailed Klyushin as an “eco-activist” (for planting “several spruces in the yard”) and a “pet-lover” (his “favourite pet is a dog”). “Broad-minded, well-read, educated,” gushed his family friend and tennis coach. An M13 employee said that a conversation with Klyushin “is like getting a lesson from a guru.”",

        "content": "She now felt certain that her third child’s speech and hearing delays had worsened after he started getting vaccines. She reached out to a well-known vaccine skeptic named Mayer Eisenstein. Unlike her own pediatrician, Eisenstein listened sympathetically to her concerns and even gave her his cell phone number. By the time Chany’s fifth child was due to receive shots, she was firm in her convictions. She believed vaccination had caused her children’s disabilities. “I realized it was my mistake,” she says. “And if I made a mistake, I’m going to have to fix it.”\n\nChany decided to create a forum for women in her community. “No one likes to be alone,” she says. “If your child just got a vaccine and now he doesn’t speak anymore, your doctor’s not going to answer that.” Since some Hasidic sects frown on internet use, ultra-­Orthodox women often receive community news, inspirational talks, and other information by way of the phone. Chany worked with others who set up a hotline called Akeres Habayis, or Woman of the House, so that she could use it to share information. “Mothers can feel when something’s wrong with a child,” she told me, “and you should listen to their feelings and not disrespect them.”\n\nViral Relapse In 2000 the US said measles was gone—defeated!—within its borders. Except, not quite. Cases still broke out sporadically. Now the country is in the midst of its worst outbreak in more than 20 years. From January 1 to June 13 of this year, 1,044 people, mostly children, in 28 states have been sickened with the disease. So how was measles declared eliminated, and does the current outbreak mean it’s back for good? The answer is more complicated than you might think. —Megan Molteni What does elimination mean?\n\nThe word elimination sounds absolute. But when it comes to measles, it does not mean the US has zero cases. It means no current strains are native to the US. But the virus can still be carried in from another country. Elimination, a history\n\nIn March 2000, a panel of experts convened by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met to discuss the state of measles. They agreed that the few hundred cases over the previous three years could be attributed mostly to people carrying strains in from other countries. But they disagreed about whether to use the e word. Many worried that such a declaration would instill a false sense of security and unravel a three-decade-long vaccination campaign. In the end, they took the plunge, hoping to set an example. Sixteen years later, the World Health Organization triumphantly declared the Americas—35 countries and 12 territories—the first region to eliminate measles. The rest of the world committed to accomplishing the same goal by 2020. But in an interconnected world, disease elimination is a fragile concept. The first to fall\n\nA country loses its WHO elimination status if a single strain of the measles virus persists for 12 months or longer within its borders. For Venezuela, beset by dire political and economic turmoil, that Rubicon was crossed in July 2017. The next year, as the health system crumbled, a measles epidemic sickened 5,475 people and killed 74. Will the US be next?\n\nThe CDC tracks all measles virus strains that come into the US. Currently, the strain that has circulated the longest is D8, the one that ignited ongoing outbreaks in Brooklyn and Rockland County, New York. It has been spreading since September 2018, which means health authorities have just a few months to halt transmissions before measles would be considered officially reestab­lished. If the US loses its elimination status, it won’t be due to economic chaos or a lack of resources; it will be because viral misinformation proved harder to contain than the virus itself.\n\nThis sense of being disrespected and dismissed by doctors fueled Chany’s distrust of vaccines, but her suspicion of medical authorities may have had deeper roots. Two of her grandparents were survivors of Auschwitz. The other two lived in Romania under communist rule, where they were subjected to physical violence, before coming to Brooklyn in the 1960s. Torture, medical experimentation, and death by government edict seemed an inescapable part of Chany’s inheritance, and it was one she shared with members of her community. She viewed efforts by secular health departments to mandate vaccination as a threatening intrusion on private life.\n\nChany began to host conference calls, later posted on Akeres Habayis. She began inviting guest speakers, including well-known vaccine skeptics. One of her first guests was Mayer Eisenstein, and 47 people called in. Some of the most popular calls drew several hundred women to live conversations, with a thousand or more dialing in later to listen to the recordings. Chany got to know a wide range of antivaxxers who had risen to prominence on the internet but had not yet found a foothold among the ultra-Orthodox. The hotline made her a powerful conduit of misinformation into a world that often shunned outsiders.\n\nAs Chany cultivated ties with other like-minded ­people in her community, she came up with an informal name for the network: Peach (Parents Educating and Advocating for Children’s Health). “It was just a name,” she says. “It was a way to identify people who were in the same situation.” Around 2012 or 2013, a man named Moishe Kahan reached out to her about collaborating. Kahan lived in Williamsburg, another Brooklyn neighborhood with a large ultra-­Orthodox community. Kahan had grown up in London and hadn’t had vaccines as a child. Over time he became fiercely resistant to the very idea of them. Kahan developed a presence on Facebook, promoting conspiracy theories from sources like Infowars. He also became an independent distributor for a company called Immunotec, which sells dietary supplements and has funded research on the use of its products for children with autism. (Kahan did not respond to emails requesting comment.)\n\nChany and Kahan joined forces. In 2014, Peach released a pamphlet called “The Vaccine Safety Handbook: An Informed Parent’s Guide,” listing Kahan as a contributing researcher. It was paid for by advertisements from local businesses and was filled with tales ostensibly linking vaccines to autism, SIDS, allergies, asthma, and cancer. A series of illustrations shows mothers struggling to communicate with arrogant doctors. “Doctor, my child became autistic/epileptic/anaphylactic after his vaccines,” says one woman, cradling an infant in her arms. “Obviously your child was defective. Vaccines are perfect,” the doctor replies. “How many ‘defective’ children would have remained perfectly healthy if not for vaccines?” asks the caption.\n\nIn another illustration, a woman stands with her arm around a small boy. “My son regressed into autism after his MMR vaccine. Now he’s in his own world and can’t communicate,” she says. “But at least we had no problem enrolling him in school.”\n\nThe tone of bitterness and regret in the handbook mirrored Chany’s feelings. So, too, did the call to mothers to feel empowered. There was an email address people could write to, and Chany would respond. The pamphlet also provided the number for a “Peach Hotline,” which connected callers to Akeres Habayis. Through the hotline they solicited volunteers, and Chany told those who contacted her how to distribute the pamphlet in their neighborhoods. “It’s a grassroots movement,” she says. “It’s literally person to person.”\n\nMeasles is “literally all over the street,” says Dov Landa, a physician assistant in Williamsburg. Photograph: Natalie Keyssar\n\nIn early 2014, an ultra-Orthodox woman named Zahava, who lives in Williamsburg, found a copy of the Peach pamphlet on her doorstep. For more than 70 years, Williamsburg has been home to Hasidic Jews, many descended from Eastern Europeans who settled there after surviving the Holocaust. Hasidim tend to live in close communities, living by tenets set forth in Jewish texts. Zahava, who agreed to speak as long as her full name wasn’t used, is devout and lives in a large apartment building, where children play together and extended families gather for meals. Others in her building received the Peach pamphlet too, and friends and neighbors pored over the sensational claims, especially those about autism.\n\nRoughly 40,000 copies of the pamphlet appeared in kosher grocery stores and by apartment doors in Williamsburg and Borough Park, as well as in ultra-­Orthodox communities in upstate New York and New Jersey. Zahava, who has delicate features, pale skin, and light eyes, read the pamphlet just months after giving birth to her first son. She felt terrified. The pamphlet played on the anxiety that she and other new parents often feel about bringing babies into a world of pesticides, plastics, and pollutants, and it seemed to offer a simple explanation for virtually any physical or developmental anomaly. “It doesn’t take much to put fear into a mother,” Zahava says. “And once the fear is there, it is very hard to get out of it and go to the logic.”\n\nZahava did her shopping at an upscale kosher market and had the groceries delivered to her home. One day, inside her order was another copy of the pamphlet. It came again with subsequent food deliveries, filling her with dread about vaccinating her infant son. Each time she took her boy for a checkup or sick visit, she bombarded Dov Landa, the physician assistant who treated her child, with questions. She felt reassured by his well-­informed answers and his concern for her son, but the self-doubt would creep back in.\n\nOne day at the grocery store, Zahava saw a pile of the pamphlets and felt her distress well up again. After asking the cashier if she could have them, she walked out with the stack and dropped it into the nearest trash can. Eventually, after her husband consulted with a rabbi, who assured them that the shots were safe, Zahava brought her son to Landa for his vaccinations.",

A shocking mini-series, this isn't a whodunit, but a whydunit. Its four episodes—each masterfully shot in a single real-time take—explore how boys are radicalized online to hate women, and the horrifying effects it has. The powerhouse cast includes cocreator and writer Stephen Graham (Bodies, A Thousand Blows) as Jamie's father Eddie, Ashley Walters (Bulletproof) as Detective Boscombe, the arresting officer and investigator of Jamie's crime, and Erin Doherty (The Crown) as the psychologist evaluating Jamie. Each brings this incredibly difficult material to life, but it's newcomer Owen Cooper as Jamie who most astounds, turning from petrified to cheeky to vitriolic in a terrifying heartbeat. Adolescence is harrowing but important viewing.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nOriginally released on Paramount+, the latest outing for the Ninja Turtles finds Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello in uncharted territory—openly renowned heroes, cheered on by the people of New York after saving the city during the Mutant Mayhem movie reboot. With the brothers balancing battling evil mutants and shady government agents with learning how to fit in with new friends and allies, it's also the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show to really emphasize the “Teenage” part of the equation. While Tales doesn't replicate the CGI style of the film, its 2D animation feels like a love letter to the heroes-in-a-half-shell's comic book origins, and with arch-nemesis Shredder only teased at the end of Mutant Mayhem, the series is free to explore new and lesser-known enemies from the source material. The result? A fresh take on the Turtles that's as fun for longtime shellheads as it is for new fans.\n\nToxic Town\n\nBased on the real-world Corby toxic waste case, this four-part drama follows the decades-long battle for justice faced by the former steelworking English town, after widespread industrial pollution led to multiple children being born with physical disabilities. Centered largely on the lives of mothers Susan McIntyre (former Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker), Tracey Taylor (Aimee Lou Wood), and Maggie Mahon (Claudia Jessie), Toxic Town fiercely explores how far the community had to go for justice and how low the people responsible would stoop to avoid culpability. A searing, powerful, heart-wrenching drama that will—and should—leave you absolutely furious at corporate greed.\n\nPantheon\n\nOriginally an AMC+ show, both seasons of Pantheon are now available on Netflix. Good timing too, since its nightmarish scenario of digitally uploaded human consciousnesses and exploration of the impact such technology would have on society feels worryingly prescient. With plot threads weaving between isolated Maddie Kim, whose dead father may have been reborn as an “Uploaded Intelligence,” Caspian Keyes, a genius teenager whose entire life is a Truman Show–style lie, and Vinod Chanda, an engineer investigating UI, this hard sci-fi outing—based on the short fiction of Ken Liu—offers a dark examination of virtual immortality. A uniquely brilliant adult animated series.\n\nZero Day\n\nCards on the table: A significant part of the appeal here is seeing the iconic Robert De Niro in his first major English-language TV role (he previously appeared in the Argentinian Nada, aka Nothing). He doesn't disappoint with his performance as former US president George Mullen—pulled out of retirement to oversee a commission investigating a colossal cyberattack that left thousands of Americans dead and the terrifying warning that \"this will happen again\"—commanding the screen with his trademark gravitas. Director Lesli Linka Glatter wrings great drama from the whodunit of it all (Russians? hackers? hedge fund bros?), but with Mullen handed unprecedented powers to track down the culprits, the real nail-biting moments come from its suddenly timely explorations of abuses of power. With a powerhouse cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lizzy Caplan, and Jesse Plemons, Zero Day is an engaging political thriller, and at six episodes it makes for a great binge-watch.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar\n\nInfluencers have been known to hawk nonsense diets and spurious “wellness” regimens, but few have ever done it like Belle Gibson, the real-life Australian influencer who went as far as faking brain cancer for attention. And while she hailed alternative diets and whole foods for keeping her nonexistent illness at bay—launching an app and cookbook in the process—actual cancer sufferers paid the price for her extreme narcissism and greed. This dramatized limited series—“a true-ish story … based on a lie,” as Netflix puts it—makes for uncomfortably gripping viewing as it charts the rise and fall of Gibson (Kaitlyn Dever, with a flawless Aussie accent) and her rivalry with Milla Blake (Alycia Debnam-Cary), a fellow influencer and actual cancer patient. Better than doomscrolling reels on Instagram or TikTok, and a reminder that everyone should be a lot more skeptical of anything influencers are shilling on social media.\n\nThe Night Agent\n\nSpecial agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) is back, and the stakes have never been higher. While the first season of The Night Agent wove a compelling spy drama out of the idea of a mole at the heart of America's intelligence services, the newly arrived second season takes a more global approach—Sutherland hunts down a stolen chemical weapon project, drawing him back into the orbit of tech savant and sometime love interest Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), while Iranian diplomatic aide Noor Taheri (Arienne Mandi) offers secrets to the CIA in return for asylum, and a deposed Eastern European dictator aims to manipulate everything from behind bars. Sure, the show’s mix of politics and spook work won’t surprise genre diehards, but it weaves together its many influences—and many more plot threads—into a supremely entertaining thriller.\n\nAsura\n\nThe four Takezawa sisters are close but have little in common. Eldest Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is already a widow; repressed Takiko (Yû Aoi) and rebellious Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) are always at each other's throats; and second-born Makiko (Machiko Ono) tries to balance keeping the peace with being a housewife and mother to her own two children. Yet when Takiko learns that their father Kotaro (Jun Kunimura) may have a second, secret, family, the sisters’ bonds are put to the test as they struggle to uncover the truth. Asura is far more than a turgid family drama—it's equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, capturing the complexities of the relationships between its quartet of protagonists. Keeping the 1970s setting of Kuniko Mukōda’s original novel allows Palme d’Or– winning director Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters) to craft a gorgeously shot period piece that still feels incredibly timely and modern.\n\nCastlevania: Nocturne\n\nIn the midst of the French Revolution, citizens rise up against a parasitic ruling class—but vampire hunter Richter Belmont and his magic-wielding allies Maria and Annette are more concerned with what's literally bleeding the people dry. The first season of this grisly adult animated series saw the team coming together to face the rise of a \"Vampire Messiah\" prophesied to devour the sun, but the new second season ratchets up the action as the heroes team with Alucard, son of Dracula, to try to restore light to the world. Let's just say the stakes (sorry) have never been higher. While Nocturne's second season has some closer links to the previous Castlevania animated series, it still works perfectly well on its own, delivering high quality animation, brilliant action, and a fantastic cast of characters to sink your teeth into (sorry, again).\n\nSakamoto Days\n\nTaro Sakamoto used to be the worst of the worst, a hit man par excellence, his lethal skills making him a legendary figure in the criminal underworld. Then he fell in love, got married, and retired to run a convenience store with his wife Aoi and their daughter Hana. Unfortunately, he didn't exactly leave his old job on the best of terms, and now a cadre of killers are out for the billion yen bounty on his head. Luckily, Sakamoto's lost none of his skills—even though he has let himself go in other areas—but can he protect his family without breaking Aoi's strict “no killing” rule? Based on the manga by Yuto Suzuki, this comedy-action anime is a blast, and with a new episode each Saturday rather than Netflix's usual drop-it-all-at-once model, it's appointment viewing you won't want to miss.\n\nJentry Chau vs the Underworld\n\nYou know the drill—everyday teenager learns she has superpowers and is destined to fight the forces of darkness. Except Jentry Chau (voiced by Ali Wong) is not like any other teenage girl—she’s known about the supernatural her whole life (her uncontrollable fire powers were a giveaway) and spent a lifetime avoiding it. Sent to study in Korea for her own safety, Jentry is drawn back into the mystic world after being attacked in Seoul by a jiangshi named Ed (Bowen Yang). Brought back to her home in Texas by her great-aunt, Jentry has to survive not only the formidable mogui Mr. Cheng, who intends to drain her soul and powers, but the horrors of high school, culture shock, and the pain of her own past. Taking the “high school is hell” metaphor of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, adding a dash of Gravity Falls’ mystery, and rooting it all in Asian mythology, Jentry Chau vs the Underworld is one of Netflix’s freshest animated shows in years.\n\nSquid Game\n\nProduced in Korea, Squid Game blends Hunger Games and Parasite with a battle-royal-style contest. Hundreds of desperate, broke people are recruited to a contest where they can win enough money to never need to worry about their debts again. All they have to do to win the ₩45.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot is complete six children’s games. But it’s not that simple: All the games have a twist, and very few people make it out alive. Squid Game is intense, brutal, and often very graphic, but it is also completely gripping. After the show became a cultural phenomenon in 2021, fans waited what felt like an eternity for another season. That second season finally dropped on December 26.\n\nQueer Eye\n\nA reformatted Fab Five return, ready to change the lives of 10 new heroes. Relocating to Las Vegas, the ninth season of Queer Eye sees Karamo, Tan, Antoni, Jonathan, and new host Jeremiah Brent—taking Bobby Berk's seat as the design whiz—helping a retired showgirl regain her sparkle, organizing a dream wedding for new parents, and, in possibly their strangest case yet, teaching a magic dragon to shed his scaly exterior. No, really. Netflix's most feel-good show.\n\nNo Good Deed\n\nTake Selling Sunset and add a grisly tragicomic twist and you just about have No Good Deed. A dark comedy from Liz Feldman, creator of Dead to Me, this eight-part series starts with Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano) putting their gorgeous home on the market, and descends into darker territory as prospective buyers go to ever more desperate attempts to get their hands on the house, nosy neighbors interfere, and the grisly history of the house itself threatens to come to light. Buoyed by a stellar cast including Teyonah Parris, Abbi Jacobson, Luke Wilson, and Denis Leary, this is a glossy, witty, and possibly only slightly exaggerated take on the brutality of the Los Angeles property market.\n\nA Man on the Inside\n\nThe latest show from comedy mastermind Michael Schur (The Good Place, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine), A Man on the Inside features Ted Danson as Charles Nieuwendyk, a retired engineering professor who's lost all direction since his wife passed. But when private investigator Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) needs a man of his demographic to go undercover in a retirement community to investigate allegations of resident abuse, Charles may find an unlikely new lease on life—if he can figure out how to use his smartphone, that is. Reflecting on end-of-life realities as much as it plays up Charles' fish-out-of-water situation, it's a show that's equal parts poignant, melancholic, and achingly funny—and it's based on a true story, to boot.\n\nBlack Doves\n\nHelen Webb (Keira Knightley) is wife to the UK defense secretary, mother to two children, and bored with her picture-perfect life. Spectacular cover then, since she's actually a spy for the mercenary organization Black Doves, selling state secrets to the highest bidder. But when her real love Jason (Andrew Koji) is killed, Helen is determined to find out who killed him and why—and her pursuit of the truth threatens both her public and private lives. Paired with assassin and old friend Sam (Ben Whishaw, in a very different spy role to his turn in the James Bond films) at the behest of stern operator Mrs. Reed (Sarah Lancashire), Helen's obsession could have led to a dour, gritty thriller, but Black Doves bucks the grim-dark trend to serve up a pulpy, colorful outing with enough heart to balance its violence. At only six episodes (with a second season already confirmed), it's a brisk watch too.\n\nArcane\n\nAnimated series based on video games can run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. Yet Arcane stood out by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between is entirely accessible. The second and final season, released in a trio of movie-length blocks of three episodes apiece, escalates the conflict between the warring factions but never loses its central focus on the fractured relationship between sisters. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane is one of the best animated series in years—and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it.\n\nCobra Kai\n\nPicking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence’s iconic fight at the end of the first Karate Kid movie, Cobra Kai initially follows a washed-up Johnny as he reopens the Cobra Kai karate dojo, finding new purpose after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridueña, Blue Beetle) in a fight. Over the course of six seasons, the stakes get higher—and frankly, increasingly, gloriously, ludicrous—as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California. Alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity, and everything gears toward a global battle for karate supremacy. It’s all a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks, but thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, it’s a retro-styled delight.\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nIf there's a West Wing-shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat—a tense geopolitical thriller elevated by a superb central performance by The Americans' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate's role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis while also navigating her fraying \"special relationship\" with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell). The second season picks up from a literally explosive cliffhanger and propels Kate into a political conspiracy—and a potential promotion to vice president. Some of the twists along the way are faintly ridiculous, but The Diplomat has become one of Netflix's biggest hits in recent years, and a third season is already in the works.\n\nNobody Wants This\n\nStop us if you've heard this one before: An agnostic sex podcaster and a Rabbi walk into a party … OK, it's not quite a setup for a joke, but rather for a sharp romcom—one based, in exaggerated form, on creator Erin Foster's own experiences. Joanne (Kristen Bell, The Good Place) is cynical and burned out on modern dating, even as it provides her material for the increasingly successful podcast she hosts with her sister Morgan (Justine Lupe). When she meets young, handsome Noah (Adam Brody, The OC), the attraction is instant and mutual—except he's just broken up with the stereotypical Nice Jewish Girl™ his family expected him to settle down with. Yet as the pair swirl through each other's lives, the show proves it's less about culture clash than it is exploring what the seemingly mismatched pair are willing to change and sacrifice to make their burgeoning relationship work. With sizzling chemistry between its leads, Nobody Wants This is a romcom with an emphasis on the romance.\n\nHeartstopper\n\nOne of the most joyful shows on Netflix returns for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt queer romance. In the long-awaited third season, things heat up between the central couple, with Charlie (Joe Locke) preparing to say three little words to Nick (Kit Connor) for the first time, while Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao (William Gao) try to have the perfect romantic summer before Elle starts art college. Heartstopper's return also sheds some of its earlier cloying tendencies, growing up alongside its talented young cast and giving them more serious material to work with, tackling more mature themes of sex, eating disorders, and gender dysphoria—all without losing the warmth and charm that made audiences fall in love with the show in the first place. The show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and one that everyone needs to watch, whatever their sexuality.\n\nBaby Reindeer\n\nStalking is no laughing matter, which makes this dramatized—and highly controversial—retelling of Scottish comedian Richard Gadd's own real-life experiences more than a little uncomfortable. Adapted from Gadd's one-man stage show of the same name, Baby Reindeer follows Donny (Gadd, playing a fictionalized version of himself) after he meets Martha (Jessica Gunning) at the pub he works at. Despite claiming to be a lawyer, Martha can't afford a drink—and a sympathetic gesture on Donny's part opens the door to increasingly obsessive and dangerous behavior as she proceeds to infiltrate his life. It's shockingly honest and self-aware in places—does Donny, and by extension Gadd, on some level relish the attention of his stalker? Are his occasional moments of kindness and warmth toward Martha inviting her further in? Is he using her, finding her a strange source of material for his stand-up career? A fiercely paced seven episodes, shot more like a horror movie, this Emmy-winning miniseries explores trauma and intimacy, shame and masculinity, and how society often silences the victims of abuse.\n\nThe Boyfriend\n\n\"Anyone can fall in love with anyone\" is the opening narration to The Boyfriend, Japan's first same-sex dating show—a bold and progressive statement that reflects the shifting tide of opinion in the country. Throwing nine single men together in an idyllic beach house for a summer and charging them with running a coffee truck, the over-arching concept is to see who'll pair up, but the series is as interested in exploring the friendships that emerge between the cast as it is the romantic relationships. Unlike Western dating shows, there are no scandals, no dramatic twists, no betrayals, and the “challenges” are adorably focused on confessing feelings. The gentleness of it all adds an almost relaxing quality, with the men discussing their emotions—and the nature of being queer in Japan—earnestly. An absolutely joyful example of reality TV.\n\nKleo\n\nIf you’re pining for more Killing Eve, then this German thriller may be the next best thing. Set in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the series follows the eponymous Kleo (Jella Haase), a Stasi assassin imprisoned by her agency on false treason charges. Released after the fall of the Berlin Wall, she seeks revenge on her former handlers—but West German detective Sven (Dimitrij Schaad), the only witness to her last kill, may have something to say about that. As dark and violent as you'd expect given the period and the themes of betrayal and vengeance, Kleo is lightened by its oft-deranged sense of humor and a charismatic lead duo who brilliantly bounce off one another—chemistry that's only heightened in the second season as Kleo's pursuit of her old allies intensifies, attracting attention from international spy agencies in the aftermath of the Cold War.\n\nSweet Home\n\nBased on the Korean webcomic by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home offers a very different vision of apocalyptic end times—rather than pandemics, disasters, or even zombies, this posits an end of the world brought about by people's transformation into grotesque monsters, each unique and seemingly based on their deepest desires when they were human. The first season is a masterclass in claustrophobic horror, as the residents of an isolated, run-down apartment building—chiefly suicidal teen Cha Hyun-su (Song Kang), former firefighter Seo Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young), and Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook), who may be a brutal gangster—battle for survival. The second and third seasons explore what remains of the wider world, delving into the true nature of both monster and man—and if there's any hope for what remains of humanity. With phenomenal effects work blending prosthetics, CGI, and even stop-motion animation for some disturbingly juddering creatures, this stands apart from the horror crowd.\n\nStar Trek Prodigy\n\nParamount+'s loss remains Netflix's gain, as the streamer's license rescue of this great Star Trek spin-off warps into its second season. After escaping a distant prison planet and becoming Starfleet cadets under the watchful eye of Star Trek Voyager's Admiral Janeway (voiced by the venerable Kate Mulgrew), the ragtag crew—led by aspiring captain Dal R'El and bolstered by astrolinguist Gwyndala, engineer Jankom Pog, energy being Zero, scientist Rok-Tahk, and indestructible, gelatinous Murf—find themselves cast through time on the most dangerous mission of their young lives. While aimed at younger audiences and intended as an intro to the wider Trek universe and its ethics, Prodigy packs in plenty for older Trekkers to appreciate, particularly with a slate of returning Star Trek legends voiced by their original actors. Prodigy is something of a sleeper hit, but one of the best Trek shows in years.\n\nSupacell\n\nOne by one, five Black Londoners awaken to strange superpowers. Struggling father Andre (Eric Kofi-Abrefa) develops superstrength, nurse Sabrina (Nadine Mills) unleashes phenomenal telekinetic might, drug dealer Rodney (Calvin Demba) races at superspeed, and wannabe gang leader Tazer (Josh Tedeku) turns invisible. But it's Michael (Tosin Cole, Doctor Who) who may be the most pivotal, realizing he can leap through time and space and learning he only has three months to save his fiancée's life. Created by Andrew “Rapman” Onwubolu, Supacell is a show about superpowers, but not necessarily superheroes, with its fantastic cast offering up a far more realistic and human exploration of now-familiar ideas than anything you'll find in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And the mystery of why—and how—only Black people seem to be gaining powers builds up to a more powerful punch than an Asgardian god of thunder. A smart, modern, and refreshing take on the genre.\n\nThe Good Place\n\nAfter suffering an improbable and humiliating death, Eleanor (Kristen Bell) finds herself in “The Good Place,” a perfect neighborhood inhabited by the world's worthiest people. The only problem? She's not meant to be there. Desperate to not be sent to “The Bad Place,” she tries to correct her behavior in the afterlife, with the help of her assigned soulmate, philosophy professor Chidi (William Jackson Harper). A twist at the end of the first season remains one of the best ever, while the show's ability to sprinkle ethical and philosophical precepts into a sitcom format is frankly astounding. With a sensational cast rounded out by Manny Jacinto, Jameela Jamil, D'Arcy Carden, and Ted Danson, The Good Place more than earns its place in the good place of TV history.\n\nBridgerton\n\nStill ranking as one of Netflix’s most-watched series ever, Bridgerton is set during the Regency period in England and follows the powerful Bridgerton family as they navigate love, marriage, and scandal—with most of the latter stirred up by the gossip columns penned by the anonymous Lady Whistledown. Created for screen by Chris Van Dusen and executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, this incredibly bingeable and shockingly entertaining show is based on a series of novels by Julia Quinn, with each season focusing on a different branch of the Bridgerton tree. The third and latest season sees the spotlight fall on the long-simmering relationship between wallflower Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), a pairing that threatens to reveal powerful secrets that have been bubbling away since the very first episode.\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nIn 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world—and humanity’s continued existence may rely on there being no “game over.” Game of Thrones’ creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu’s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza González, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga.\n\nRipley\n\nPerhaps best known nowadays from 1999’s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith’s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman’s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle—and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\n\nA talented young cast bring to life the tale of Aang (Gordon Cormier), the latest in a long line of avatars who can control all four cardinal elements, but is frozen in time for a century when his world needed him most. Awakened by new friends Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), he sets about continuing his training as the Avatar in an attempt to restore balance, all the while pursued by the relentless Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu), heir to the imperialist Fire Nation that has conquered the world. Consider this a cautious recommendation—the original animated version, also on Netflix, remains superior—but Netflix's live action Avatar remake serves up scale and spectacle, without betraying the heart of the classic show. It's also already confirmed for two more seasons, so viewers can look forward to the complete saga without the now-familiar Netflix cancellation worries.\n\nThe Legend of Korra\n\nIf you're still not sold on the live-action Avatar, this sequel to the original series is well worth your time. Set 70 years after the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra explores how Aang's world has progressed after decades of relative peace. When Korra, the new Avatar, moves to Republic City to complete her training under the tutelage of Tenzin—Aang's son, now with a family of his own—she finds herself and new friends Mako and Bolin caught in the growing tensions between element benders and the Equalist movement, who claim the unpowered are an oppressed class. As the series progresses over its four seasons, The Legend of Korra proves itself a very different beast than its predecessor, exploring political themes and social prejudices in deeper—and often darker—detail, while also expanding the more fantastic elements of the universe and revealing the origins of the first Avatar. Even more brilliantly animated, and with a unique 1920s inspired aesthetic, Korra is a show that grew up alongside its audience, and is all the stronger for it.\n\nBeef\n\nEver been cut off in traffic? Ever had it happen when you’re having a really bad day? Ever just wanted to take the low road, chase the person down and make them pay?! Then—after a few deep breaths—Beef is the show for you. It's a pressure valve for every petty grievance you’ve ever suffered, following rich Amy (Ali Wong) and struggling Danny (Steven Yeun) as they escalate a road rage encounter into a vengeance-fueled quest to destroy the other. Yet Beef is more than a city-wide revenge thriller—it's a biting look at how crushing modern life can be, particularly in its LA setting, where extravagant wealth brushes up against inescapable poverty and seemingly no one is truly happy. Part dramedy, part therapy, Beef is a bad example of conflict resolution but a cathartic binge watch that clearly resonates—as evidenced by its growing clutch of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Limited Series.\n\nLoudermilk\n\nSomething of a sleeper hit for years—its first two seasons debuted on AT&T's now-defunct pay TV channel Audience in 2017, before its third season appeared over on Amazon—all three seasons of this bleak comedy are now available on Netflix. Ron Livingston stars as Sam Loudermilk, a vitriolic former music critic and recovering alcoholic who proves almost pathologically incapable of holding his tongue when faced with life's small frustrations—a personality type possibly ill-suited to leading others through addiction support groups. It's dark in places, and its central character is deliberately unlikeable, but smart writing and smarter performances shape this into something of an acerbic anti-Frasier.\n\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off\n\nAdapted from the beloved graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, animated by one of the most exciting and dynamic studios in Japan, and voiced by the entire returning cast of director Edgar Wright's 2010 live-action adaption, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would have been cult gold even if it was a straight retelling of its eponymous slacker's battles against lover Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes. Yet somehow, in a world devoid of surprises, this packs in killer twists from the very first episode, making for a show that's as fresh and exciting as ever. Saying anything else would ruin it—just watch.\n\nPluto\n\nThink you know Astro Boy? Think again. In 2003, Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 20th Century Boys) updated original creator Osamu Tezuka's hugely influential \"The Greatest Robot on Earth\" story arc for his manga Pluto, opting for a more adult approach. The focus shifts from the heroic boy robot to grizzled cybernetic detective Gesicht as he investigates a series of murders of both humans and robots, each victim left with makeshift horns crammed into their heads. Meanwhile, Atom (Astro's Japanese name) is recast as a former peace ambassador, effectively a propaganda tool rolled out at the end of the 39th Central Asian War, still dealing with trauma from the experience. This adaptation is not only a faithful recreation of Urasawa's retelling, but is stunningly animated to a standard rarely seen in Netflix's original anime productions. With eight episodes, each around an hour long, this is as prestigious as any live-action thriller the streamer has produced, and a testament to both Tezuka and Urasawa's respective geniuses.\n\nBlue Eye Samurai\n\nIn the 17th Century, Japan enforced its \"sakoku\" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between—so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated—which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic—and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.\n\nPending Train\n\nNetflix: License one of Japan’s best SF dramas in years. Also Netflix: Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer. Which is where WIRED comes in—Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn’t sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers’ first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group—including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae—begins to realize that there may be a reason they’ve been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, Pending Train offers a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go.\n\nOne Piece\n\nMark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from “awful” to “not too bad,” Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans’ fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda’s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast Iñaki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season—including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)—all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.\n\nThe Chosen One\n\nBased on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life—and potentially the world—changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix's expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There's an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there's another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader—also worth a watch, but don't get them confused!)\n\nAlice in Borderland\n\nWhen slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) is mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills give him an edge navigating a series of lethal games that test intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after barely scraping through several rounds, Arisu is no closer to uncovering the secrets of this strange borderland, or to finding a way home—and the stakes are about to get even higher. Not only are Arisu and his allies Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), Kuina (Aya Asahina), and Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) faced with another gauntlet of sadistic games, but they find themselves caught between rival card suit “courts” vying for power—and not everyone can be trusted.\n\nWith its willingness to kill off main characters at a moment’s notice, the first season of this gripping adaptation of Haro Aso’s manga kept viewers on tenterhooks throughout. As the long-awaited second season leans further into its twisted Alice in Wonderland imagery, expect more shocking developments in this taut thriller.\n\nRussian Doll\n\nIn Russian Doll, Nadia has one very big problem: Time keeps breaking around her. Season one finds Nadia—played by Natasha Lyonne, who is also a cocreator on the show—dying at her own birthday party, only to wake up there over and over again, trapped in a Groundhog Day-style loop until she can unravel her personalized knot in the space-time continuum. Things only get stranger in season two, where Nadia finds herself traveling back in time to 1982 and inhabiting the body of her own mother—currently heavily pregnant with Nadia herself. Both seasons are funny and thought-provoking, reflecting on personal and generational trauma, all without overegging the potential for philosophical musing.\n\nLupin\n\nArsène Lupin, the belle epoque burglar created by French novelist Maurice Leblanc in the early 1900s, is reinvented as Assane Diop, a first-generation Frenchman with a mania for Lupin books and a grudge against the powerful forces who decades ago framed his father for a theft he didn’t commit—and led him to die in prison. Pairing drones, social media bots, and hacking skills with traditional tools of the trade like fake beards, picklocks, and quick wits, Diop hunts down his adversaries as he searches for the truth about his father’s fate. In his spare time, Diop also tries to patch together a crumbling marriage and build a better rapport with his son. Worth watching in the French original, this five-episode series’ strength lies in the dialog, the character development, and the charismatic performance of Omar Sy as Assane. The actual escapades and daring heists are beautifully choreographed, but a lot of the mechanics—how a certain piece of legerdemain worked, when an impenetrable building was infiltrated—are left to the viewer's imagination.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Over the past decade, encrypted communication has become the norm for billions of people. Every day, Signal, iMessage, and WhatsApp keep billions of messages, photos, videos, and calls private by using end-to-end encryption by default—while Zoom, Discord, and various other services all have options to enable the protection. But despite the technology’s mainstream rise, long-standing threats to weaken encryption keep piling up.\n\nOver the past few months, there has been a surge in government and law enforcement efforts that would effectively undermine encryption, privacy advocates and experts say, with some of the emerging threats being the most “blunt” and aggressive of those in recent memory. Officials in the UK, France, and Sweden have all made moves since the start of 2025 that could undermine or eliminate the protections of end-to-end encryption, adding to a multiyear European Union plan to scan private chats and Indian efforts that could damage encryption.\n\nThese latest assaults on encryption come as intelligence agencies and law enforcement officials in the United States have recently backtracked on years of anti-encryption attitudes and now recommend that people use encrypted communication platforms whenever they can. The drastic shift in attitude followed the China-backed Salt Typhoon hacker group’s widespread breach of major US telecoms, and it comes as the second Trump administration ramps up potential surveillance of millions of undocumented migrants living in the US. Simultaneously, the administration has been straining longtime, crucial international intelligence-sharing agreements and partnerships.\n\n“The trend is bleak,” says Carmela Troncoso, a longtime privacy and cryptography researcher and the scientific director at the Max-Planck Institute for Security and Privacy in Germany. “We see these new policies coming up as mushrooms trying to undermine encryption.”\n\nEnd-to-end encryption is designed so only the sender and receiver of messages have access to their contents—governments, tech companies, and telecom providers can’t snoop on what people are saying. Those privacy and security guarantees have made encryption a target for law enforcement and governments for decades, because officials claim that the protection makes it prohibitively difficult to investigate urgent threats such as child sexual abuse material and terrorism.\n\nAs a result, governments around the world have frequently proposed technical mechanisms to bypass encryption and allow access to messages for investigations. Cryptographers and technologists have repeatedly and definitively warned, though, that any backdoor created to access end-to-end encrypted communications could be exploited by hackers or authoritarian governments, compromising everyone’s safety. Additionally, it is likely that criminals would find ways to continue to use self-made encryption tools to conceal their messages, meaning that backdoors in mainstream products would succeed at undermining protections for the public without eliminating its use by bad actors.\n\nBroadly, the recent threats to encryption have come in three forms, says Namrata Maheshwari, the encryption policy lead at international nonprofit Access Now. First, there are those where governments or law enforcement agencies are asking for backdoors to be built into encrypted platforms to gain “lawful access” to content. At the end of February, for example, Apple pulled its encrypted iCloud backup system, called Advanced Data Protection, from use in the UK after the country’s lawmakers reportedly hit the Cupertino company with a secret order demanding Apple provide access to encrypted files. To do so, Apple would have had to create a backdoor. The order, which has been criticized by the Trump administration, is set to be challenged in a secret court hearing on March 14.",

        "content": "On a Friday afternoon in mid-March, a bunch of (presumably) non-hackers showed up to participate in a new kind of “hackathon.” It was Pi Day, so pie was served, but the mood wasn’t celebratory. Students, researchers, and members of the wider public health community were there, in a lecture hall at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and on Zoom, to rescue data. Whatever they could. According to the flier for the Preserving Public Health Data Hackathon, the current Trump administration was trying to undermine research on everything from climate change to systemic racism, and saving data from government websites meant it would be archived and republished in the event federal agencies tried to remove it. The antiauthoritarian theme came up often: don’t obey in advance.\n\nEveryone in the room and on the Zoom got a crash course in identifying at-risk information, collecting it, and storing it once they did. Backing up certain pieces seemed critical.\n\nFor those who work in public health, protecting research pertaining to gender identity and diversity issues has been a focus since the inauguration. Last year, then-candidate Trump repeated a lot of anti-trans rhetoric on the campaign trail, and in the first weeks of his presidency signed executive orders essentially barring transgender people from serving in the military, proclaiming that the US government would only recognize “two genders, male and female,” threatening to withhold federal funds in what is an attempt to bar trans women from sports, and attempting to block gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19. Since Trump’s inauguration, hundreds of words—from “transgender” to “Latinx” to “accessible”—have been removed from federal agencies’ websites. In early February, thousands of websites went missing as agencies raced to comply with the executive orders.\n\nIn recent weeks, the targeting of gender-related material has become even starker, after Trump told a joint session of Congress that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had uncovered that the federal government had spent $8 million on “making mice transgender” (it hasn’t), and the Department of Defense performed a purge of “DEI” materials that included flagging, but ultimately not removing, images of the Enola Gay.\n\nOne particular dataset, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (commonly shortened to YRBS), seems particularly at-risk, notes Ariel Beccia, an epidemiologist at the Chan School’s LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence. The YRBS, which tracks scores of health-related issues in young people, is one of the only nationally representative surveys that regularly collects data on transgender kids. Beccia and other public health researchers fear the information in the YRBS may not be available forever.\n\nAnd even if the YRBS can be backed up, the integrity of its data can’t be completely protected from the influence of the new administration. President Trump’s recent moves have also left some in public service afraid to participate in new research, like this year’s survey. “Because of this ‘comply in advance’ strategy, school boards are hesitant to participate in the YRBS,” Beccia told attendees at the hackathon.",

        "content": "As America’s most decorated civil servants sipped cocktails in the presidential ballroom of the Capital Hilton, worrying about their table assignments and wondering where they fell in the pecking order between US senator and UAE ambassador, Elon Musk sat staring at his phone, laughing.\n\nFew of the guests at the Alfalfa Club banquet in Washington, DC, on January 25 knew what he knew: that a crew of senior executives and young Musk loyalists was preparing to occupy the top offices of a nearby federal building. Under guard, they would sleep on mattresses lined with body temperature and breath rate sensors as they raced to refactor the nation’s code base—or, better yet, scrap it altogether.\n\nMusk wasn’t big on formalities, but he’d dressed up for the occasion. The Alfalfa Club had been around since 1913 and existed solely to host a yearly banquet where the most important people in government could hobnob with the most important people in business. Membership was limited to around 200, and the Alfalfas admitted new “sprouts” only when existing members died. That evening, Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan and Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman joined the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and US senator Kirsten Gillibrand as members. Musk was attending as a guest.\n\nThe social chairs of the Alfalfa Club seemed to think that elections and constitutional norms should determine the seating chart in American political life. The head table was reserved for Alfalfas in government. Musk, the assumed leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, sat on the opposite side of the room. He spent much of the dinner on his phone—talking to the president, if whispers were to be believed. Musk was closer than ever to Donald Trump. He told friends he was crashing in government buildings. He would soon move in next door to the White House, staying in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building’s Secretary of War Suite. He’d even had his video-gaming rig installed there.\n\nAs Musk sat in the Hilton ballroom, his operatives, working under a trusted lieutenant, had already gained access to systems at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal HR department for 2.2 million or so career civil servants. Many of these operatives would show up later at agencies across the federal government—people like Akash Bobba, a UC Berkeley graduate and former intern at Palantir, the defense contractor cofounded by Peter Thiel; Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old who has gone by the online nickname “Big Balls”; and Nikhil Rajpal, an engineer in his thirties who had worked at Twitter during Musk’s acquisition, where he’d once pitched the idea of auctioning off dormant usernames to the highest bidder. As an undergraduate, also at UC Berkeley, Rajpal had been president of a libertarian student group that was fond of the motto “Futuate cohortem urbanam”—Latin for something like “Fuck these city dwellers.”\n\nIn Musk’s mind, Washington needed to be debugged, hard-forked, sunset. His strike teams of young engineers would burrow into the government’s byzantine bureaucratic systems and delete what they saw fit. They’d help Trump slash the budget to the bone. Musk turned to those around the table at the Hilton: Can you believe we were spending taxpayer money on condoms? They shook their heads. Musk looked back at his phone. Then: What if we cut all federal grants to NGOs?",

        "content": "I arrive in Taiwan brooding morbidly on the fate of democracy. My luggage is lost. This is my pilgrimage to the Sacred Mountain of Protection. The Sacred Mountain is reckoned to protect the whole island of Taiwan—and even, by the supremely pious, to protect democracy itself, the sprawling experiment in governance that has held moral and actual sway over the would-be free world for the better part of a century. The mountain is in fact an industrial park in Hsinchu, a coastal city southwest of Taipei. Its shrine bears an unassuming name: the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.\n\nBy revenue, TSMC is the largest semiconductor company in the world. In 2020 it quietly joined the world’s 10 most valuable companies. It’s now bigger than Meta and Exxon. The company also has the world’s biggest logic chip manufacturing capacity and produces, by one analysis, a staggering 92 percent of the world’s most avant-garde chips—the ones inside the nuclear weapons, planes, submarines, and hypersonic missiles on which the international balance of hard power is predicated.\n\nThis article appears in the May 2023 issue. Subscribe to WIRED Illustration: Alvaro Dominguez\n\nPerhaps more to the point, TSMC makes a third of all the world’s silicon chips, notably the ones in iPhones and Macs. Every six months, just one of TSMC’s 13 foundries—the redoubtable Fab 18 in Tainan—carves and etches a quintillion transistors for Apple. In the form of these miniature masterpieces, which sit atop microchips, the semiconductor industry churns out more objects in a year than have ever been produced in all the other factories in all the other industries in the history of the world.\n\nOf course, now that I’m on the bullet train to Hsinchu, I realize that the precise hazard against which the Sacred Mountain offers protection is not to be uttered. The threat from across the 110-mile-wide strait to the west of the foundries menaces Taiwan every second of every day. So as not to mention either country by name—or are they one?—Taiwanese newspapers often euphemize Beijing’s bellicosity toward the island as “cross-strait tensions.” The language spoken on both sides of the strait—an internal waterway? international waters?—is known only as “Mandarin.” The longer the threat is unnamed, the more it comes to seem like an asteroid, irrational and insensate. And, like an asteroid, it could hit anytime and destroy everything.\n\nSemiconductor fabrication plants, known as fabs, are among civilization’s great marvels. The silicon microchips fashioned inside them are the sine qua non of the built world, so essential to human life that they’re often treated as basic goods, commodities. They’re certainly commodities in the medieval sense: amenities, conveniences, comforts. In the late ’80s, some investors even experimented in trading them on futures markets.\n\nBut unlike copper and alfalfa, chips aren’t raw materials. Perhaps they’re currency, the coin of the global realm, denominated in units of processing power. Indeed, just as esoteric symbols transform banal cotton-linen patches into dollar bills, cryptic latticework layered onto morsels of common silicon—using printmaking techniques remarkably similar to the ones that mint paper money—turns nearly valueless material into the building blocks of value itself. This is what happens at TSMC.",

        "content": "Other Wireless Chargers We Tested\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nThere are a lot of wireless chargers. Here are a few more we like, but for one reason or another don't warrant a place above.\n\nBaseus Nomos 5-in-1 Charging Station for $150: If you liked the PicoGo W2 above but need more gadget-charging power, this 5-in-1 could be worth a look. It also has a tilting pad and retractable USB-C cable, but adds two more USB-C ports and one USB-A, along with a stats-filled display. It’s perfect for your desktop. I also tried and quite liked the Baseus Nomos 8-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station ($90), which combines a similar folding Qi2 pad with three US AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A.\n\nRapport London Formula Wireless Charging Tray for $475: Yes, this is an obscene price for a Qi wireless charger. You can probably make a version for a fraction of the cost. But Rapport's build quality is quite nice, with a lacquered grey box and a soft-touch fabric to keep your watches and phone scratch-free. It reliably recharged several Android phones without making them too warm, all while offering storage for a few watches. It's attractive, but you have to have cash to burn at this price.\n\nBelkin BoostCharge Pro Convertible Magnetic Wireless Charging Stand for $45: This Qi2-certified stand has a magnetic pad that can lay flat to charge older phones or fold out to act as a stand for MagSafe iPhones and other Qi2 phones in portrait or landscape orientation (handy for StandBy mode). It charges at up to 15 watts and comes with a 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cable and a power supply.\n\nCasetify PowerThru 2-in-1 Charging Stand for $92: If you want a charger for your MagSafe iPhone and AirPods (or other earbuds), this one from Casetify is a decent pick. It has a squared-off base with an indent for AirPods, a metallic rod, and a slightly adjustable MagSafe pad for your iPhone that charges at 7.5 watts. I don’t love the visible logo around the pad or the options with basketball courts and other designs for the base, and it has a bright LED.\n\nApple MagSafe Charger for $46: Apple's MagSafe charger is quite basic. Since the charger magnetically stays attached to MagSafe iPhones, you don't have to worry about accidental misalignments causing you to wake up to a dead device. There's no charging adapter but this is the version with the longer 2-meter cable.\n\nCourant Catch:2 Essentials for $150: Wireless chargers should look nice. You shouldn't settle for anything less! This Courant dual charger oozes luxury with its Belgian linen-wrapped surface (especially in the camel color). I've used it by my front door to recharge my partner's and my wireless earbuds for two years. The rubber feet prevent it from shifting around, but even if there are five coils in this pad, you should try to be precise when you put your device down to charge and make sure the LED lights up to double-check. It comes with a color-matching USB-C cable.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nZens Liberty Wireless Charger for $100: I tested the Glass Edition ($140) of this wireless charging pad, and it looks stunning with the 16 overlapping copper coils on display (the standard version has a woolen fabric top). It can charge two devices simultaneously at up to 15 watts apiece, and there’s an optional Apple Watch add-on ($20). As stylish as it is, the price is too high. Because you can see the coils, placement is never an issue, but it’s a bulky charger, the fan is audible at times, and while I had no problem charging my iPhone or AirPods, my Pixel 6 Pro got very warm on this pad.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nXiaomi Mi 80-W Wireless Charging Stand for $50: By far the fastest wireless charger we have tested, this stand is only worth considering for Xiaomi phones (it seems to charge most other phones at 10 watts or below). I tested with the Xiaomi 13 Ultra (8/10, WIRED Recommends), which tops out at 50 watts (some Xiaomi models can go higher). The unusual sail shape combines a white triangular section with a clear acrylic base that has a subtle groove to hold your phone in place and a gap underneath for the exhaust grill from the noisy fan. The USB-C port and LED indicator are on the back.\n\nDon’t Bother\n\nThey can’t all be winners. Here's a wireless charger we don’t recommend.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nRaycon Magic Mat Pro for $40: I love the idea of a mouse mat with a wireless charging spot for your phone, but the execution here is terrible. The spot is finicky to find, it can’t cope with thick cases, and my Xiaomi 14 Ultra would not charge at all (the camera bump is too big). Raycon says the fake leather is waterproof, but I found it a dud as a mouse mat and uncomfortable to rest my arm and hand on.",

        "title": "13 Best Hair Straighteners We Tested (2025)",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "More Straighteners We Tried\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nPaul Mitchell Neuro Style+ for $150: The latest in Paul Mitchell’s lineup of otherwise standout hair straighteners, this ceramic iron with Paul Mitchell’s new NeutraHeat temperature-regulating technology goes up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and has dual voltage for travel. However, the body feels weirdly cheap and lightweight compared with older Paul Mitchell models, it took over a minute to heat up, and it was not especially effective on my curly hair.\n\nAmika the Confidante Moisture Maintenance Titanium Flat Iron for $150: This is an effective titanium iron with a design similar to our Best for Thick Hair pick, the Sutra IR2, right down to its infrared strip. It has a hefty, high-quality feel, and it made short work of curls and frizz. However, the Sutra heats faster and keeps hair smooth longer, and the titanium runner-up, the Kristen Ess 3-in-1 ($68), does a comparable job for less than half the price.\n\nNuMe Megastar X for $169: This matte-black iron with wide 1.75-inch plates looks much like the Amika Confidante and Sutra with its infrared strip, except it has tourmaline ceramic plates instead of titanium. It was great for imparting shine, but it took at least four passes to de-frizz a section of my hair. Which may be fine for easy-to-straighten locks, but in that case you’d be better off with the T3 SinglePass Smooth X (Best for Fine Hair, above), since it’s a similar price and offers T3’s proprietary heat precision technology. The T3’s size is also easier to maneuver than the NuMe, since the plates are longer, not wider.\n\nDyson Corrale for $500: Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano loved the Dyson Corrale (8/10, WIRED Recommends), save for the price. Medea reported that it makes the user feel fancy, like all Dyson tools tend to do, and its flexing plates quickly straighten hair with less heat—they curve around the hair, avoiding the splaying-out effect and uneven heat distribution that plague other flat irons. Still, she thought it had its flaws for a $500 hair straightener. It can be used without a cord, but the battery life was too short to straighten Medea's whole head of curly hair. The onboard battery also makes it quite heavy.\n\nChi Vibes on the Edge Curved Edge Hairstyling Iron for $110: I’m a longtime Chi devotee, having owned and loved the original ceramic flat iron until it broke after a decade. So I admit, I was excited to zhuzh up my bathroom counter with this metallic-rainbow version from Chi’s Vibes line. The 1- or 1.5-inch ceramic plates (I tested the latter) actually curve around the sides of the tool, allowing the user to get closer to the roots of their hair, as well as create crease-free waves if desired. While this feature did actually do an impressive job of tamping down my flyaways (and I appreciated the unusually long 11-foot cord), both I and a longer-term tester thought the construction felt cheap, especially for the price, and we both experienced an alarming amount of movement with the plates.\n\nBondiBoost Aloe-Plated Flat Iron for $80: This iron has ceramic-coated tourmaline plates infused with aloe powder, which “add shine and frizz control every time you swipe down strands,\" according to the company. It's also unique in that it heats to 480 degrees Fahrenheit—hotter than any other iron we've tested and beyond the capabilities of most heat protectant sprays. The plates didn't look or feel any different to me than typical ceramic plates, and the plastic construction felt lightweight and somewhat flimsy for this price point. My hair also poofed up again rather quickly after use. This iron does have many devoted fans online, though, so your experience may vary.\n\nL’ange Le Duo Airflow Styler for $89: This flat iron features a clasp similar to a curling iron. Most flat iron plates stay apart, and need to be pushed together to use, while this is the opposite. It works just as well as any other iron, and the clasp design and the rounded edges make it easier to curl too. The real draw here is the air vents that blast out cool air to lock your style in. The fan turns on automatically, but there's a button to turn it off. (Just to clarify, it's not meant to dry your hair—you will not be happy if you try that.) —Medea Giordano\n\nTymo Ring Hair Straightener Comb for $60: I’d seen the Tymo Ring all over social media for years before trying it, and the wait was worth it. It's like a traditional hot comb and a straightening brush in one, but you can get closer to your roots without burning yourself than you can with a comb, because there's an outer shell covering the hot teeth. Straightening brushes aren't usually a one-stop shop for my hair, and that was the case here. I did need to go over my hair with a flat iron to smooth out some of the puffiness left behind, but the Tymo Ring took the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice. —Brenda Stolyar\n\nSleek'e for $81 and Kosa for $195: These irons are essentially the same tool. Sleek'e confirmed that they are in fact made by the same manufacturer, which is not uncommon. The Kosa felt a little lighter, but neither seemed better or worse to use. They both emit ions and have a strip of infrared lights down the middle of one of the plates, which are supposed to help distribute heat evenly and in a way that won't damage hair. —Medea Giordano\n\nBrilliance New York Smooth Pro Ceramic Flat Iron for $45: WIRED reviewer and fellow curly girl Louryn Strampe swears by this hair straightener. She impulse-bought it via a Groupon deal in 2014 and still consistently reaches for it, despite having tried several more flat irons since—she even prefers it over the Dyson Corrale. It's lost some of its heat consistency over the years, and the plates occasionally snag her hair, but it still leaves her unruly curls sleek and shiny, and most important, straight. —Medea Giordano\n\nFoxyBae Tres Sleek Flat Iron for $40: This budget titanium flat iron does a fairly decent job at straightening thick, curly hair for the price, though its flimsy-feeling construction, long heat-up time, and difficult-to-maneuver, 1.75-inch-wide plates make it less appealing than our top budget pick, the Conair Infiniti Pro, above.\n\nRevlon Easy Heat Precision Flat Iron for $29: Another entry-level flat iron, this deep-pink model with easy-read temperature settings feels heavier and more expensive than it is. I also loved that it heats up in 30 seconds—one-third the time of most irons in its price category. However, I was surprised how ineffective the 1-inch plates were on my curls, even at the iron's maximum temp of 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Plus, my (barely) straightened hair poofed back up again within minutes.",

        "title": "Everything TV Taught You About Autopsies Is Wrong",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Maybe you were one of the 11.7 million people who watched when, on House M.D., the genius diagnostician Gregory House is roused in the middle of the night by a pounding at the door. A man he just gave a clean bill of health has collapsed and died. House and his colleague Eric Foreman decide to perform an autopsy themselves. Eager to see the man’s heart, House pushes Foreman to plunge a whirring saw into the patient’s sternum. They peer down: Blood seems to be trickling from the wound. “That’s odd,” says Foreman, “almost looks like he’s … bleeding?” There’s a beat. Then the man’s eyes open wide and he screams.\n\nIf you missed this particular episode, you’ve surely seen something similar. Autopsies play a starring role on CSI, Bones, and many other prime-time dramas about medicine and forensics. They may very well be the medical procedure that Americans have been most exposed to via their screens, and yet among the most misunderstood. The way these shows depict autopsies is so disastrously wrong that they not only discourage families from opting into these vital procedures; they even diminish doctors’ understanding of how autopsies work.\n\nOn television, autopsies happen in dark rooms with blue light. They involve scalpels, bone saws. Jaded techs in lab coats discuss ligature marks and defensive wounds. Doctors frown at something mysterious and disturbing. Many (but not all) of the pathologists performing autopsies are maladjusted weirdos; the nonspecialist doctors, like House, do things that would cause them to lose their medical license. In one episode of Grey’s Anatomy, Sandra Oh’s and Katherine Heigl’s characters carry out an autopsy in direct contravention of the patient and family’s orders, which is, need I say, illegal; in another, the autopsy pathologist callously chews gum and makes a dinner reservation while cutting. In just about every single episode of CSI, techs wearing no protective equipment whatsoever stand in rooms lit like dive bars, feeding slivers of human tissue into machines that whir briefly and spit out a neat list of every foreign substance in the body.\n\nMost Americans will never see a real autopsy, so our impressions of them are formed by TV portrayals. That’s how it was for me, until I spent two weeks observing autopsies in a hospital in Pittsburgh as part of research for a novel. In real life, autopsies are performed in brightly lit rooms. (Forensic autopsies must sometimes be completed in the field if, for example, a body cannot be safely moved.) The autopsist begins with a Y-shaped incision into the sternum and works methodically through the body. Sometimes the internal organs are inspected in situ, but more typically they are removed, washed down, and dissected on a water table. The autopsist doesn’t just pick up an organ, look at it, make a diagnosis, and plop it back in; rather, they catalog as many of the body’s pathologies as possible, whether or not they’re suspected of causing death. They also take care to make sure that none of the evidence of this inspection would be visible in an open-casket funeral. It’s slow, comprehensive work that rarely involves fancy electronics.\n\nPerhaps the most subtly ridiculous aspect of TV autopsies is the lack of personal protective equipment. In real autopsies, the people involved wear head-to-toe PPE—surgical scrubs, armguards, booties, an apron, a face mask, a splash shield, and a cap—because, when you open a human body up, all the blood, bile, and other fluids that a person had in life are still in there. Blood can still ooze from a wound, even when it’s not being pumped through the body. Did the writers of that House M.D. episode think the human body spontaneously exsanguinates when the heart stops?\n\nErrors like these in TV depictions reduce autopsies to ghoulish spectacles, when the procedure is in fact a respectful and uniquely useful tool for understanding how a person lived and died. Families might decline an autopsy for a number of reasons: cultural taboos, simple squeamishness, a sense that the decedent has suffered enough, a desire to take possession of the body right away. But a death need not reach some threshold of suspicion or mystery to merit investigation; many teaching hospitals, where residents might observe autopsies to deepen their understanding of anatomy, will perform an autopsy for free on any patient if the family asks. Anyone can get one, and more people should.\n\nAutopsies, even in cases where death was expected, can serve a real purpose to the living. They help present a full narrative of disease, which can help doctors treat other patients and—if communicated well—allow grieving families to move toward acceptance. Autopsies can catch hereditary illnesses that doctors tend to miss, such as signet-ring-cell carcinomas, and reveal causes of dementia that may have been misdiagnosed as Alzheimer’s. Even in suicides, where the cause of death is usually obvious, autopsies can reveal underlying problems that might have contributed to the deceased’s distress.\n\nRead: There are no ‘five stages’ of grief\n\nDespite how useful autopsies are, they have become an endangered species. In one survey conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital in the mid-2000s, residents overwhelmingly said they had never watched an autopsy, much less performed one. And doctors aren’t always comfortable discussing them with patients’ families. Autopsy rates more than halved from 1972 to 2007, plunging to a measly 8.3 percent. In many other countries, the rate is even lower.\n\nNot all hospitals provide autopsy services; in many of those that do, asking the family of a deceased patient whether they would like an autopsy falls to residents, many of whom lack the training to properly describe and clarify the process. In that moment, there’s little to stop the grieving family from calling up all the lurid images they’ve likely seen on TV. Take, for example, a 2020 episode of The Good Doctor literally called “Autopsy.” Shaun Murphy is operating on an ER patient, an unhoused Jane Doe, when her carotid artery “blows out” and she bleeds to death in a matter of seconds. Over the next 40 minutes of screen time, the following things happen:\n\nThe hospital denies Murphy permission to do an autopsy. (Apparently, arteries explode every day.) So he tracks down the woman’s estranged son, who also denies him, inspiring Murphy to attack the man’s car, shrieking at him. Nonetheless, the head of pathology (who just broke up with Murphy) allows him to do the procedure. He conducts the autopsy himself, in a dark room and wearing no PPE beyond a cute little apron, while the pathologist stands indulgently behind him. He plucks out the woman’s liver and regards it briefly, then puts it back and exits, without sewing her up or taking a tissue sample. Finally, he shows up at the son’s house to say that his mother had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is hereditary, and that the son must get treatment. All is forgiven.\n\nThis is an episode that makes a case for autopsies. The only remotely realistic thing about the episode is the son’s reluctance to consent. And after watching that gruesome exercise, would you?\n\nRead: Health care in the time of Grey’s Anatomy\n\nOn these shows, the stark truth of a dead body is either milked for shock factor or smoothed over with holograms. Each chemical in a person’s body can be identified with a machine, and each story has a satisfying ending. Everyone knows life isn’t like that. We need to accept that death isn’t, either.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "To start with an unpopular opinion: I loved With Love, Meghan, Netflix’s goofy new lifestyle series, in which Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, smiles winningly in a Montecito kitchen that is not her own, making the hokey jokes you typically find stitched on Etsy home goods (“bready or not, here I crumb”), underbaking cakes, and strewing edible flowers on everything that crosses her path. I loved how Meghan’s core kitchen skills appear to be arranging vegetables on a $326 cutting board and emphasizing every single consonant in the word preserves. I loved when she praised carnations as a humble, budget-friendly flower, then “elevated” them by sticking one (1) into the middle of maybe a thousand dollars worth of peonies. I even loved when she made avocado toast for a quick solo breakfast—who among us?—though I screamed out loud when she promptly sprinkled edible flowers on top.\n\nBy now, you may have seen the memes—TikTok jokers radiating cheer and offering tutorials on how to “prepare” glasses of water. They skewer one of the show’s key contradictions, which is that Meghan, though lovable, is maybe in truth not very good at domestic goddessery. In the first episode, tending to “her” bees, she relies on a beekeeper, a man who could easily be Fred Armisen doing a Portlandia bit. “We’ve been doing this for over a year now, but I still need you,” she tells him, smiling. Later, she confesses, “I’ve never liked honey.” When Meghan and Mindy Kaling prepare food for a children’s tea party to which no children actually show up, the finger sandwiches look less like high-tea offerings and more like the scraps in the duchess’s chicken coop. Making tacos with a chef, she has to be told to use two forks to shred chicken breasts or she’ll burn her fingers. She is, however, extremely skilled at opening champagne—no one has popped this many bottles in the lifestyle realm since Martha got out of prison or Ina went through pandemic lockdown.\n\nRead: The many contradictions of Martha Stewart\n\nWatching the show, I found myself stuck on one question: Whom is this for? Is there an underserved niche of Santa Barbara moms with their own pristine vegetable gardens who have previously been too intimidated to attempt baking focaccia? And yet, as With Love, Meghan went on, it started to hit a few of the classic pleasure points. A beautiful woman with a wardrobe of stealth-wealth beige separates and floral dresses? Check. A fixation, both nutritional and aesthetic, on how best to feed one’s family, down to fruit platters arranged like rainbows and jars of chia seeds and hemp hearts to sneak into pancakes? Check. A strange aside where she details what it meant for her to take her husband’s name? Ding ding ding: We’re in tradwife territory now. This is absurd, of course. Meghan isn’t a tradwife; if anything, she’s a girlboss, a savvy, mediagenic entrepreneur with a new podcast dedicated to businesswomen and a nascent retail brand. So why does she seem to be trying so hard to rebrand as one, offering up this wistful performance of femininity and old-fashioned domestic arts that feels staged—and pretty familiar?\n\nIn a world in which 99.999 percent of women’s labor at home goes unseen and unappreciated, tradwives demand visibility—cut loose from the demands of a 9-to-5 job, they promise, we women can free ourselves to make the things we already do more beautiful, and to find meaning in everyday routines by turning chores into homemaking. The most notorious tradwives on social media turn domestic labor into intoxicating content; think Hannah Neeleman churning butter (with a KitchenAid) or Nara Smith whispering over videos of herself carving up pork butt while wearing a scarlet couture gown. With Love, Meghan does exactly the same thing, affirming the home as Meghan’s sanctuary after a bruising, very public introduction to married life, and the acts she performs for friends and family as labors of real love.\n\nBut there’s also a playacting component to the show that it can’t quite shake off. Most of us, I’d safely bet, have made pasta, possibly even while another person watches. But we don’t imbue the process with so much meaning. Meghan doesn’t just entertain, she explains on the show; she makes elaborate rituals out of the act of hosting, baking dog biscuits from scratch for one dear friend (who arrives regrettably sans dog) and creating a welcome basket for a beloved former makeup artist, right down to handmixed bath salts and snacks in beribboned bags. Partly, this seems practical—Meghan might not be a trained chef entirely set up for her own cooking show, but her calligraphy skills and decorative abilities are second to none. The word beautiful is peppered throughout every scene, emphasizing Meghan’s key aspiration of prettifying domestic life. Her friends appreciate these efforts—of course they do! But they’re also stiff and slightly awkward on camera, which is perhaps what all the wine is for.\n\nRead: MomTok is the apotheosis of 21st-century womanhood\n\nThe overall vibe is one of delightful leisure. “We might have a busy floral day today,” Meghan says, visiting a flower market and walking out with armfuls of bouquets, like she’s in a horticultural episode of Supermarket Sweep. By contrast, I’ve spent the past few months watching Neeleman, the superstar influencer also known as Ballerina Farm, attend cooking school in Ireland, a 12-week sojourn—her husband and eight children have accompanied her—in which, for once, she seems unafraid to show how hard she’s working. She posts about the duck entrées that go wrong, the prep work for kitchen shifts, the late nights. And I’ve appreciated the transparency of someone really showing the arduousness of her efforts, not just cosplaying scenes of kitchen congress for Instagram. Most of the content creators whom we’ve come to identify as tradwives are more apt to hide both their home labor and the fact that they do indeed have jobs (as influencers).\n\nIf the goal is inducing aspiration, With Love, Meghan is indeed “beautiful.” Walking into the room while I was watching, my husband asked if this was “one of those movies with the kitchens,” by which he meant the oeuvre of Nancy Meyers—possibly the biggest compliment any Southern California lifestyle influencer could hope for. If Meghan’s fake garden is this colorful and bounteous, her fake pantry this blissfully stocked, can you imagine the real thing? I don’t begrudge her any of her hard-won happiness making crepes to mop up all her preserves, or getting Roy Choi to help her make fried chicken. (If you watch any one episode, make it that one, because Choi really can cook, and his chemistry with Meghan is the kind people watch morning television for.) But her series, ultimately, is best appreciated as anthropological study—what impossibly wealthy women do for love and fulfillment—rather than a model for how the rest of us should enact our labors: half as care and half as performance.",

        "title": "What It Really Means to ‘Give Infectious Disease a Break’",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "For most of the past century, the United States’ track record on infectious disease has been quite good. Thanks to major investments in public health, diseases such as smallpox, polio, yellow fever, malaria, measles, rubella, mumps, diphtheria, and tuberculosis have either been obliterated or become vanishingly rare. America “led the charge,” Aniruddha Hazra, an infectious-disease physician at UChicago Medicine, told me. The nation’s approach to public health was expected to help set the standard for the entire globe’s health.\n\nThat era might now be over. In recent years, the U.S. had already begun to neglect its public-health infrastructure, weakening defenses necessary for keeping infectious diseases at bay. Now the Trump administration is going beyond poor maintenance. It’s attempting active destruction.\n\nIn two months, the administration has slashed funding for biomedical research; stripped universities of grants; triggered the halt of clinical trials, domestically and abroad; gutted the public-health workforce; canceled or postponed vaccine advisory meetings to the government; and upended the normal practices of federal agencies dedicated to promoting American health. Cuts to foreign aid have marooned HIV and malaria medications in ports and storage facilities; an Ebola outbreak has been left to swell and spread. Domestically, the federal government’s response to a growing measles outbreak has downplayed the protective power of vaccines; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has suggested that H5N1 bird flu should be allowed to burn through the nation’s poultry; and the administration is reportedly mulling cuts to the CDC’s HIV budget for prevention of the disease in the U.S.\n\nIn November 2023, while campaigning for the presidency, Kennedy declared that he wanted the government to “give infectious disease a break for about eight years.” He and the rest of the Trump administration are more than making good on that promise, as they hamper infectious-disease research and the day-to-day work of surveillance and outbreak management. Donald Trump’s America isn’t just giving infectious disease a break. It’s pivoting away from guarding against pathogens to inviting them right in.\n\nIn an email, Emily G. Hilliard, HHS’s deputy press secretary, defended Kennedy’s actions, and said that the agency “is committed to promoting radical transparency so Americans can make informed choices regarding their health.” Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, echoed this notion, and blamed “shoddy reporting about the Trump administration’s work” for low public trust in the health-care system.\n\nBefore the second Trump administration took office, the United States’ investment in keeping infectious disease at bay had already long been flagging. As the nation succeeded in minimizing infectious threats, people forgot to fear them. Since at least the late aughts, U.S. spending on nearly all aspects of public health has gone flat, or declined; after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, childhood vaccination rates dipped nationwide and failed to bounce back. COVID, rather than reaffirming the country’s commitment to public health, cemented many Americans’ antagonism toward it.\n\nRead: Inside the collapse at the NIH\n\nWhen most of a community buys into public-health interventions, almost everyone can stay safe. But the more people opt out, the more everyone’s health is put at risk. Many Americans have been making that choice more often as of late. During the pandemic, for instance, when calls to vaccinate repeatedly, quarantine, distance, and mask “bumped up against people’s autonomy,” many Americans chose to hew to what they considered best for themselves as individuals, Lisa M. Lee, a public-health expert and bioethicist at Virginia Tech, told me. Public-health guidelines are not scripture, and Americans will still find plenty of reason to debate when restrictions have gone too far, or when health officials have gotten the guidance wrong. But public health inevitably struggles in a nation where the attitude of “I don’t need to worry about what everyone else is doing; I can control my own health” has been hardening for years, Eleanor Murray, an infectious-disease epidemiologist, told me.\n\nThat individualistic perspective is now being translated into national policy, even as infectious threats continue to batter the country. After bird flu began to spread rapidly in dairy cattle, then infect farmworkers, the Biden administration lagged in its attempts to track and contain the virus, then largely left decisions about testing cows for the pathogen—the most effective way to track its spread—up to individual farmers. (Under Joe Biden, the Department of Agriculture disputed that its response was insufficient.) By the time the second Trump administration inherited the crisis, H5N1 had already killed an American—but still, the nation’s new leaders didn’t meaningfully step up the response. In the absence of sufficient cow surveillance, the virus has continued to transmit on farms; without more targeted protection of poultry and dairy workers—those most exposed to H5N1—people have continued to fall sick.\n\nAs the measles outbreak that began in Texas in January has grown—now to the point where the U.S. has logged more measles cases so far this year than it did in all of 2024—Kennedy has emphasized the importance of autonomy. Vaccinating the unvaccinated is the fastest way to stop a measles outbreak, and Kennedy has publicly acknowledged that vaccines protect individuals and “contribute to community immunity.” But he’s also repeatedly overstated vaccines’ risks and declined to directly urge parents to vaccinate their children. And his continued framing of the shots as a “personal” choice elides their protective benefits to everyone else. The unvaccinated child killed by the measles outbreak last month almost certainly would not have died had she been vaccinated. And she might never have been infected in the first place had vaccine rates been higher in her community.\n\nThe Trump administration’s actions, though, have shown flagrant disregard for the possibility of rising infection rates. Kennedy has pushed good nutrition and vitamin A supplementation as viable solutions to the Texas outbreak—suggesting, essentially, that the country’s approach to the disease should be to try to limit the damage of infections rather than prevent them. (Although vitamin A deficiency can worsen a case of measles, that sort of malnutrition is extremely rare in the U.S., and no supplement can prevent a person exposed to measles from catching it.) Meanwhile, the administration’s freeze on foreign aid halted PEPFAR, a program that has, for more than 20 years, helped deliver HIV antiretroviral drugs to vulnerable populations around the world, and saved more than 25 million lives. With that support gone, up to 20 million people living with HIV—more than 500,000 of them kids—may have been cut off from their lifesaving medications.\n\nRead: America can’t just unpause USAID\n\nThe administration is also considering a major revamp of domestic HIV funding. Among the targets may be the CDC’s budget for HIV—the source of 91 percent of federal funding for HIV prevention in the U.S., aimed at tracking infections, increasing access to tests and drugs that can help avert new cases, and helping protect at least 1.2 million Americans estimated to be living with the virus. Strip away access to those sorts of crucial resources, and “my patients are going to die,” Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious-disease physician at UChicago Medicine, told me. (Hilliard, the HHS spokesperson, told me that “no final decision on streamlining CDC’s HIV Prevention Division has been made.”)\n\nAt times, the administration has verged on advocating for exposure to dangerous germs, Murray pointed out. Kennedy, for instance, has praised the benefits of acquiring immunity to measles through infection, saying that those defenses are longer lasting than immunity derived from vaccination—a statement that doesn’t account for the disease’s sometimes deadly and debilitating risks—and baselessly claiming that measles infection might also protect against cancers and heart disease. In recent weeks, he’s also encouraged poultry farms to simply allow the virus to rip its way through their birds—a proposal that could, at the very least, devastate flocks, and at worst, risk the virus morphing into a form that would be able to spread among humans.\n\nIn keeping with his original promise, Kennedy has found plenty of ways to limit biomedical research into infectious disease. The administration has forced the National Institutes of Health to defund research that focuses on LGBTQ populations—including several projects dedicated to HIV—as well as projects that mention vaccine hesitancy. (In an email, Hilliard defended the funding cuts as “part of a broader effort to redirect resources towards more urgent public health priorities—particularly the ongoing research into the safety and efficacy of vaccines.”) Among the grants rumored to be targeted next are hundreds of studies that involve mRNA vaccines, or work in South Africa, where many global-health projects are centered. Losing those projects might directly lead to more deaths. But the terminations send a subtler message, too, Hazra told me: that many of the already marginalized populations most affected by deadly infectious diseases must fend for themselves.\n\nAbandoning the vulnerable, though, won’t make infectious problems disappear—quite the opposite. Left unchecked, diseases spill into new populations, and across borders. Diseases such as measles and polio have been declared eliminated from the United States. Without continued effort, they may not stay that way. And should those diseases reinfiltrate the country permanently, they will sweep over a population ill-equipped to fight them off again. The health infrastructure that the U.S. would have to marshal against them is already weak. More federal layoffs may be coming that could further shrink the public-health workforce. Biomedical research is being upended across fields. And should proposed cuts to Medicaid funding go through, the country will be even less equipped to deliver care to the people who most need it.\n\nRead: America is botching measles\n\nThe administration’s actions all emphasize personal freedom. But those values aren’t compatible with a country free of epidemics. Infectious diseases, by nature, exploit individualism; their version of liberty is to find the unprotected, and spread more freely. The U.S. has the money, technology, and expertise to be a country minimally affected by infectious disease—as it was for decades. Its current leaders have stopped short of saying that they’d embrace a world rife with infectious death. But their actions suggest that those sacrifices are exactly the kind they are willing to make.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "After Donald Trump announced the appointment of a new chair—himself—at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, many artists rushed to cancel their scheduled appearances. As the cancellations rolled in, the remaking of the Kennedy Center as a Trumpist cultural mecca seemed imminent.\n\nBut more quietly, most scheduled performers have not canceled. In the first month of Trump’s chairmanship, the Center hosted a children’s play based on the Navajo creation myth; a class on Caribbean-carnival dancing that teaches, “Every Body is a Carnival Body”; a Klezmer band that plays Yiddish labor music; an Afro-Cuban jazz singer who performs in Spanish; a Black jazz singer who performed a song in the South African click language of Xhosa; a Black low-country Gullah band; and an “oratorio on the fight for women’s suffrage,” as one glowing review in The Washington Post called it.\n\nRead: Trump takes over the Kennedy Center\n\nMany of the artists who went through with their appearance agonized over whether to perform. They faced a version of the dilemma that many people in government, business, and civil society have confronted under the first and second Trump presidencies: When does quitting count as resistance, and when is it surrender? Like the cancelers, those who stuck it out feared that the Kennedy Center would be stripped of its character and turned into an organ for Trump. The difference is they came to believe that canceling would only bring that scenario closer to reality.\n\nThe immediate future of the Kennedy Center is unclear, but no sweeping changes have been made to its programming. The institution’s Trump-appointed president and interim executive director, Ric Grenell, announced at a conservative political convention that the center would throw a “big, huge celebration of the birth of Christ at Christmas”—which wouldn’t necessarily be different from last year’s Christmas-carol sing-alongs and performance of Handel’s Messiah. Steve Bannon generated headlines when he told the crowd at the same conference that the Kennedy Center would feature a performance by the J6 Prison Choir, but that idea might have been a figment of his fertile imagination. (Bannon’s speech included an elaborate fantasy in which, while the choir sings, “the elite” is taken “down to the D.C. gulag.”) The prediction seemed to catch the venue’s bookers off guard; the center told the Los Angeles Times that “we do not have any information on this as a Kennedy Center confirmed event.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s directives so far have been vague. The Kennedy Center “got very wokey,” Trump told the organization’s board last month. “I think we’re going to make it hot.” Earlier this week, he reminded the board how much he loves The Phantom of the Opera and wondered aloud if one of the original Cats actors is still alive (Betty Buckley, and she is).\n\nEven so, for some of those who canceled their Kennedy Center appearances, the choice was an easy one. “I wish I could say there was some sort of decision tree, or there was angst over it, or I had moments of doubt. There was none,” the mystery author Louise Penny, who canceled her Kennedy Center book launch, told me. “I simply couldn’t do it and feel good about myself.” Adam Weiner, the front man for the rock band Low Cut Connie, told me, “It’s very clear that the Kennedy Center is the arts wing of the Trump regime, and I think that artists need to make a stand very early—right now.”\n\nThe cancelers—at least a dozen as of this writing—seem to believe that the place is doomed, so their decision doesn’t matter much anyway. José Olivares, who performs with the Puerto Rican indie band Balún, told me that the “transition” at the Kennedy Center “is going to happen regardless, whether Balún would have played or not.”\n\nArtists who are choosing to perform tend to approach the matter differently. They’re focused on the tangible effects of their decisions, not on whether their conscience is weighed down by the new chairman’s anti-“wokey”-ness.\n\nStephen Marche: America’s cultural revolution\n\nAbigale Reisman, the violinist for the Ezekiel’s Wheels Klezmer Band, told me that her initial reaction after Trump’s Kennedy Center takeover was “Fuck them all; fuck the whole place.” But after thinking about the situation, seeking out other opinions, and spending an entire rehearsal talking about it instead of rehearsing, she and the rest of the band decided to play their March 5 gig.\n\nThey were swayed, in part, by the realization that pulling out might wind up punishing the Kennedy Center staff. One employee’s testimony was especially persuasive: “His message to all of us was ‘Don’t abandon us,’” recalls Nat Seelen, the band’s clarinetist. Another group the performers didn’t want to abandon: the audience. Alicia Waller, the jazz singer who performed the Xhosa song at her Kennedy Center show late last month, is from Oakton, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. “At the end of my performance, these four little girls who look like me when I was little ran up to me with stars in their eyes, and I was like, ‘That’s what this performance is about,’” Waller told me.\n\nMany artists and patrons have a nightmare scenario in mind for the Kennedy Center: that it becomes so neglected as to be irrelevant except as a venue for the few artists who support Trump. That’s not the case yet, but liberal artists canceling their performance makes it more likely, not less. “We don’t want to comply in advance,” Kirsten Lamb, the bassist and singer for Ezekiel’s Wheels, told me.\n\nMany of the performers took advantage of the opportunity to score some points at Trump’s expense. Dwayne Kennedy, the comedian who opened for W. Kamau Bell at his Kennedy Center performance last month, told the audience, “Welcome to the last time two Black guys are going to be at the Kennedy Center.” Ezekiel’s Wheels announced during their performance that their “hearts are with Ukraine” and that history teaches us to fight against government control of the arts, and urged the audience to think about migrants as they listened to a performance by the descendants of migrants.\n\nStatements like these carry their own risks. The Kennedy Center’s new leader is not known for his tolerance of dissent. If he comes to view the institution as a hotbed of anti-Trump sentiment, he might take bigger steps to interfere with its programming than he otherwise would. But then, at least the performers will know that it was his decision—not theirs.",

Sign up for it here.\n\nColumbia University faces one of the most consequential choices of its nearly three-century history this week. The Trump administration has given the school a deadline of tomorrow to make a series of concessions in exchange for keeping $400 million in federal funding. Columbia has not publicly signaled what it will do, but The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the university was close to yielding to the demands. That would be a disaster for Columbia, for American higher education, and for the United States.\n\nIn a letter earlier this month, the Trump administration sought to dictate how the university disciplines students involved in pro-Palestinian protests last year, structures its disciplinary processes, handles masking on campus, and runs its admissions. It also demands that the university begin the process of placing its Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies under “academic receivership for a minimum of five years,” a process where universities put departments that have failed to govern themselves under the supervision of some university official outside the department.\n\nThese demands are ostensibly about addressing anti-Semitism on Columbia’s campus. Anti-Semitism is a genuine problem at the school, but these are not genuine fixes. This is an attempt by the federal government to take control of an elite private university that it sees, correctly, as a bastion of liberalism. The gambit against the MESAAS department makes this especially clear; as a member of the American Association of University Professors’ academic-freedom committee told the Associated Press, “Even during the McCarthy period in the United States, this was not done.” These demands come as the Trump administration is also seeking to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the protests at Columbia last year and a legal permanent resident. The government has still not charged him with any crime.\n\nIn their defense, Columbia’s leaders are right to be worried about the threat of a funding cut. As my colleague Ian Bogost has explained, American higher education as we know it depends greatly on federal money. This is not a matter of charity: The nation benefits heavily from research and education. The $400 million ransom here comes on top of other cuts to federal funding for universities. Yet many experts don’t think that the government’s threats would stand up to legal challenge.\n\nUniversity leaders may also agree with some of the diagnoses the federal government has made about its admissions or disciplinary practices, but these are problems for the university to handle itself. (One bleak possibility right now is that administrators would rather let the federal government take the blame for changes they want to make than face backlash from students, donors, faculty, or alumni.)\n\nSurrendering to Donald Trump, however, would be a serious error. The first impact would be on Columbia itself, which would be granting control to an administration that has been frank about its desire to knock universities down a few notches. Concession would probably provoke outrage from faculty and students, which could cause tumult, could harm the university’s reputation, and—crucially—is likely to only invite further attacks from the White House. It’s a death spiral waiting to happen.\n\nColumbia should know this better than most schools. When House Republicans assailed it over the Gaza-war protests last year, President Minouche Shafik bent over backwards to answer their concerns. It satisfied no one. She lost the confidence of the university community and resigned in August. The ritual bloodletting did not appease the right, as the current pressure campaign shows, but rather emboldened it. The White House is already looking past Columbia to its next target, the University of Pennsylvania, and if these sorties are successful, other colleges will be next.\n\nThis is a consistent pattern when people and institutions seek accommodation from this president in order to protect themselves. There’s no such thing as an armistice with Trump; there’s only ever a temporary truce.\n\nIn 2016, the Republican Party as a whole opted to indulge Trump’s candidacy, on the premise that he couldn’t possibly win the nomination. When he did, leaders decided to work with him, on the premise that he was inexperienced and policy-ignorant and could be manipulated to serve their ends. Instead, he has conducted a full-scale takeover, remaking the GOP platform in his image, purging opponents, and turning the Republican National Committee into an arm of his business.\n\nIn that 2016 race, Chris Christie was the first rival candidate to endorse Trump and assist him. That won him a job leading the Trump transition—until he was unceremoniously fired, became the butt of cruel Trump jokes, and emerged as a prominent Trump critic, once it was too late.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell also chose to work with Trump and defend him, including some of his baseless claims about the 2020 election being stolen. He seemed to believe that indulging Trump would help further his own priorities. McConnell did get scores of conservative judges appointed, but he also kept taking flak from Trump, and coddling the president helped foment the January 6 insurrection. After the riot, McConnell was furious but glad to be done with Trump. “I feel exhilarated by the fact that this fellow finally, totally discredited himself,” he told the reporter Jonathan Martin. “He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. Couldn’t have happened at a better time.”\n\nBut McConnell didn’t want to take the political pain of pushing his caucus to convict Trump after his impeachment. The result? Trump is back as president, and McConnell is casting lonely, symbolic anti-Trump votes as he prepares to leave the Senate. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy initially blasted Trump behind closed doors after January 6, but then quickly flew to Mar-a-Lago to make amends. Yet Trump did nothing to save McCarthy from an internal revolt, and he was deposed as speaker.\n\nNikki Haley and Mike Pompeo ran or considered running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, but both eventually endorsed Trump. Haley practically begged to stump for him. Once elected, Trump promptly shut both out of his new administration and later yanked a security detail assigned to Pompeo because of death threats from Iran—stemming from Pompeo’s work as secretary of state under Trump. Many business executives lined up behind Trump in this election as well, hoping he’d be good for the economy. Instead, they’ve gotten gyrating markets and fears of a recession.\n\nForeign leaders have also tried to get on Trump’s good side. France’s Emmanuel Macron has been very effective at building a friendly relationship with the U.S. president as a way of fortifying his interests. As a reward for that effort, Trump has slapped large tariffs on Europe, threatened to bail on NATO, and turned his back on Ukraine, a major European priority. It’s no wonder that Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky was willing to spar with Trump in the Oval Office. Stand up to Trump and he’ll punish you; act conciliatory and he’ll do it anyway.\n\nBack in 2019, the journalist Andrew Sullivan warned against accommodating Trump. “We are appeasing an angry king,” he wrote. “And the usual result of appeasement is that the angry king banks every concession and, empowered and emboldened by his success, gets more aggressive and more power hungry.”\n\nAs it happens, Columbia was founded in 1754 as King’s College. An imprudent choice now could result in the school becoming the de facto fief of an aspiring angry king.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nDonald Trump signed an executive order today that is set to dramatically shrink the Department of Education, but the department would still continue some functions, such as administering student loans, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Tens of thousands of articles on Pentagon websites were removed or flagged for removal to comply with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s order to erase “diversity” content. According to CNN, which obtained a database showing which content has been or could be purged, these articles cover topics including Holocaust remembrance, Jackie Robinson’s military service, and breast-cancer awareness. The Pentagon has since restored some of the removed pages. A Georgetown University researcher on a student visa was detained by federal immigration authorities over alleged ties to a senior adviser to Hamas, which his lawyer denies.\n\nDispatches\n\nTime-Travel Thursdays: The Reagan administration offers a cautionary tale about cost-cutting zeal crashing up against the reality of how government works, David A.

        "content": "This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nOne of the greatest journalistic misapprehensions of all time was made by one of the greatest journalists of all time. In December 1931, the legendary American reporter Dorothy Thompson secured an interview with Adolf Hitler, whose National Socialist party had recently surged in the polls, bringing him from the fringe of German politics to the cusp of political power.\n\n“When I walked into Adolf Hitler’s room, I was convinced that I was meeting the future dictator of Germany,” Thompson recalled afterward. “In something like 50 seconds, I was quite sure he was not. It took just about that time to measure the startling insignificance of this man who has set the world agog.” Within a year, Hitler was chancellor.\n\nWe have come to view Hitler’s path to the chancellorship, and ultimately to dictatorship, as inexorable, and Hitler himself as a demonic force of human nature who defied every law of political gravity—not as the man of “startling insignificance” Thompson encountered in the second-floor corner office of the Brown House, the Nazi Party headquarters in Munich, that day. But Thompson was hardly alone in her assessment. Much of the German press, most international correspondents, and many political observers—along with a majority of ordinary Germans—drew similar conclusions about the Nazi leader. Which brings up the question: How did so many reporters and other contemporary observers get Hitler so wrong?\n\nFew public figures have provided as easy a target for ridicule and disparagement as Adolf Hitler. He was a high-school dropout, a failed artist, and a frontline soldier who never made it beyond the rank of corporal. He was a rabid anti-Semite who did not himself possess the Aryan credentials he demanded of his followers. His father had changed the family name from Schickelgruber. “Heil Schickelgruber!” was a running joke in the Weimar years. But even the name Hitler was cause for ridicule. Hitler can be translated as “man from the hut” and appears in various iterations: Hiedler, Hietler, Hüttler, Hittler, all of which convey a sense of quaint southern rusticism, especially to the north-German ear. “Hüttler? Hüttler?” the left-wing newspaper Vorwärts wrote in December 1932, spoofing Hitler’s name. “It sounds so funny.”\n\nEven in Bavaria, where Hitler had launched his political career, he was more disdained than feared. In March 1922, when Hitler was circulating on the right-wing fringe of Munich’s beer-hall political scene, Bavaria’s state interior minister considered deporting him to his native Austria, only to be allegedly told by a Social Democratic colleague that the National Socialist leader was a “comical figure” who would soon “be hurtled back into the insignificance from which he originally came.”\n\nTo run for political office in Germany, Hitler needed to obtain German citizenship. His repeated attempts to do this were subjected to public ridicule. In 1930, after the Bavarians refused Hitler citizenship because of his felony conviction for his failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, Wilhelm Frick, the first National Socialist to secure a senior post in government, arranged for Hitler to be appointed to a position that automatically conferred German citizenship—police commissioner in the little Thuringian village of Hildburghausen. Hitler traveled to this hinterland village, swore an oath, and signed an affidavit before recognizing, belatedly, the paltry nature of the position. Returning to Munich, Hitler burned his appointment papers and instructed Frick to do the same. But by then it was too late—journalists had gotten wind of this.\n\nThe opposition press had a field day. Hitler was hailed as the “Gendarme of Hildburghausen.” “We do not wish to disparage the honorable position of a gendarmerie commissioner,” the Berlin newspaper Vossische Zeitung editorialized, “but the absurdity lies in the outspoken peacock vanity of the ruler of the Brown House, as if he really wanted to command seven gendarmes and three police officers.” It got worse: “As of yesterday, all of Europe is laughing about Adolf Hitler,” reported Tempo, another Berlin paper. And the laughter wasn’t coming just from Europe: “The whole world is laughing about Gendarme Hitler,” the Social Democratic newspaper Das Volk reported. As The New York Times summed things up, Hitler’s fumbling attempt at this backwoods path to German citizenship and political power had generated “more merriment than indignation in political circles.”\n\nTimothy W. Ryback: The oligarchs who came to regret supporting Hitler\n\nHitler’s second attempt at securing German citizenship was also facilitated by Wilhelm Frick. This effort—being appointed a mid-level civil servant in the state of Braunschweig—was successfully consummated, but it turned farcical nonetheless. As Hitler entered the room in Braunschweig where he was to take his oath of office, he reportedly tripped on the carpet, leaving his entourage frozen awkwardly in stiff-armed Nazi salutes while he stumbled headlong into the room. One observer compared it to “Napoleon appearing on the world stage in his underwear.” The newspaper Germania saw the scene as a “constitutional comedy” ready-made for the theater.\n\n“Hitler Appointed Civil Servant,” declared the headline of a Vorwärts article, which noted that if Hitler failed in his electoral bid for the presidency, he could safely withdraw to Braunschweig, with his annual salary of 5,238 reichsmarks (about $27,350 today), and serve out his time as a “diligent” public servant until his mandatory retirement, at age 65, in 1954.\n\nHitler acquired German citizenship on Friday, February 26, 1932. The following day he announced his candidacy for president, setting the stage for a battle with Paul von Hindenburg, the 84-year-old field marshal and incumbent German president. One campaign poster showed Hindenburg as Atlas bearing the world on his shoulders alongside a diminutive caricature of Hitler jumping up and down in his brown shirt and screaming, “Ich bin noch viel starker!”—“I am so much stronger!” In April, Hindenburg crushed Hitler by 6 million votes. Hitler had his chief legal counsel, Hans Frank, go to court to have the election results overturned, claiming that there had been irregularities by state officials and that Hitler had been unfairly disadvantaged by not being permitted to speak on the radio. The presiding judge chided Frank for wasting the court’s time and dismissed the case, observing that 6 million votes was too large a margin for any of Hitler’s claims to have made a difference.\n\nUndeterred, Hitler made a bid for the chancellorship in August of that year, after Reichstag elections the preceding month in which the National Socialists won 37 percent of the vote. Arguing that this gave his party the largest share of a potential conservative coalition, Hitler demanded absolute power. Hindenburg rejected the idea out of hand, telling Hitler that he would never entrust the chancellorship to a man who was so divisive, hate-filled, and unwilling to compromise. Konrad Heiden, a regular contributor to Frankfurter Zeitung, was one of the most astute political observers of the day. “The entire German nation watched as Hitler ascended the stairs to power,” Heiden later wrote. “The entire nation watched as Hitler went flying back down those same stairs.”\n\nIn the highly polarized media landscape of the Weimar Republic, Hitler could expect little accommodation in the Social Democratic Vorwärts or the Communist newspaper, Die Rote Fahne, or even in centrist newspapers such as Vossische Zeitung and Frankfurter Zeitung. But the 1,600 conservative newspapers controlled by the right-wing media mogul Alfred Hugenberg provided at best backhanded support. Although Hugenberg’s papers praised Hitler for his belligerent nationalism and his desire to destroy democracy, they lamented his refusal to enter into a coalition government as politically misguided. Hitler dismissed the critique, saying he did not need the “golden rain” of Hugenberg’s media empire.\n\nHitler found favorable media coverage restricted to reprints of his speeches in the Volkischer Beobachter, the Nazi Party paper published in Munich, and Der Angriff, the Nazi Party paper published in Berlin. To extend his reach, Hitler leased Lufthansa passenger planes and crisscrossed the country, speaking at as many as five rallies in a single day, covering an estimated 40,000 miles in the course of campaigning in the various national elections of 1932. And to break out of the National Socialist echo chamber, Hitler had earlier tried turning to the foreign press.\n\nTimothy W. Ryback: How Hitler dismantled a democracy in 53 days\n\nFor help with this, he relied on Ernst “Putzi” Hanfstaengl, who had attended Harvard in the early 1900s and called on the connections he had made there for help in establishing a presence for the führer in the international press. In December 1931, Hanfstaengl had stage-managed an international press conference for Hitler at the Hotel Kaiserhof, across the street from the chancellery. “Adolf Hitler sat in Berlin giving press interviews as though he were already Chief of State,” Time magazine reported. Hanfstaengl scheduled a second press conference for the following week, expressly for British and American journalists. The event was canceled amid concerns that the government would conduct a police raid to prevent a repeat of the previous week’s presumptuous affront. As a substitute, Hanfstaengl arranged for a live broadcast with CBS radio, during which Hitler would address the American people. But that address, in turn, was scuttled when the German postmaster general denied Hitler access to the necessary state-owned radio cables. Paris-Midi wrote of “les tribulations héroï-comiques” of Hitler’s efforts to reach the broader public. (Hitler’s planned speech finally reached an American audience when William Randolph Hearst’s New York American published it, on December 13, 1931.)\n\nHanfstaengl also arranged the interview with Dorothy Thompson. During the interview, the chain-smoking Thompson observed Hitler’s rants with bemused detachment. After the interview, Hitler said, “Don’t ever bring me anyone like that again, Hanfstaengl!” Thompson, who would subsequently be banished from Germany—and who incidentally was married to the Nobel laureate Sinclair Lewis, who four years later would publish It Can’t Happen Here, a novel about the rise of a fascist dictator in America—went on to describe that encounter for Cosmopolitan. “He is inconsequent and voluble, ill-poised, insecure,” she wrote. “He is the very prototype of the Little Man.”\n\nHitler in the state of Braunschweig, where he would be appointed to a position as a mid-level civil servant in order to gain German citizenship. (Ann Ronan Pictures / Print Collector / Getty)\n\nThat same month, Harold Callender, a correspondent for The New York Times, also interviewed Hitler in his Brown House office, in Munich. Like Thompson, Callender watched with amusement as Hitler “rose from his chair, walked about the room, sat upon the table, but was never at rest,” making “nervous gestures” and all the time speaking with rhetorical fury, only occasionally “checking his rapid flow of speech to make sure his words were carefully noted.”\n\nIn response to Callender’s question about whether the National Socialists would seek power by democratic means or if he planned to “do away with parliamentary government,” Hitler replied that he planned to win power via constitutionally approved means—and then to revise the constitution and the entire structure of government in a way that “suits our purposes and will give us the power to conquer communism and the pest of Marxism. The present State, with its present constitution, is not in a position to do this.” Later in the interview, Hitler said, “Democratic theories and admonitions do not suffice to resist a force which is motivated not by belief in democracy but by bloody brutality.” If America had as many Communists and “Social Democratic Marxists” in its midst as Germany did, he went on, it would surely adopt the militarized approach of the National Socialists toward stamping them out. Though he declined to explicitly admit that anti-Semitism was “a fundamental part of his party’s platform,” he averred that “the attitude of the National Socialist movement to every inhabitant of this country is determined by that inhabitant’s attitude toward Germany.”\n\n(It should be noted that Callender’s reporting has aged better than the Times’ first article on Hitler, which in 1922 had asserted that “several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler’s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers.”)\n\nOn August 7, 1932, Hanfstaengl organized a press gaggle at Hitler’s alpine retreat on the Obersalzberg for the CBS-radio announcer H. V. Kaltenborn (who recalled Hanfstaengl as “one of my best friends” from Harvard; they’d taken a famous course on Goethe’s Faustus there together), the Associated Press Berlin bureau chief Louis Lochner, and the Hearst reporter Karl von Wiegand. Hitler subjected them to the usual diatribe and bluster. “That man is hopeless,” Wiegand said afterward. “Ask him a question and you get a speech. This whole trip was a waste of time.”\n\nHitler did find some sympathetic journalists. One was Sefton “Tom” Delmer, a reporter for the Daily Express, the British paper owned by the Hitler admirer Lord Beaverbrook. Delmer delivered just the sort of fawning coverage Hitler wanted. Delmer, who had attended President Hindenburg’s 80th birthday celebration and covered the launch of a zeppelin, concluded that “both of these great days faded into nothingness compared with the spontaneous and unprepared demonstration that greeted the smiling, bare-headed Herr Hitler” in early April 1932, when Hitler arrived in central Berlin to find “120,000 fanatical Berliners were waiting to hear him speak.”\n\nHitler rewarded Delmer for his adulatory journalism, inviting him to dinner and providing him with his direct telephone number (50-1-05-07). He also brought Delmer with him on the campaign trail. “Tomorrow morning at six o’clock I shall be in Herr Hitler’s airplane, the only newspaper representative to accompany the Fascist leader”—Delmer meant Fascist as a compliment—“on the whirlwind with which he is winding up his campaign in the presidential election,” he reported in spring 1932.\n\nTimothy W. Ryback: ‘Herr Hitler, do you really believe me capable of such a dirty trick?’\n\nLater that year, as Hitler endured another deluge of press ridicule, he turned again to Delmer for a boost. In the November elections, the National Socialists had lost 34 Reichstag seats, and Hindenburg once again rebuffed Hitler in his quest for the chancellorship. “It was most amusing to see old Hindy take Adolf out for a ride” and “put him in a beautiful hole,” Lochner noted for the Associated Press. “Hitler had been knocking on the door to power since 1923,” Konrad Heiden observed, in the Frankfürter Zeitung, but was apparently destined to spend his political career knocking on doors he would never enter.\n\nOn the evening of November 27, 1932, Hitler summoned Delmer for an interview in the Hotel Elephant in Weimar. “Not more than four months from now and the Presidential Cabinet will have fallen and our day will have come,” Hitler told Delmer, who passed this assurance on to his Daily Express readers. “This was the challenging statement made to me tonight, in an exclusive interview, by Adolf Hitler,” Delmer reported, “whom all the world believes to be in the depths of despair after the defeat of his latest bid for power, but who is in reality radiant with confidence that the hour of his supreme triumph is at hand.”\n\nHitler’s confident bluster belied the precariousness of his position: He was at that moment in the midst of one of the toughest internal party struggles of his political career, one that led to still more press mockery.\n\nAs the party hard-liners Hermann Goering, Joseph Goebbels, and Ernst Röhm pressed for a rule-or-ruin strategy, Hitler’s more moderate lieutenants, including Gregor Strasser and Wilhelm Frick, felt the time had come for compromise and coalition building. When Strasser arranged for Hitler to meet with Kurt von Schleicher, the ultimate power broker in Berlin, to discuss potentially joining a coalition government, Hitler boarded an overnight train in Munich, only to be intercepted en route, in the town of Jena, by Göring, who boarded the train to wake Hitler at 6 o’clock in the morning and escort him off, before driving him to Weimar. Strasser and Frick were left waiting for Hitler on the platform in Berlin.\n\nThe opposition press made the most of this episode. A cartoon in Vorwärts shows a befuddled Hitler in his nightshirt, with tousled hair and spindly legs covered with protruding hairs, being led away by Göring. A newspaper headline in the same publication described “Hitler as You’ve Never Seen Him,” a satirical reference to a recently published book of photographs by his personal photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann. The incident was dubbed Hitler’s Unterhosenszene—his “underwear scene.” A taunting rhyme made the rounds, which can be translated as “Hitler’s chancellorship is now sunk / Frick and Strasser are in a funk.” One commentator observed dryly that Hitler’s lieutenants looked so clueless only because Hitler was so clueless. To read press coverage like this was to conclude that Hitler was politically finished.\n\nBut Hitler seemed outwardly not to be bothered by the cacophony of derision and ridicule. “I have endured so much persecution and so many personal attacks during the 13 years of my struggle for Germany,” Hitler explained to then-Chancellor Fritz von Papen, who himself had previously issued scathing condemnations of the Nazi leader, “that I have learned to put the great cause I serve above myself.” The only thing that filled him with bitterness, Hitler told Papen, who was seeking a rapprochement with him, was watching establishment politicians squander the “hope, belief and trust” that the common man had placed in the country’s leadership.\n\nWhile awaiting trial and execution at Nuremberg for his role in Nazi atrocities, the Hitler attorney Hans Frank observed that it had been this alleged commitment to the common man and a “greater cause” that bonded the führer to his followers. “If one is to be brutally honest, one has to admit,” Frank explained, that Hitler “said aloud what was in the minds of most people and gave clear expression to what everyone was experiencing along with a plan to address the hopes and suffering of the people.”\n\nFrom the February 1937 Issue: Hitler looks eastward\n\nFrederic Sackett, the U.S. ambassador to Germany from 1930 to 1933, confirmed Frank’s assessment that the bond between Hitler and his political base seemed infrangible, no matter how ridiculous he appeared to the reporters who covered him. “The expectation frequently voiced here that failure of his policies would result in large and immediate losses of following for Hitler,” Shackett reported to the State Department, “does not take into account the blindness of great sections of his adherents.”\n\nHans Prinzhorn, a German psychiatrist and art historian, put this in different terms. After attending one of his beer-hall rallies, Prinzhorn observed how Hitler manipulated the crowd by dramatically modulating his voice, first rising to a “demagogic register” before falling silent, then continuing to speak in a subdued tone, “as if nothing had happened.” Prinzhorn also noted that Hitler limited himself to a small number of tropes that he repeated incessantly: the “treason of Versailles,” the danger of “Jewish influences,” his vow that “heads will roll” once he was in power.\n\nAccording to Prinzhorn, Hitler’s calculated and mesmerizing combination of volume, rhythm, modulation, and repetition induced the suspension of logic and reason in rally attendees, generating an emotional response in his followers that rendered him nearly impervious to rational attack by political opponents and probing reporters. “They keep thinking they’ve hit on a crucial point when they say that Hitler’s speeches are meaningless and empty,” Prinzhorn observed of reporters. “But intellectual judgments of the Hitler experience miss the point entirely.” Ambassador Sackett called Hitler “one of the biggest showmen since P. T. Barnum,” an “indefatigable spellbinder” with an uncanny capacity for “twisting events” to suit his “fancies and purposes.”\n\n“The country is getting tired of the Nazis,” The New York Times’ Pulitzer Prize–winning correspondent Fred Birchall reported in November 1932. Hitler’s “high water mark,” Birchall declared, had been the July Reichstag election when the National Socialists had won 37 percent of the seats. The German ambassador to Washington, D.C., affirmed this. Hitler, he told the U.S. State Department, had reached “the high point of his career,” and had damaged himself “irreparably” through continuous personal attacks on the revered President Hindenburg, his refusal to join a coalition government, and his public support for storm troopers who had savagely kicked to death a Polish immigrant in front of his mother. Hitler “had disgusted people with his defense of the murderers,” the ambassador said. Die Weltbühne, a weekly magazine, wrote, “Adolphus is the man of missed opportunities: 1932 opened a path to tremendous things. He stumbled. He fell.”\n\nOn January 24, 1933, Vorwärts published a cartoon, captioned “The New Hamlet,” which reflected the widely held view that Hitler’s political demise was at hand. Hitler stands in the graveyard of his political movement, surrounded by broken swastika headstones, pondering an effigy of his own head.\n\nLess than a week later, Hitler was chancellor.\n\nHitler greets President Paul von Hindenburg on the day he was named chancellor, January 30, 1933. (Classicstock / Getty)\n\nTo return to the question: How could Dorothy Thompson and so many other experienced journalists and political observers have gotten Hitler and their assessment of the historical moment so wrong? If they did, they weren’t any more off the mark than Hitler himself. In December 1932, Hitler’s movement was bankrupt financially, politically, ideologically. The party coffers were drained, the National Socialist movement tens of millions of reichsmarks in debt. Even the loyalist ranks were plagued with infighting. Word among Hitler’s closest associates was that he had badly misplayed his cards. Hitler told Goebbels that he was contemplating suicide. Only an unlikely series of backroom deals and a frantic weekend of subterfuge in January 1933 rescued Hitler from the political brink and vaulted him to power.\n\nThe ridiculous “Little Man” that Thompson and many others had dismissed in previous years was the same person who became chancellor in 1933. The man hadn’t changed. The circumstances had. What remained consistent throughout was the demagogic emotional hold on his followers that Hans Prinzhorn had described.\n\nUri Friedman: Seeing Hitler everywhere\n\nFrom the vantage point of the present, Hitler’s rise seems overdetermined, and in some ways it was. But to have imagined in advance the series of events that brought such an unlikely figure to power would have required unusual powers of clairvoyance. As it happens, one of the few people to foresee Hitler’s ascendance was a self-proclaimed clairvoyant. Born to Jewish parents in Vienna, Herschel-Chaim Steinschneider ran a wildly popular Berlin venue called Palace of the Occult, and he held séances for Berlin’s fashionable set. Writing under the pseudonym Erik Jan Hanussen, Steinschneider published a March 1932 front-page story in the Berliner Wochenschau called “Hitler’s Future,” which predicted that Hitler would be chancellor within the year. Hitler met Steinschneider several times in the course of 1932 and reportedly invited him to his suite at the Hotel Kaiserhof in January 1933 to hold a séance. “I see victory for you,” Steinschneider told Hitler. “It cannot be stopped.” That a Jewish showman and occultist was providing spiritual guidance to the leader of the National Socialist movement was more fodder for mockery by the opposition press. “Hitler’s lucky star appears to be fading, but the cautious astrologists continue to wave the swastika banner, because one never knows,” Vorwärts reported on December 28, 1932. Vorwärts also wondered about Steinschneider’s Jewish parents, “who could never have dreamed that their son would become the promoter of an anti-Semitic Führer.”\n\nAlthough Hitler’s political struggles, and the general perception of him as a figure of ridicule, almost led him to suicide in late 1932, he was well accustomed to overcoming mockery. It fueled his ambition. Not long ago, while researching my most recent book, I listened to an audio recording Hitler had produced in the summer of 1932, in advance of the Reichstag elections, part of his effort to reach beyond the audience who read the critical mainstream press. The two-disc set is titled “Hitler’s Appeal to the Nation” and is emblazoned with a swastika that spins at 78 rpm. The recording was intended to be played at rallies across the country, and sold in bookstores, music shops, and newspaper kiosks for 1.6 reichsmarks (about $8 today). Hitler speaks in a notably measured tone—no ranting, no raving, no “Sieg heil!” choruses in the background. Still, despite the moderated tone, his seething, grievance-laden political message and his simmering mendacity penetrate through the hissing and crackling recording of the eight-and-a-half-minute address.\n\n“Thirteen years ago we National Socialists were derided and disdained by our opponents,” Hitler says. “No one is laughing now.”",

The secret of life is: Keep your eye on the ball.\n\nI’m borrowing that from a 1998 song by America’s sweetheart, Faith Hill, but if you don’t know the song, you still know that simple truth. You also know that to fail is to strike out; to fail valiantly is to go down swinging; to be surprised is to be thrown a curveball; to help a buddy out is to go to bat for him; and to succeed brilliantly is to knock one out of the park. And even if you haven’t seen A League of Their Own, or have somehow missed Jennifer Garner’s Capital One ads, you’ve probably heard the maxim “There’s no crying in baseball.”\n\nExplore the April 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nIn January, I was standing in the locker room of George M. Steinbrenner Field, in Tampa, next to my teammates, whom I had met only the night before. When we heard the immortal words of Tom Hanks as Jimmy Dugan, the aggrieved manager of the Rockford Peaches women’s baseball team, piping out of a nearby speaker, we recognized them and laughed. Then we clapped (or took out our phones for photos) as Len Milcowitz, the field coordinator and unofficial emcee of the weekend, emerged wearing a full Peaches uniform to drive home the point. He’d worn it in our honor, he said. “You represent the true spirit of baseball in this country, period,” he told us.\n\nBy that he meant that we were here only for the love of the game. As women, it was true, we could have no other motive, such as being signed by a team or even reliving high-school glory days. In fact, we had paid about $2,500 for the privilege. There were 87 of us, divided into six teams. This was the first full day of the 2025 Women’s Mini-Fantasy Camp, an annual event advertised with retro panache: “Ladies, opportunity is finally knocking and your chance to experience life as a New York Yankee is here.”\n\nThough many Major League Baseball teams host fantasy camps for men, only the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have offered them for women. This year’s camp was more immersive than usual. On top of receiving full uniforms (to keep!) and access to ice baths and physical therapists and real Yankees catering (memorably good pot roast), we were technically playing in a major-league stadium: The Tampa Bay Rays will be using the Yankees’ spring-training facility this year for their home games because Hurricane Milton took the roof off Tropicana Field.\n\nRead: Climate change comes for baseball\n\nOver the course of two days we would play 35 innings of baseball—five games of seven innings apiece, coached by former Yankees, whom camp employees referred to by the official title of “Legends.” I had several good reasons to be nervous. A friend had encouraged me to read George Plimpton’s 1961 book, Out of My League, which is about him pitching to major-league players at an All-Star exhibition game for a story in Sports Illustrated. I did read it, and that’s how I learned that Plimpton had been “a fanatic about pitching” while in school. I, in contrast, had never played baseball at all, despite being completely obsessed with watching it (at the stadium, on TV, on my phone while at work or at weddings). And I had not trained as much as I’d meant to in the weeks leading up to the camp—I’d gone to the batting cages a few times, played catch with my dad, and done several squats, but it was winter and it got dark at 4 p.m. It had been hard to work baseball into my days.\n\nThe other problem was that I don’t like the New York Yankees. When I signed up for the camp, I hadn’t thought this would be much of an issue. But then my favorite team, the New York Mets, signed the Yankees’ superstar Juan Soto out from under them, and my situation became politically sticky. When I tested a reveal of my Mets fandom to a friendly seeming woman on the shuttle bus to the opening dinner, she shushed me sharply, and for my own good.\n\nSo I kept quiet. And in this way, it was easy to get along with my assigned teammates, and it was easy to have a good time, even though our team name was the Pinstripes, which really rubbed the Yankees of it all right in a girl’s face. Our roster ranged in age from 24 to 70, and in experience from Division I softball to, well, me. Two women who’d gone to school together in New Jersey were there celebrating their 60th birthdays—Nina Kaplan, a Boca Raton mother of four who had never played baseball before, and Elizabeth Osder, who goes by Bitsy, a Los Angeles media executive who holds a place in baseball history. On April 21, 1974, she appeared on the front page of the New York Daily News when she became one of the first girls legally permitted to join a Little League baseball team, in New Jersey.\n\nPlayers stretch before a game. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nEveryone was there for fun, and so was I, but I was also there because I wanted to briefly see a real-life staging of something that is still mostly a dream and that most people associate only with a 30-year-old Hollywood movie. There’s no crying in baseball, and there are no women in baseball either.\n\nSure, girls can play on Little League baseball teams, as Bitsy did, with boys. They can play on high-school baseball teams with boys. A scant few of them have even played on college baseball teams with boys. But they don’t get their own teams. There is no such thing as high-school or college baseball for women. There is no such thing as professional baseball for women, apart from a World Cup team that is assembled and disassembled every few years. Not only is this the baffling reality; it’s a baffling reality that hardly anybody talks about.\n\nFrom the September 2016 issue: Breaking into baseball’s ultimate boys’ club\n\nAfter the World Series ended in October, with nothing to look forward to but the long and empty months before the next baseball season, I settled in to watch Ken Burns’s 1994 documentary, Baseball, which is broken up into nine episodes. “There are only three things that America will be known for 2,000 years from now when they study this civilization,” the writer Gerald Early says in the first one. “The Constitution, jazz music, and baseball. They’re the three most beautifully designed things this culture has ever produced.” Well, women aren’t constrained in their enjoyment of jazz, or of the Constitution (for now), but …\n\nOver the nights that I spent being thoroughly entertained by the documentary, I nevertheless felt a pit in my stomach that got deeper and deeper. Burns very explicitly articulates the sport as being foundational to our culture and reflective of our society’s ideals. The game is democratic because it’s fair, egalitarian because it’s simple, and perfectly designed because its creators—energetic, imaginative people—arrived at the measurements for the diamond as if through divine inspiration. Baseball rewards commitment and reveals character; it loves rule-benders but judges cheaters. It has lofty goals and serious expectations, but it allows for theatricality and fun. It glorifies teamwork (double plays, rallies, sacrifices, and even sign-stealing are collaborative) but also reveres the hero (when a man comes up to bat, he comes up alone). It provides a convenient excuse to eat a hot dog.\n\nWomen play basketball, which is almost as old as baseball but has never carried the same level of cultural significance, and they play soccer, which is not predominantly an American game. They play hockey and lacrosse. They don’t play the vulgar, stupid sport of football, but nobody should. Yet they play basically everything else—every sport ever invented, even the weird ones. For no obvious or practical or logical reason, they are allowed to love, but almost never to play, baseball. They don’t get to play America’s game.\n\nActually, contrary to some of my sweeping statements, in baseball’s earliest days, women were eager to play and sometimes allowed to do so. Several women’s colleges had baseball teams in the mid-to-late 1800s—by 1875, Vassar had a number of them, including the Sure-Pops and the Daisy-Clippers. The all-Black, all-women Dolly Vardens barnstormed in the 1880s as some of the first documented professional women baseball players; their history, largely forgotten, has been revived by the historian Leslie Heaphy, a co-editor of 2006’s Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball (which she is updating).\n\nBut doctors were convinced, or so they said, that physical activity could render women infertile or even kill them. In 1867, a nationally syndicated newspaper story blamed baseball-playing for a young woman’s death from typhoid. One of the best-known baseball players in the country at the time, John Montgomery Ward, then of the New York Giants, wrote in his 1888 book, Base-Ball: How to Become a Player, “Base-ball in its mildest form is essentially a robust game, and it would require an elastic imagination to conceive of little girls possessed of physical powers such as its play demands.” When the game became big business at the turn of the 20th century, women were welcomed at the ballpark as spectators. Their presence was thought to help civilize the environs and increase the likelihood of entire families becoming fans and spending money on the sport. But that welcome didn’t extend to the diamond.\n\nFrom the May 1928 issue: Women aren’t fans\n\nA few months ago, I had a long call with the historian Jennifer Ring, the author of the 2009 book Stolen Bases: Why American Girls Don’t Play Baseball. We talked about her work for a while, and then we talked about how much we love baseball. For many years, she said, she’d felt alienated from the game and angry that her daughter, who was an excellent player, had run out of options and was forced to abandon the sport. “There was probably a decade of my life where I was just too pissed off to even watch baseball,” she said. But Ring grew up a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and she’d recently been roped back in by their World Series run and by the otherworldly superstar Shohei Ohtani. “I watched again this year, and it’s still the game I love,” she told me. “It’s brilliant. And the best players are just thrilling to watch.”\n\nOf course, hardly anyone resembles Ohtani, even in Major League Baseball. Mookie Betts, another Dodger great, is nothing like him. He’s seven inches shorter and at least 30 pounds lighter, and plays multiple defensive positions with charisma and flair. Ohtani, one of the best hitters and pitchers to have ever lived, is faintly aloof and carries himself woodenly (and has a fantastic head of hair). “It’s the people’s game because it calls for a variety of different kinds of body types and skills,” Ring pointed out. There are smaller and faster men in the middle infield; bigger guys at the corners; pitchers who look like Gumby dolls and pitchers who look like they belong to the Teamsters. All of this diversity gives the lie to the suggestion that women physically cannot play.\n\nBut this is a storied idea that has been repeated across generations. In the mid-1920s, the all-female Philadelphia Bobbies were completing a barnstorming tour of Japan, where they surprised journalists, impressed fans, and received celebrity treatment. Back home, girls were being encouraged to play a version of baseball, with a larger ball and a smaller field, that would be more suitable for them—a game variously known as kitten ball, playground ball, diamond ball, and mush ball, and originally invented in the winter months to be played by men, indoors. The game is now called softball. The details were laid out by Gladys E. Palmer in Baseball for Girls and Women, published in 1929. Palmer was an early advocate for girls’ athletics, but her attitudes were still of their time. She offered advice on how to throw properly (girls “do not have a natural aptitude for throwing, which all boys have from early childhood”) and discouraged girls and women from sliding. As Palmer acknowledged, the version of the game she promoted was meant to be “less strenuous.”\n\nMembers of the Rockford Peaches, 1944. The team was part of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, created by the Chicago Cubs owner and chewing-gum mogul Philip K. Wrigley. (Bettmann / Getty)\n\nThat word, strenuous, comes up often. It was used by A. G. Spalding, an early baseball executive who also founded the country’s first sporting-goods empire, when he said that a woman was free to wave her handkerchief and root for the home team, but that “neither our wives, our sisters, our daughters, nor our sweethearts, may play Base Ball on the field … Base Ball is too strenuous for womankind.” The same word was used against the 17-year-old pitching phenom Jackie Mitchell, who was signed by the Minor League Chattanooga Lookouts (and who struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in a 1931 exhibition game). The baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, reportedly voided Mitchell’s contract, explaining that the baseball life was “too strenuous” for women.\n\nOne of my great loyalties, odd though it is for even me to contemplate, is to Brett Baty, a 25-year-old from Texas who was a first-round draft pick for the Mets in 2019 and was supposed to be their third baseman of the future. We have essentially nothing in common, obviously.\n\nBut something about his story has grabbed me. Baty hit a home run in his first major-league at-bat, in front of his family and against a hated division rival, but he’s never been able to string enough of those moments together. He has flashes of brilliance, and then he gets rattled by something. He starts making mistakes and looking bewildered. He loses his head. Then he goes down to the minors and plays with such dignity and grace. He wears the ugly promotional jerseys they make you wear at that level, and he hits some more home runs and learns a new defensive position in case that will help his chances of being called back up. Last year, his best friend, Mark Vientos, ended up taking the job that was supposed to be his and has excelled at it. In the playoffs, during which Vientos broke the Mets’ record for postseason runs batted in, the camera cut to Baty, watching from the dugout, whenever his friend did something great, and he was always, with no hesitation, ecstatic.\n\nThen, in the offseason, another insult and injury: His jersey number, 22, just happened to be the one that the superstar Juan Soto wanted, and the Mets reportedly had promised it to him in his $765 million contract. Soto may have gone through the ceremony of offering Baty a fancy present, such as a watch or a car, in exchange for the number, as players typically do in these situations, but it wasn’t immediately clear that he had. I took exception to this even though hardly anybody else—just a few other fans on social media—seemed to care. Are we not owed dignity even when we’re kind of a flop?\n\nThat’s a long way of explaining how my career as third baseman (baseperson?) for the Pinstripes began and ended. Though I had no experience, I reasoned that I was young and fairly coordinated, and I wanted to try my hand at the hot corner.\n\nOur first game was on one of the Yankees’ many practice fields, against another fantasy-camp team, the Bombers. When I walked out in my uniform, I felt like a ballplayer. I thought I’d watched enough of the game on television—almost every night for half of the year—to know what to do, at least basically. I quickly handled the first ball that a Bomber hit down the line to me, and I stood up with plenty of time to throw the runner out. But when I heaved the ball across the infield, it fell far short of the first baseman and way off line. The same thing happened with the next ball that came to me. And the next. My team was down by two runs at the end of the first inning.\n\nThen came my time to bat, which was my true fear. I had to be called back and reminded to put on a batting helmet. I panicked and momentarily forgot which side of the plate I was supposed to stand on. It came to me just in time, but I struck out on three pitches. Our coaches were throwing to us, and they were not trying to strike us out. They were “trying to hit your bats,” as they put it.\n\nThe author at bat, George M. Steinbrenner Field (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nAfter this, I sat in the dugout and watched the other women watch the Yankees shortstop, Anthony Volpe, who was working out on a field behind us. (“He wasn’t very friendly,” one of them complained mildly, after admitting that she had more or less been catcalling him.) I moved to center field after a few more wild throws, and Kaley Sullivan, a 30-year-old police officer from California, took over third base. One ball slipped past her, and I scooped it up and threw it back to her; she stepped on the base and made the out. This was a highlight of my life, but in my next at-bat, I managed only two foul tips before striking out again. We lost the game 9–4 and mollified ourselves by saying we would work out the kinks in the afternoon.\n\nAt lunch, I sat next to Leslie Konsig, a 42-year-old insurance representative and plainly the best athlete on our team, who had been making plays at shortstop as reliably as I had seen the guys do it on TV. It was difficult to look anywhere other than at her on the field. She wore her dark hair in a single braid, smiled easily at everyone, and moved with the ease that comes with total competence. She treated us all like real ballplayers—meaning she was a bit more specific and direct at times than our actual coaches.\n\nLeslie was there with her friend Lainey Archenault, 43, an animated woman with a strong Jersey accent. They are both moms, and they play together on a New Jersey softball team called the Sluggers; Lainey conspired with Leslie’s wife to sign her up for the camp as a surprise. Lainey, I learned, is a die-hard Yankees fan who has been watching almost every single game for as long as she can remember. She clocked immediately that I’d chosen the jersey number 0 in reference to the somewhat random relief pitcher Adam Ottavino, who grew up in Brooklyn near where I live and who played for the Yankees in 2019 and 2020. (More recently, he played for the Mets.) Though she has coached her son’s 10-and-under travel baseball team, this was the first time she’d played a game of baseball instead of softball. Growing up, she told me, she’d been obsessed with Don Mattingly—she was left-handed, as he is, so she’d hoped to be a first baseman, as he was. But she’s petite, so that wasn’t in the cards. Instead, she was put in the outfield, which she now prefers, because you get to watch a whole game unfold in front of you.\n\nBy contrast, Leslie didn’t care much about the Yankees. She was wearing the number 22 and had no idea that it was a sore spot for Yankees fans who were mourning Soto’s betrayal. “I’m more here to play,” she told me. “To feel, like, what it is to be on the field, wear these uniforms, use the amenities.” She’d been the only girl on her Little League team, and she’d played until high school, when she had to switch to softball. But Leslie still had a Yankees-fan story: She’d gone to the 1996 World Series with her dad and his friends, and they were so overcome by giddiness that they’d even included her, at age 14, in the celebratory cigars.\n\nThis set off some table-wide chatter about the most recent World Series, which the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in somewhat humiliating fashion, capped off by a disastrous error-riddled inning that saw a five-run lead evaporate in the decisive Game 5. “We played better than they did, today,” Bitsy Osder said.\n\nHigh on camaraderie, I went into the afternoon games confident that I could improve my performance. For the second game, we were on the main field—an intimidating change of venue, as this meant music blaring over the loudspeakers while we warmed up, use of the giant scoreboard, and an announcer to read off our names as we went up to bat.\n\nWe were quickly down by three, but my teammates rallied for five runs in the fourth inning, and we ended up winning 7–3. The rally was exhilarating—I was Brett Baty in the dugout. Again, I contributed no hits. I had been dropped to the bottom of the batting order. But I pinch-ran for a teammate and accepted my status as role player. This time, at least, I hit a grounder and was thrown out, rather than just flailing at the plate.\n\nBefore our third and final game of the day, back on the practice fields, we got a pep talk. One of our coaches, or Legends, was Ray Burris, a journeyman pitcher who played with the Yankees in 1979. (At dinner, he let us each hold the American League Championship ring he’d been awarded in 2012 as a pitching coach in the Detroit Tigers organization.) He sat us down and said: “You’re as good as your last game, and you’re as bad as your first game.” We were not to get big heads.\n\nIn the third game, we scored four in the top of the first, but the other team, the Captains, scored five in the bottom. I misplayed a ball in the outfield and then stepped on it, shooting it into foul territory, where it skidded away across the dirt. I made a base-running error (as a pinch runner) and I twisted myself up underneath a fly ball and felt my back wrench as it dropped behind me.\n\nThen Leslie hit an inside-the-park home run—assisted by two, or possibly four, defensive errors by the other team—and we went wild. But the Captains rallied again in the bottom of the sixth for another five runs and then we were down again, 10–6. My teammates worked a gritty top of the seventh, in our final chance to score. They brought in two runs, making it 10–8. I stared at the lineup card in horror as what was about to happen came together in my mind: I was going to be the last woman up. Two outs, bases loaded. If I hit the ball, we could tie the game—or even win, if there were two, or possibly four, defensive errors.\n\nI swung at the first pitch and missed. I let the second pitch go by—ball. I swung and missed at a third pitch. I could feel humiliation a breath away. Then I nicked a foul ball. I could hardly believe the moment was still happening. Then, on the next pitch, I heard what was not quite a crack but was still the perfect sound of bat on ball. We were playing with wooden bats, not the metal ones they have at batting cages, which sound tinny and awful and jangle your hands. I ran in a dead sprint, made it to first base, and didn’t see the ball anywhere. I was safe!\n\nBut then I turned around and saw that the pitcher had fielded the ball, which had been nothing more than an infield roller, and had thrown it to the catcher for the force play at home.\n\nI’d made the last out and the game was over.\n\nIn the early ’70s, several Major League teams hosted Hot Pants Days, which offered free admission to women who came to the stadium wearing short-shorts. Also at that time, Little League teams that allowed girls to play could be threatened with revocation of their charters.\n\nMaria Pepe grew up in an apartment complex in Hoboken, New Jersey, that was full of children, mostly boys. Whenever she was done with her homework, she would join them in playing slap ball, stickball, Wiffle ball, and any other variation of baseball they could make work. “From a young age, maybe 7 years old, I just started playing, and I loved it,” she told me. In 1972, she tried out for Little League and made the Young Democrats team. She pitched three games before angry parents reported her team to Little League’s national office; the league threatened to take away the charter that covered all Hoboken teams, so Pepe’s coach came over to her house and took back her uniform. He let her keep her cap.\n\nThe National Organization for Women picked up her case in the spring of 1972, filing a complaint with the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights. This caused a big to-do, and newspapers and radio followed the case closely, though Pepe’s parents helped her tune a lot of it out. She did vaguely know that a court was hearing arguments regarding the density of her bones as compared with boys’ bones, presented by Creighton J. Hale, Little League’s executive vice president and director of research. (This argument was based on a Japanese study of cadavers and another about skiing accidents, both of which included only adult bones.) Hale also presented a hypothesis that being hit by a ball could cause breast cancer in girls. Little League’s other arguments were impressively circular. One was that there was no sense in allowing girls to play baseball, because they would not have future opportunities to play it professionally. Another was that the Little League national charter, which specified its purpose as developing “qualities of citizenship, sportsmanship, and manhood,” would be contradicted by the inclusion of girls.\n\nNina Kaplan, a Boca Raton mother of four who had never played baseball before, hustles to first. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nJudge Sylvia Pressler found these arguments uncompelling. “Little League is as American as hot dogs and apple pie,” she wrote in her ruling. There was no good reason why “that piece of public Americana should be withheld from girls.” Little League did not acquiesce easily. The organization filed an appeal, which it lost. But by this time, Pepe was too old to play.\n\nMy teammate Bitsy said that Pepe “took the arrows” for her. Bitsy was one of the first sign-ups, and so news of her first game for the Englewood Orioles was printed in papers across the country. She struck out in her first at-bat, but then drew a walk and scored a run. She was described by the Daily News as “all mouth,” challenging the umpires and instructing her teammates on what to do. She jokes that she thinks her fly was open in one of the newspaper photos.\n\nNow easing into retirement, Bitsy plays in two L.A. leagues just for fun. Like many young kids, she fantasized about playing for the New York Yankees. “By the grace of Maria Pepe and the New Jersey Supreme Court,” she told me, “I was able to sustain that fantasy a little longer.” She considers her Little League experience a blessing. She was accepted by her teammates and she had a blast. “I am a very positive, glass-half-full person,” she told me. “I just think my whole outlook in life would have been different if they had said no to me.”\n\nFor the past 50 years, Little League hasn’t said no to girls who love baseball, but it has set them up to be a minority. Instead of encouraging girls to play baseball after the court decision, Little League encouraged softball for girls and made that their primary option. This example was followed by high schools and colleges, which offer only softball teams for girls and young women. And even if you’re good enough to play with the boys in high school, how do you stick it out, knowing that you could get a college scholarship for softball if you switched?\n\n“Anybody who knows the two games knows they are not equivalent,” Leslie Heaphy, the historian, told me. Softball has a bigger ball and underhand pitching, as well as a smaller diamond, a closer fence, and a different style of play that is both faster and simpler. Both are great games, but our culture has accepted a false equivalency, she argued. It’s “just a way of never having to address the issue that women want to play baseball [and] should be allowed to. It should be open to anybody.”\n\nJennifer Ring pointed out that the number of girls playing on boys’ high-school baseball teams hasn’t changed for decades—it hovers between 1,000 and 2,000 out of a total of nearly half a million. In recent years, Little League has held events to honor “Girls With Game,” as they call girls who play baseball or softball. But when I wrote to ask how many girls currently play baseball in Little League International, Kevin Fountain, the organization’s senior director of communications, wrote back to say that the information wasn’t available. He could only say that 32 percent of Little League participants—across baseball and softball—are female.\n\nThinking it might be a matter of a statistic being difficult to calculate for some reason, I wrote back and asked for a couple of alternatives. Could he tell me how many baseball teams have girls on them? Could he tell me whether any Little League baseball teams are girls-only? He could not.\n\nIn an earlier email, he’d sent me a link to an article about the Maria Pepe Little League Baseball Legacy Series, which was played for the first time in 2024, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. I noticed that the visiting girls stayed in dorms in the Dr. Creighton J. Hale International Grove—a complex named for the man who’d once argued that they would ruin the sport if they ever picked up a bat. He eventually regretted this position, and when he met Pepe later in life, he told her that his granddaughter had begun playing ball.\n\nThroughout the weekend, I had several conversations with women about a new Women’s Pro Baseball League, which was announced in October and is set to debut in 2026. “If it’s within driving distance, I’m going to every game,” Vicky Leone, a retired 58-year-old mother of two, told me.\n\nVicky was a regular at the camp—one of its pillars. Her team, the Bombers, which went undefeated over the weekend, was largely made up of women who had been playing together for years. When I ran into her at dinner one night, she was wearing a onesie covered in the face of her team’s coach, the former Yankees second baseman Homer Bush. She told me that in 2017, during her third year at the camp, she’d asked one of the Legends, Orlando Hernández, a former Yankees pitcher otherwise known as El Duque, to throw her a real fastball. She has no idea how fast he threw it, but she somehow made contact, and hit it out of George M. Steinbrenner Field.\n\n“I guess I timed it just right,” Vicky told me. “I didn’t even realize it went over the fence.” A player on the opposing team had to yell at her to stop sprinting as she rounded second, and when she got back to the dugout, her own teammates were losing their minds. A camp employee went and found the ball, and Hernández signed it for her. She still doesn’t know how it happened—“the baseball gods” intervened.\n\nVicky plays in three different softball leagues all year round, but playing baseball at camp for one weekend a year is important to her. “We’re like a sisterhood,” she said. Her teammates, many of whom are roughly her age, are all part of a generation of women who were snubbed by baseball. She grew up wanting to play and would often be dismissed with an Isn’t that cute? When she got older, she would talk about baseball, and boys would ignore her. When she started coaching baseball, parents didn’t want their sons to be assigned to her team.\n\nThe author loosens up before a game. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nNow she sees girls playing in the Little League World Series and has heard about the professional women’s league starting next year. “Sometimes I feel—I wish I was born now and not then, just so I could be a part of that.” But she has more enthusiasm than regret. “I would love to be a coach there, even an assistant coach, keeping book, whatever; I would love to do that,” she told me. “Am I going to? Probably not. But, you know, it’s a dream, and everybody’s got a dream.”\n\nThe idea for the Women’s Pro Baseball League was announced with a bare-bones press release. It revealed that the league would start next year with six teams “predominantly in the Northeast,” and that it had been co-founded by a lawyer, Keith Stein, alongside Justine Siegal, a well-known figure in the world of women’s baseball. Siegal grew up playing and then became a coach. She’s best known as the first woman to have pitched a major-league batting practice and for creating the nonprofit Baseball for All, which promotes girls’ participation in the sport.\n\nJemele Hill: Women’s college basketball is a worthy investment\n\n“My whole life has been about getting girls involved in baseball,” Siegal told me when we spoke in December. She is a co-owner of the new league, in charge of baseball operations, and will likely be its first commissioner. She rattled off part of her to-do list: The WPBL will need scouts, tryouts, contracts, stadiums. It will need to create a culture of girls’ baseball from scratch. And so, most important, it will need time and serious backing. Even with the patronage of the NBA, it took decades for the WNBA to reach the levels of interest it has today. The Professional Women’s Hockey League, which also started with six teams just last year, is wholly owned by the chairman of the Dodgers and his wife; they can afford to wait while it finds its footing. A new baseball league will similarly need team owners who are able to front huge costs and are willing to commit to something that might not be profitable for the foreseeable future.\n\nSiegal described her vision for the league by comparing it to Angel City FC, the women’s soccer team in Los Angeles. The fan base isn’t enormous, but it’s big enough. “The place is packed; it’s electric. And the athletes are being treated well, making money. They don’t need a second job. And girls know that it’s possible that they, too, could become a professional player.”\n\nThe only real precedent for a women’s baseball league is the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the subject of A League of Their Own. The league was created by the Chicago Cubs owner and chewing-gum mogul Philip K. Wrigley in 1943 to keep baseball alive as an entertainment industry while many of its brightest stars went to fight in World War II. He was initially the sole owner of the entire league, which was based in the Midwest and rostered only white women.\n\nThe Racine Belles and South Bend Blue Sox, both of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, face off in 1947. (Bettmann / Getty)\n\nThe league gave hundreds of women the opportunity to play baseball, and it put on some great games that impressed even seasoned baseball professionals and sportswriters. But there was always a tension, as depicted in the movie, between the gimmick and the game. The league had strict rules about feminine appearance and behavior—players wore skirts, went to charm school, and were taught to scratch at bars of soap to remove the dirt under their fingernails. The league was disbanded in 1954, and the idea was largely forgotten until the release of A League of Their Own.\n\nThe movie inspired a very brief period of trial and error. A women’s league based on the West Coast played a season and a half before its owner pulled the plug over low attendance, and the Coors Brewing Company sponsored the Colorado Silver Bullets, a barnstorming team managed by the beloved knuckleball pitcher Phil Niekro. “Give them the time all the men have had in this country to play, and you’re going to find a lot of good baseball players,” Niekro told The New York Times after the team’s first year (they went 6–38). The Bullets put on some great games and improved to a winning record in their fourth year. But marketing stunts are not meant for longevity and the Bullets, too, did not last.\n\nThe U.S. does have a national women’s baseball team, which was featured in the 2024 documentary See Her Be Her. That team competes every two to three years in a Women’s Baseball World Cup, which the U.S. last won in 2006; Japan, which dominates in women’s baseball, has been the champion in the past seven contests. Americans are far behind.\n\nSee Her Be Her, which aired on the MLB Network the week of the World Series, demonstrated the support that women’s baseball has been able to garner among former major-league stars, including Ichiro Suzuki and Cal Ripken Jr. Ripken, whose 21-year playing career with the Baltimore Orioles ended in 2001, is a member of one of the most famous baseball families in American history. During his own Hall of Fame career, he played alongside his brother Billy and was managed by his father, Cal Ripken Sr. His sister, Ellie, never got to play, though he describes her as throwing harder than he did as a child and growing into a massively talented athlete in other sports.\n\nRipken told me that he and his teammates had watched the Silver Bullets play exhibition games. “I always looked out there and saw my sister and thought, Wouldn’t my sister love to do this? ” I didn’t sense that he was putting on a show—more like it was flatly obvious to someone whose whole life is baseball that everyone should get a chance to enjoy playing it. “I wouldn’t say we were surprised, but our eyes would open, saying, ‘Man, these girls are really good,’ ” he said. “To try to figure out why that didn’t blossom at that time—sometimes they say good ideas, it’s a matter of timing. Maybe this is the right timing now.”\n\nOn Saturday morning at baseball camp, my beautiful Pinstripes took the lead quickly in our first game, which we won 6–2; again, I did not contribute a single hit.\n\nMy worst fear was realized as my teammates began to notice—or, probably, they had already noticed, and it just became impossible for them to credibly ignore—that I was by far the worst baseball player on our team. This inspired them to acts of kindness, such as high fives when I had done nothing to earn them and vociferous cheering whenever I was at the plate.\n\nIn the buffet line at lunch, Ray, our coach, tried to get at the root of my problem, which he diagnosed as mental. I told him about Brett Baty and his many struggles, and though he clearly had no idea who I was talking about or why I was so fixated on him, he seemed to agree that Baty and I had a similar problem, and it was in our brains. “What are you thinking when you’re up there?” he asked me. “I’m thinking, I hope I don’t miss the ball, ” I told him in the spirit of honesty, even though I was already 100 percent sure that this was not the correct thing to be thinking. Ray kindly told me that this was not the correct thing to be thinking.\n\nI never wanted to be a baseball player and my performance at baseball camp doesn’t matter. These games, however, were meaningful to women who, by playing them, were making peace with their childhood fantasies after many, many years. One such person was my teammate Susie McNamara, who at 53 years old was attending her third camp. One evening, she told me that she was doing so this time to mark the end of chemo treatments, which she’d finished two months prior. But the first time she came, in 2011, she’d wanted to prove something.\n\nSusie grew up in a baseball family. Her grandfather played for the Yankees’ farm team the Newark Bears. Her father was a police officer but also owned a baseball-card shop in Lambertville, New Jersey. He convinced everyone that it would be safe for her to start playing T-ball when she was 4 years old, and, later, that she could play Little League baseball with the boys. She was teased in school, she remembered, for wearing a baseball cap all the time (“It wasn’t, like, a fashion statement,” the way it is now) and for dreaming of being a Yankee.\n\nShe had to give that up when she was 12, and her primary option was softball. She would go on to play for Mount St. Mary’s, a Division I school in Maryland, but the coaching was terrible and the experience was miserable. Her sophomore year, the team’s record was one win, 31 losses. “I bet that one felt really good, though,” I suggested, but I was wrong. “That one broke my heart,” she said.\n\nWhen she showed up at camp the first time, she thought of it as her opportunity to demonstrate what she could do. The Legends that year included one of her heroes, Bucky Dent, who stopped and stared theatrically when she made an impressive play at third base. She also remembers Darryl Strawberry standing over her after she made a diving backhanded catch in foul territory and screaming, “That was outstanding!” She thought that weekend was probably the best she’d ever played in her life.\n\nIn our final game, against the Bambinos, the Pinstripes were on fire. The other women had perfected the team’s defense over the course of the weekend—it didn’t hurt that I didn’t touch the ball once—and the only thing left for us to accomplish was a hit from me. I was not the only one who felt this way. Others said it, including Leslie, who told me, “I’m committed to you getting a hit.” (And Lainey, who said, “Let’s go, Ottavino!”)\n\nIn my first at-bat, I swung on the first pitch and something happened. The ball dribbled up the first-base line and the first baseman scooped it up easily, tagging me as I passed. But a run scored! No hits, but one RBI!\n\nThe Pinstripes celebrate a victory in their last game of the weekend. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nAfter taking the lead in that inning, we were winning for the entire game, so the pressure on me—from that angle—was quite low. In my second at-bat, my team cheered wildly for me on every pitch. I hit the ball just foul down the first-base line, felt a momentary jolt of hope because of the hard contact, and then struck out. In my third and final at-bat, my team cheered wildly for me again, and I struck out again. “Next year!” I announced, in a voice that was supposed to be playful and make everybody feel less awkward, but actually sounded childish and a bit unhinged.\n\nIt was ridiculous how upset I was. I was shocked at myself. I hadn’t been expecting it, but the admonition of “no crying in baseball” became suddenly relevant—I had to duck into the tunnel for a few seconds to regain my composure. My teammates, who were geniuses, politely ignored me for five minutes. And then our careers as New York Yankees were over. We had won our final game and went home with a record of three wins and two losses, which you might notice is a .600 winning percentage, higher than that of the actual Yankees last year. We drank Miller Lite in the locker room and swapped phone numbers.\n\nI texted my college roommate from Staten Island that I would mail her all the Yankees merchandise that had been included in the price of admission. I texted my boyfriend that I had a new appreciation for the game and was humbled. I texted my dad, “One RBI!” There’s no crying in baseball, and the other thing they’re always saying is that baseball is a game of failure. If you have a really good batting average, you’re failing about 70 percent of the time. Most women, like most men who try the game of baseball, aren’t up to it. They crumble, like me, and like Brett Baty has in the past, though I am confident he will not do so this year.\n\nAt the start of her book, Jennifer Ring mentions the Burns baseball documentary, noting that it is more than 18 hours long but spends just a few minutes on women playing baseball in the 1800s, and then another few on the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and ’50s.\n\nThis is particularly strange because the episode about the ’60s and ’70s touches on other issues of the day—Vietnam, civil rights, social unrest—but makes no mention of NOW’s involvement in the Little League legal battle, which would seem to fit in fairly naturally. Baseball is the definitive story of the game in this country, which is why Ring brings it up. “He’s including it in his history, but he’s giving it the position that he thinks it deserves.”\n\nBaseball is for the fastidious—a game in which everything matters. Reflecting in 1981 on the past 50 years of his life as a fan, Roger Angell wrote: “All of us who have followed the game with intensity have found ourselves transformed into walking memory banks, humming with games won, games lost, batting averages and earned-run averages, games started and games saved, ‘magic numbers,’ final standings, lifetime marks, Series, seasons, decades, epochs.”\n\nEvery play is recorded. Every pitch is remembered. It all counts. Every mistake. Every miracle. You can hear the delight and shock in an announcer’s voice when they see something that has somehow never happened before in the history of millions of plays. If you watch enough baseball, you can just feel when something is really something. (Baty’s three-run homer at Tropicana Field, which disappeared into the late, great ceiling and never came down?) In a game in which everything matters, in which we who love it wish to see every possible outcome unfold, how can we stomach the absence of women’s baseball?",

Sign up for it here.\n\nWho will defend the federal government against itself? Donald Trump’s administration is waging an aggressive campaign against the executive branch as it has long existed. Democratic leaders in Congress have demonstrated in the past week that they have neither the ability nor the will to slow Trump down. Individual federal employees—such as former Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, whom I profiled last week—have sued, but such suits take time and money that few individuals possess.\n\nState attorneys general, though, see an opportunity. This month, the chief law-enforcement officers of blue states have been working to enforce federal laws against the federal government, and they’ve had some success.\n\nLast week, a federal judge in Maryland ordered the government to temporarily rehire thousands of probationary federal workers in many departments. The judge, James Bredar, concluded that the administration had mass-fired workers using bogus claims of performance issues rather than the required procedures for a reduction in force. “The sheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of days belies any argument that these terminations were due to the employees’ individual unsatisfactory performance or conduct,” he wrote.\n\nThat’s plain enough. What is interesting is that the suit was brought not by the workers who’d been fired but by Democratic attorneys general in 20 states. In order to convince the court that they had standing to intervene, even though the workers are private citizens employed by the federal government, they alleged that their states were harmed in various ways, focusing on how the failure to provide the legally required notice of the terminations left states scrambling to provide services to the workers. They also argued that the layoffs harmed the states because of lost income taxes. Bredar was fairly skeptical of some of the economic arguments but found that the states nonetheless had standing to sue.\n\nThe probationary-workers case is just one of several such lawsuits. In another last week, 21 states petitioned courts to prevent the Education Department from firing hundreds of workers. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to review rulings by lower courts, which were successfully petitioned by state attorneys general, that block his executive order purporting to get rid of birthright citizenship. If you’re not a fan of the Trump administration, these developments may seem like great news. But what’s legal for the goose is also legal for the gander, which is why state lawsuits on federal issues are something that should perhaps give all Americans pause.\n\nStates have long sued the federal government over alleged impositions on their prerogatives, but in 2007, after Massachusetts sued the EPA for failing to regulate carbon dioxide, the justices ruled for the state and said that states have special standing to sue in federal court to ensure that federal agencies are following federal laws. State attorneys general were more than happy to take advantage of the new leeway.\n\n“What we’ve seen since around the George W. Bush administration is this massive increase in state lawsuits,” Tara Leigh Grove, a law professor at the University of Texas, told me. “It’s just the name of the states that change from administration to administration.”\n\nThat time period coincides with increasing partisan polarization. Although attorney general is ostensibly a lawyerly position, an old joke runs that AG is an abbreviation for aspiring governor. Having a big legal fight with a president of the opposing party is a good credential to have as a candidate. In 2013, then–Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott described his job this way: “I go into the office in the morning, I sue Barack Obama, and then I go home.” Since then, he has landed a new job—as governor of Texas.\n\nTwo partisan organizations, the Republican Attorneys General Association and the Democratic Attorneys General Association, have grown in importance in recent years, raking in millions in outside contributions. These groups are subject to the same capture by special interests that has come to dominate other areas of politics, with the same warping effect on their incentives that it has everywhere else.\n\nEven when attorneys general aren’t motivated by base partisanship (in both senses of the word base), they don’t necessarily represent the interests of all Americans. What is valuable and important to constituents in Nevada may be very different from what’s valuable and important to those in South Carolina. This is why we have a federal government that sets national policies, but in a moment of tumult, state attorneys general are one of the few forces that can battle Washington.\n\nGrove told me she understands why Trump critics might see lawsuits by state attorneys general as a godsend. The administration is taking many actions that “neither Republican nor Democratic administrations have thought to do, and that’s really, really jarring,” she said. “There’s a desire for a check in the system, and right now, a lot of people are looking to the courts as the key check to the system.”\n\nBut not all checks are created equal. One of my enduring interests in the Trump era has been the ways in which he forces the country to choose between bad and worse situations. For example, charging a former president with crimes sets a dangerous precedent that could precipitate political retribution, but not charging a former president who allegedly absconded with documents and attempted to subvert an election sets an even worse one.\n\nSomething similar, though less drastic, is at play here. Is it better for states to have no recourse at all, or to have recourse that the other political side can use to tie you in knots? You might have approved of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton using such suits to hamstring Joe Biden’s administration—but if so, you might be less enthused about Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown using the same methods to prevent Trump from enacting his priorities. And the flood of state lawsuits producing nationwide injunctions has made it more difficult for presidential administrations of either party to implement their agenda.\n\nSome scholars see more positive effects. They note, among other things, that state and federal implementation of laws is so intertwined that attempting to disentangle the interests of each is practically impossible. They also celebrate state lawsuits as a tool of dissent—for example, from the excesses of the Bush-era Patriot Act. But enlarging the power of states cuts both ways. Progressives have historically been skeptical of states’-rights arguments, in part because they were once used to defend racist policies within state boundaries. In a nationally polarized environment, where states are asking courts to block laws nationwide, the effect is even broader. One state’s dissent is another state’s outrageous obstruction.\n\nGrove wrote a law-review article in 2016 arguing for more stringent limits on state standing. “It’s been really interesting, the different reception that that article has gotten over the years,” she told me drily. When it was published, during the Obama administration, progressives agreed with her; once Trump took office, suddenly it was conservatives who most appreciated the argument. The valence flipped again during the Biden presidency. Maybe there should be a golden rule of state lawsuits: Sue your political opponents as you would like to be sued.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nThe Pentagon was scheduled to brief Elon Musk today on a military plan for the possibility of war with China, according to The New York Times. After the story published, Donald Trump denied it, and Musk met with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth instead. In a Truth Social post, Trump asked the Supreme Court to stop any nationwide injunctions from federal judges who have ruled against his administration’s actions. Trump announced plans for America’s $1.6 trillion student-loan portfolio and special-education services, which are currently overseen by the Department of Education, to be managed by other government entities.\n\nDispatches\n\nThe Books Briefing: How do we know when, or whether, to change our mind?

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Othello has long been understood as a play about race, love, and jealousy. But it is also a play about soldiers experiencing what we now call post-traumatic stress. In March 1947, Judge Harry Stackell, of the Bronx County Court, thought as much when he sentenced Victor Vigotsky to a relatively brief prison term. Vigotsky, a 23-year-old combat veteran who had returned from the Second World War after fighting for four years in Europe, was convinced that his young wife, Gloria, had been unfaithful. He killed her with his .45-caliber pistol “in a fit of jealousy.” When the police arrived at the scene, Vigotsky “was in a daze and apparently did not realize his wife was dead.” Before standing trial, he was taken to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric evaluation. In rendering a sympathetic sentence, Judge Stackell “likened Vigotsky’s action to that of Othello,” according to a New York Times article. The assistant district attorney, who had sought a longer prison term, objected that “there was no Iago here to inflame jealousy in Othello’s mind.”\n\nVigotsky's case came to mind during my time as a Shakespeare consultant for Kenny Leon’s Othello, a new Broadway adaptation in which PTSD is central to the plot. In a setting noted as “the near future,” Othello (Denzel Washington), Iago (Jake Gyllenhaal), Cassio (Andrew Burnap), and Emilia (Kimber Elaine Sprawl) are all battle-tested United States Marines. Othello reminds the gathered senators in Venice, who are about to dispatch him to a new front, that since his youth he has been engaged in combat. When, later in the play, he suffers an epileptic seizure, the price he has paid for such a life becomes clear. Emilia and Desdemona (Molly Osborne), married to traumatized soldiers, will pay with their lives. The production takes this aspect of Shakespeare’s story seriously: To deepen the cast’s understanding of the military and PTSD, Christopher Wolfe, a decorated West Point graduate who served in Iraq, was brought in as a military consultant. Other veterans familiar with PTSD spoke with the cast, including Mark “Ranger” Jones, who served as the aide to the commander of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, and retired General Nadja West, a former surgeon general of the U.S. Army.\n\nSome treatments of Shakespeare—including Laurence Olivier’s influential 1944 film of Henry V—envision the playwright’s first audiences as boisterously cheerful Elizabethans streaming into the Globe Theatre. That would not have been the case for those who went to see his latest tragedy, Othello, in 1604. The “news” shared early on in the play—“our wars are done”—would have struck a resonant chord, coming soon after the end of England’s own long war to crush an Irish insurrection.\n\nThe cost of that war was high: Roughly 30,000 Englishmen, ill-equipped and poorly trained, had been rounded up, some of them snatched outside churches and playhouses, and shipped off to join British forces garrisoned in Ireland. Thousands of them died there, along with far higher casualties among Irish men, women, and children, in a nine-year war that was won only after traditional military strategies gave way to starving the Irish into submission. Atrocities included reports of severed heads taken as trophies.\n\nCare for England’s returning veterans was woefully inadequate. A new stock character began limping across Elizabethan stages in plays such as The Shoemaker’s Holiday: the maimed and embittered combat veteran. Audiences knew what was at stake when, in Shakespeare’s Pericles, a character asks, “What would you have me do? / Go to the wars, would you, where a man may serve seven years for / the loss of a leg, and have not money enough in the / end to buy him a wooden one?”\n\nThe impact of demobilization extended into every corner of England, including Shakespeare’s Stratford-Upon-Avon, which petitioned the government, unsuccessfully, to “be eased” of the obligation to support “one Lewis Gilbert, a maimed soldier in Ireland.” We don’t know what Gilbert, a butcher by trade, was like before he came home, but after his return from Ireland he was accused of breaking into a local shop and fatally stabbing a neighbor. We would now likely label what Gilbert was experiencing as PTSD.\n\nRead: Shakespeare wrote insightfully about women. That doesn’t mean he was one.\n\nThis wasn’t the only source of trauma that Othello’s first audiences had to reckon with, because the end of the Irish war, in the spring of 1603, coincided with a terrible outbreak of bubonic plague. By the time it subsided a year later, roughly 30,000 Londoners (one in six) had died, and perhaps another 30,000 or so had been infected but managed to survive. At the peak of the pandemic, more than 3,000 Londoners died in a single week. It’s hard to fathom the horrors of living through this. The plague-stricken were locked in their home (and the words lord have mercy on us were painted on the door). Those caught escaping from quarantine with visible plague sores were subject to execution. Bodies were dumped in mass graves. The civic authorities couldn’t figure out what caused the plague, but they knew that crowds spread it, so they ordered the theaters closed when plague deaths reached more than 30 a week. London’s playhouses would not reopen until April 1604, around the time that Othello was first publicly staged.\n\nThat term PTSD entered the vocabulary only in the early 1980s, in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Previous wars had their own names for it: battle fatigue, soldier’s heart, war neurosis, shell shock. Shakespeare was familiar enough with its symptoms to describe them in a speech that Lady Percy makes in Henry IV, Part One, written around 1597, a few years into the Irish war. She asks her martial husband, Hotspur, what ails him:\n\nwhat is ’t that takes from thee\n\nThy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?\n\nWhy dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,\n\nAnd start so often when thou sit’st alone?\n\nWhy hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks,\n\nAnd given my treasures and my rights of thee\n\nTo thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy?\n\nIn thy faint slumbers I by thee have watched,\n\nAnd heard thee murmur tales of iron wars…\n\nThy spirit within thee hath been so at war\n\nAnd thus hath so bestirred thee in thy sleep,\n\nThat beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow\n\nLike bubbles in a late-disturbèd stream;\n\nAnd in thy face strange motions have appeared,\n\nSuch as we see when men restrain their breath\n\nOn some great sudden hest.\n\nDesdemona, like Lady Percy, had to deal with a husband who lived a soldier’s life. Othello recounts how he has spent his years “in the tented field, / And little of this great world can I speak, / More than pertains to feats of broil and battle.” Iago had fought alongside him and “seen the cannon, / When it hath blown his ranks into the air, / And, like the devil, from his very arm / Puff’d his own brother.” Like Lady Percy’s speech, Othello runs through various symptoms of what might today be described as PTSD, including Othello’s seizure; his angry outbursts, paranoia, and depressive thoughts; and his penchant for domestic violence and suicide.\n\nProducers and directors have made efforts in recent years to capture what it must have felt like to see Shakespeare’s plays in his own day: original pronunciation and costuming, playhouses built to resemble the open-air Globe. But there are other, less palpable features of playgoing back then, including the collective experience of the recent war and pandemic. Shakespeare understood what spoke to his times; he knew, too, that those who warily returned to the reopened Globe to see his new play would have recognized the trauma at the core of Othello’s tragedy.",

        "title": "The Severance Twist I Can’t Forgive",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "This article contains spoilers through the finale of Severance Season 2.\n\nThe world of Severance is so unfailingly cold, so sterile, that the seventh episode of Season 2, “Chikhai Bardo,” came as a palpable shock. Flashback scenes detailing the love story and marriage of Gemma (Dichen Lachman) and Mark (Adam Scott) were stylistically totally different; they featured dappled natural light and ambient noise, and were shot on film—a production choice that gave both characters a grainy, imperfect aura. Directed by the cinematographer Jessica Lee Gagné, the episode explained what happened to Gemma after her supposed death in a car crash—her severance into multiple consciousnesses, each one set up to endure a different kind of torment, and her captivity on a hidden floor of Lumon that she never gets to leave. But it also drew a sharp distinction between the corporation’s frigid absurdity, with its history of ether-huffing children and creepy animatronic hall of founders, and the naturalistic humanity of the world beyond it. “Who are you?” Mark asks Gemma when they first meet, donating blood via ominously Lumon-branded equipment. This is, I should note, exactly the same question he asks Helly R. (Britt Lower) in the opening seconds of the series. Unlike Helly, though, Gemma has no trouble responding.\n\nSeason 2 made Gemma fully human, after first introducing her as Lumon’s robotic, apparently lobotomized “wellness counselor,” Ms. Casey. Unsevered, the show revealed, Gemma was funny, sharp, fully in love with Mark, and devastated by her inability to have a child with him. Lumon has always been sinister in a buffoonish way, but its treatment of Gemma in “Chikhai Bardo” was horrifically evil: preying on her pain at a reproductive clinic, faking her death, confining her to windowless quarters, lying to her about Mark’s new life, and experimenting on her like a lab rat, making her suffer through staged dentist appointments and airplane disasters over and over and over again. All of this is in service of a mission that, after the Season 2 finale, “Cold Harbor,” remains blurry but seems to entail sacrificing Gemma in a goat-attended ritual in order to revive the consciousness of Lumon’s founder, Kier Eagan. (And, yes, I feel high even typing these words.)\n\nRead: Severance cannot save you\n\nSeason 1 of Severance spent enough time outside of Lumon to fully underscore how weird the company was, with its cultlike devotion to Kier, its obsession with round foods (eggs, melons, waffles), its bizarrely hostile leadership. The people who fleshed out the show’s world beyond the company—a Lumon-protesting punk band; Mark’s sister, Devon (Jen Tullock); and even depressed Mark himself—were mostly recognizably normal. Its inner acolytes came across, by contrast, as uncannily contrived kooks. Season 2, though, has confined itself more closely to the Lumon realm, which made “Chikhai Bardo” and its depiction of pre-severed Mark and Gemma stand out. And, to me, the season’s cramped, airless Lumon setting also made the finale’s closing scenes crueler, as outie Mark rescued Gemma from the company’s netherworld, only for innie Mark to abandon her on the other side of the door, screaming, while he ran back toward Helly.\n\nAt a theoretical level, the final twist makes sense. Innies and outies, Severance has emphasized throughout Season 2, are essentially different people with distinct personalities, needs, desires, and moral compasses. Innie Mark, emotionally innocent and as impulsive as an adolescent, might indeed choose Helly, even if the two are now trapped together with no conceivable way out. The ending sets up a third season of Severance that remains relatively stable, with the Lumon CEO Jame Eagan likely still intent on completing Kier’s “grand addendum,” even if it means ignoring yet another messy employee uprising. And Lower’s double-edged work this season toggling between her innie, the lovely, irreverent Helly, and her outie, the icy, manipulative Helena, has been astonishing, more than justifying the ending by emphasizing the show’s philosophical questions about nature versus nurture and whether love can transcend severance. So why is what happened to Gemma still so hard to swallow?\n\nMaybe because, on the show, Gemma has only ever experienced suffering: before Lumon, during Lumon, and now after. Even in her escape, she’s losing something yet again. (Lachman’s bewildered, “Mark S? What’s taking place?” as she found herself kissing him in the elevator, having switched into the severed mode of Ms. Casey, was pitch-perfect.) Otherwise, “Cold Harbor” did everything it needed to plot-wise, while throwing a spectacularly nervy marching-band set piece and a teeth-grindingly stressful escape sequence into the mix. There were revelations. (Mark has indeed been coding different souls for Gemma this whole time, as part of a momentous project to possibly bring back Kier—which does, though, urge the question of whom the other innies have been refining.) There were suggestions. (Is Kier Eagan actually alive in digital form, imprisoned in the animatronic form of himself?) There were hugely gratifying insurrections—Dylan and the marching band against Seth Milchick, the manager of the severed floor; Milchick against a roboticized Kier; the mysterious goat lady against the Lumon manager Mr. Drummond. (Emil thanks you.)\n\nRead: What are the puzzles of Severance about?\n\nThere were also eggs. So many eggs! (Presumably, with the show’s rumored $20 million an episode budget, the show can afford them.) We spent so much time this season pondering the meaning of the goats when the eggs were there all along: raw eggs, egg bars, eggs cut neatly into six different segments, served on the most menacing plate a prop master ever thrifted. From its opening scenes, Severance has presented the procedure the show is named for as a kind of birth, the spawning of a new, immature being. With “Cold Harbor,” we finally got a sense of the full life cycle. The childlike innies have become more akin to teenagers, discovering sexuality and falling in love. Next, it’s presumed, comes adulthood, and then death, and then resurrection via blobs of data with four tempers.\n\nAnd apparently, with death come sacrificial scapegoats. A show as rich in symbols, details, and Easter eggs as this one is always going to be thrilling to decode, with Reddit threads and screenshots trying to make sense of the mysteries. The challenge for the finale was offering just enough to keep hard-core Severance-heads engaged without alienating the less committed viewer or relinquishing the qualities that make for satisfying television. And, for the most part, “Cold Harbor” succeeded. The rest of the season, though, had more than a few bugs in its system. Is Mark, after undergoing a process designed to reintegrate his two minds, still severed or not? Who actually is Reghabi, the ex-Lumon employee doing brain surgery on Mark in his basement? Is Ricken, Mark’s offbeat brother-in-law, anything more than comic relief? The revelation that so many of Lumon’s core characters, including Harmony Cobel, have been damaged by both trauma and repetitive exposure to ether as children might help explain their sheer strangeness. But the show’s focus on expanding the historical lore of Lumon this season left it less time to devote to its characters, the verbose and truly fascinating Milchick among them. (Severance: The Lexington Letter, a fictional e-book released to accompany the series, hints that Milchick is related to a newspaper editor, which perhaps explains his love of words.)\n\nLast week, The Guardian posited that Severance has become the smash it is because it offers different things to different tastes (or even different tempers): puzzle-box mythology, workplace comedy, allusions to cultlike organizations and the heartlessness of corporate America, an overarching sense of dread. But for me, what makes the show so captivating is its humanity: the riveting, fleeting moments when the characters feel real, despite the eggy, etherized monstrousness of the world they’re trapped in. Should Severance return for a third season (which it seems fated to—praise Kier), all the pieces seem set up for more ambitious, absurd storytelling. But I’ll still be craving justice for Gemma.",

He was captured in the Battle of the Bulge and spent five months in a Dresden prison camp. He is now working for General Electric in Schenectady and writing a novel in his spare time.\n\n“I was astonished one day in 1944, in the midst of front-line hell-raising, to learn that I had been made interpreter, Dolmetscher if you please … It had never entered my head that I had what it took to dolmetsch.”\n\nI WAS astonished one day in 1944, in the midst of front-line hell-raising, to learn that I had been made interpreter, Dolmetscher if you please, for a whole battalion, and was to be billeted in a Belgian burgomaster’s house within artillery range of the Siegfried Line.\n\nIt had never entered my head that I had what it took to dolmetsch. I qualified for the position while waiting to move from France into the front lines. While a student, I had learned the first stanza of Die Lorelei by rote from a college roommate, and I happened to give those lines a dogged rendition while working within earshot of the battalion commander. The colonel (a hotel detective from Mobile) asked his executive officer (a dry-goods salesman from Knoxville) in what language the lyrics were. The executive withheld judgment until I had bungled through Der Gipfel des Berges foo-unk-kelt im Abendsonnenschein.\n\n“Ah believes tha’s Kraut, Cuhnel,” he said.\n\nThe colonel felt that his role carried with it the obligation to make quick, headstrong decisions. He made some dandies before the Wehrmacht was whipped, but the one he made that day was my favorite. “If tha’s Kraut, whassat man doin’ on the honey-dippin’ detail?” he wanted to know. Two hours later, the company clerk told me to lay down the buckets, for I was now battalion interpreter.\n\nOrders to move up came soon after. Those in authority were too harried to hear my declarations of incompetence. “You talk Kraut good enough foah us,” said the executive officer. “Theah ain’t goin’ to be much talkin’ to Krauts where we’re goin’.” He patted my rifle affectionately. “Heah’s what’s goin’ to do most of youah interpretin’ fo’ ya,” he said. The executive, who learned everything he knew from the colonel, had the idea that the American Army had just licked the Belgians, and that I was to be stationed with the burgomaster to make sure he didn’t try to pull a fast one. “Besides,” the executive concluded, “theah ain’t nobody else can talk Kraut at all.”\n\nI rode to the burgomaster’s farm on the same truck with three disgruntled Pennsylvania Dutchmen who had applied for interpreters’ jobs months earlier. When I made it clear that I was no competition for them, and that I hoped to be liquidated within twenty-four hours, they warmed up enough to furnish the interesting information that I was a Dolmetscher. They also decoded Die Lorelei at my request. This gave me command of about forty words (par for a two-year-old), but no combination of them\n\nwould get me so much as a glass of cold water.\n\nEvery turn of the truck’s wheels brought a new question: “What’s the word for Army? . . . How do I ask for the bathroom? . . . What’s the word for sick? . . . well? . . . dish? . . . brother? . . . shoe?” My phlegmatic instructors tired, and one handed me a pamphlet purporting to make German easy for the man in the foxhole.\n\n“Some of the first pages are missing,” the donor explained as I jumped from the truck before the burgomaster’s stone farmhouse. “Used ‘em for cigarette papers,” he said.\n\nIt was still dark when I knocked at the burgomaster’s door. I stood on the doorstep like a bit player in the wings, with the one line I was to deliver banging around an otherwise empty head. The door swung open. “Dolmetscher,” I said.\n\nThe burgomaster himself, old, thin, and nightshirted, ushered me into the first-floor bedroom which was to be mine. He pantomimed as well as spoke his welcome, and a sprinkling of danke schön was adequate dolmetsching for the time being. I was prepared to throttle further discussion with Ich weiss nicht, was soll es bedeuten, dass ich so traurig bin. This would have sent him padding off to bed, convinced that he had a fluent, albeit shot-full-of-Weltschmerz, Dolmetscher. The stratagem wasn’t necessary. He left me alone to consolidate my resources.\n\nChief among these resources was the mutilated pamphlet. I examined each of its precious pages in turn, delighted by the simplicity of transposing English into German. With this booklet, all I had to do was to run my finger down the left-hand column until I found the English phrase I wanted, and then rattle off the nonsense syllables printed opposite in the right-hand column. “How many grenade launchers have you?” for instance, was Vee feel grenada vairfair habben zee? Impeccable German for “Where are your tank columns?” proved to be nothing more troublesome than Vo zint eara pantzer shpitzen? I mouthed the phrases: “Where are your howitzers? How many machine guns have you? Surrender! Don’t shoot! Where have you hidden your motorcycle? Hands up! What unit are you from?”\n\nThe pamphlet came to an abrupt end, toppling my spirits from manic to depressive. The Pennsylvania Dutchman had smoked up all the rear area pleasantries, comprising the pamphlet’s first half, leaving me with nothing to work with but the repartee of hand-to-hand fighting.\n\nAs I lay sleepless in bed, the one drama in which I could play took shape in my mind. . . .\n\nDOLMETSCHER (to BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER): I don’t know what will become of me, I am so sad. (Embraces her.)\n\nBURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER (with yielding shyness): The air is cool, and it’s getting dark, and the Rhine is flowing quietly.\n\n(DOLMETSCHER seizes BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER, carries her bodily into his room.)\n\nDOLMETSCHER (softly): Surrender.\n\n(Enter BURGOMASTER.)\n\nBURGOMASTER (brandishing Luger): Ach!\n\nHands up!\n\nDOLMETSCHER and BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER: Don’t shoot!\n\n(A Large map, shelving disposition of American First Army, falls from BURGOMASTER’S breast pocket.)\n\nDOLMETSCHER (aside, in English): What is this supposedly pro-Ally Burgomaster doing with a map showing the disposition of the American First Army? (He snatches 45 automatic pistol from beneath pillow and aims at BURGOMASTER.)\n\nBURGOMASTER and BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER: Don’t shoot! (BURGOMASTER drops Luger, cowers, sneers.)\n\nDOLMETSCHER: What unit are you from? (BURGOMASTER remains sullen, silent. BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER goes to his side, weeps softly. DOLMETSCHER pauses significantly, suddenly points at BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTER.) Where have you hidden your motorcycle? (Turns again to Burgomaster.) Where are your howitzers, eh? Where are your tank columns? How many grenade launchers have you?\n\nBURGOMASTER (cracking under terrific grilling): I —\n\n(Enter Guard Detail composed of Pennsylvania Dutchmen, making a routine check just in time to hear BURGOMASTER and BURGOMASTER’S DAUGHTERconfess to being Nazi agents parachuted behind American lines.)\n\nJohann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller couldn’t have done any better with the same words, and they were the only words I had. There was no chance of my muddling through, and no pleasure in being interpreter for a full battalion in December and not being able to say so much as “Merry Christmas.”\n\nI made my bed, tightened the drawstrings on my duffel bag, and stole through the black-out curtains and into the night.\n\nWary sentinels directed me to Battalion Headquarters, where I found most of our officers either poring over maps or loading their weapons. There was a holiday spirit in the air, and the executive officer was honing an eighteen-inch bowie knife and humming Are You from Dixie?\n\n“Well, bless mah soul,”he said, noticing me standing in the door, “here’s old ‘sprecken zee Dutch.’ Speak up, boy. Ain’t you supposed to be ovah at the mayah’s house?”\n\n“It’s no good,” I said. “They all speak Low German, and I speak High.”\n\nThe executive was impressed. “Too good foah ‘em, eh?” He ran his index finger down the edge of his murderous knife. “Ah think we’ll he runnin’ into some who can talk the high-class Kraut putty soon,” he said, and then added, “Weah surrounded.”\n\n“We’ll whomp ‘em the way we whomped ‘em in Nawth Ca’lina and Tennessee,” said the colonel, who had never lost a maneuver. “You stay heah, son. Ah’m gonna want you foah mah pussnel intupretah.”\n\nTwenty minutes later I was in the thick of dolmetsching again. Four Tiger tanks drove up to the front door of Headquarters, and two dozen German infantrymen dismounted to round us up with submachine guns.\n\n“Say sumpin’,” ordered the colonel, spunky to the last.\n\nI ran my eye down the left-hand columns of my pamphlet until I found the phrase which most fairly represented our sentiments. “Don’t shoot,” I said.\n\nA German tank officer swaggered in to have a look at his catch. In his hand was a pamphlet, somewhat smaller than mine. “Where are your howitzers?” he said.",

        "title": "Musk Comes for the ‘Third Rail of American Politics’",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Twenty years ago, President George W. Bush’s second-term honeymoon was ending, and Social Security was to blame. Voters rebelled against his plan to partially privatize the popular retirement program and, the following year, stripped the GOP of its majorities in Congress. The events of 2005 cemented Social Security’s reputation as the “third rail of American politics.” For the next two decades, Republicans didn’t touch it.\n\nPerhaps Elon Musk wasn’t paying attention. Back then, he had yet to vote in a U.S. election (or launch a rocket). Now, as a leader of DOGE, he’s opened an unexpected crusade against Social Security.\n\nMusk recently called the program “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” and claimed that it’s rife with waste and fraud. DOGE staffers have gained entry to the Social Security Administration and obtained sensitive taxpayer data, and the Trump administration has cut the agency’s workforce by thousands. Earlier this week, Social Security officials announced changes that could make it harder for retirees to access their benefits. These moves—and Musk’s rhetoric—have frightened voters, who have jammed congressional phone lines and town-hall meetings to register their concerns. And they’ve alarmed GOP lawmakers, who could pay for Musk’s decisions in next year’s midterms.\n\nRead: The GOP’s fears about Musk are growing\n\nIf Musk wants to meet his goal of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending, he’ll have to do a lot more than eliminate USAID, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and even the Department of Education. He knows the real money is in the three pillars of America’s social safety net: Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. “Most of the federal spending is entitlements,” he said earlier this month. “That’s the big one to eliminate.”\n\nRepublicans have learned that going after these programs carries a huge electoral risk. Musk, apparently, has not. “He doesn’t think politically,” Tom Davis, a former House Republican from Virginia who ran the party’s campaign committee in the early 2000s, told me. His approach, Davis said, is “ready, fire, aim.”\n\nMusk has “been quite successful in business, but he is clearly not very popular, and his DOGE actions are making him less popular,” a senior GOP strategist told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid provoking a fight with the president or his wealthy lieutenant. “He will end up being a heavy weight around the neck of not only President Trump but Republicans generally.”\n\nMost elected Republicans have been careful to avoid criticizing Trump or Musk. But as DOGE has continued to assail Social Security, some have started feeling pressure from their constituents. Callers inundated Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan with concerns about Social Security cuts during a telephone town hall the Republican held earlier this month. He assured them the program would not be touched. “I will admit that there have been times where Elon Musk has tweeted first and thought second,” Huizenga told me, summarizing his message to constituents.\n\nTrump might be able to claim a mandate from voters to justify some of his early cost cutting; he’s long criticized foreign aid, for example. But during the 2024 presidential campaign, he repeatedly vowed to preserve entitlements, even when some in his party wanted to trim them. Republicans have relied on those promises to try to reassure voters that their benefits are safe. “I think President Trump has made it very clear that he does not want to touch Social Security,” Representative Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, a Trump ally, told reporters at the Capitol last week. “We are not cutting Social Security.”\n\nMusk’s offensive against Social Security, however, has made those claims harder to sustain. And Trump himself has amplified some of Musk’s most specious charges about the program. During the president’s address to Congress earlier this month, he said his administration had identified “shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud” in Social Security. But the examples he cited—people born in the 19th century supposedly still getting checks—were almost certainly data-processing errors that reflected the program’s antiquated computer systems, not fraud.\n\nRead: What Trump and Musk want with Social Security\n\nThe administration’s attempts to reduce fraud could jeopardize legitimate recipients. Beginning next month, people will no longer be able to call the Social Security Administration to file for benefits or update their banking information. Instead they’ll have to do so on the agency’s website or—if they can’t verify their identity online—visit an SSA office in person. The new requirements could be a particular hardship for older beneficiaries who live in rural areas—a constituency that leans heavily Republican.\n\n“If they kill the ability to phone Social Security with questions, that will cause real problems with seniors,” the GOP strategist warned. “This would give Democrats an opening.\"\n\nPolling backs up the strategist’s claims. In a survey released yesterday, the Democratic firm Blueprint read respondents a list of 20 different facts about Musk and what he has done with DOGE, then asked which ones they found concerning. The four examples that respondents worried about most all involved possible cuts to Social Security. “This is what Democrats need to get through their heads: It’s all Social Security right now,” Evan Roth Smith, Blueprint’s pollster, told reporters during a briefing.\n\nWhat Trump and Musk are doing now is far different from what Bush proposed two decades ago. His plan called for structural changes to Social Security that would allow recipients to put their benefits into private investment accounts, which Bush argued could yield more earnings for beneficiaries while extending the fiscal solvency of the program. Davis was serving in the House when the public rejected Bush’s idea. He offered a reminder that Trump and Musk might want to consider: “When you move too far, too fast in politics,” Davis said, “the voters pull you back.”",

        "content": "At this year’s South by Southwest festival, in Austin, film premieres weren’t the only major events. The buzziest affair, arguably, took place inside a truck: a facsimile of the Criterion Collection’s fabled office closet, bursting with select editions of its deep and idiosyncratic film catalog. For three minutes each, movie lovers could enter the Criterion Closet truck to rifle through the company’s expansive archive of canonical works, plucking DVD and Blu-ray copies to purchase and take home. Part of the fun is that the experience is captured on video, giving visitors their own personal installment of the beloved “Criterion Closet Picks” YouTube series, which features famous artists explaining their favorite selections.\n\nThe hundreds of festivalgoers waiting their turn suggest a draw beyond the physical pleasures of picking out and buying a handful of Criterion films, though. The real appeal of the Criterion Closet is emotional. It’s a place to let your movie obsessions—your obscure taste, your love of cult classics, your knowledge of directorial deep cuts—run wild and then be recognized for them.\n\nBob Stein co-founded the Criterion Collection in 1984 with the modest goal of releasing contemporary and classic films on home video. He dressed them up with stunning dust jackets and booklets, and they came with special features such as audio commentaries. Over the following decades, Criterion’s catalog expanded from a few hundred entries on LaserDisc to more than 1,600 across DVD and Blu-ray. The brand is now synonymous with an impressive swath of cinema: films that are challenging and avant-garde; that were once maligned but have developed loyal followings; that threatened to be lost to time.\n\nAt one point, the New York–based company needed storage for its growing stockpile. The discs ended up in a humble supply closet in the office, which has since become both an archival treasure trove and a destination for those in the know. In 2010, Criterion began uploading videos to YouTube of the most notable people to peruse the closet’s offerings: filmmakers, actors, other influential cultural figures. Viewers can now watch well-known names such as the director John Waters, the philosopher Slavoj Žižek, and the actor Zoë Kravitz gleefully traipse through this cinephile’s Candyland, given free rein to pick through the extensive library. As they talk about why a particular selection intrigues them, the famous visitors flash the disc covers at the camera. Inevitably, they leave with an armful of DVDs, composed of films they love and others they want to see; the complete list is revealed at the video’s end.\n\nRead: A streaming service for cinephiles\n\nThe “Closet Picks” videos have helped Criterion grow “from a more insular, cinephile-first cult favorite to a more mass phenomenon,” as GQ noted in a story about the series last year. The most popular installments garner hundreds of thousands of views and generate viral clips in part because of their savvy choice of featured guests. It’s not unusual for an actor or a director to appear while promoting their latest film, yet fail to mention it—they’re too dazzled by all the beautiful DVDs.\n\nInstead, the joy of watching the series lies in the visitors’ authentic, unvarnished delight. Take the actor Ayo Edebiri’s entry, from July; the Bear actor’s love of film is well documented, and in her video, she buzzes with anticipation, immediately addressing viewers who she knows would feel similarly upon entering the closet: “I’m on these sales,” she says, referencing Criterion’s frequent discounts. “I’m getting these 50 percent off DVDs, just like you are.” Edebiri brings along a list of her intended picks, including the black comedy To Sleep With Anger and the heist thriller Thief—two wildly different choices that speak to her wide-ranging tastes. Hundreds of posters on Reddit and YouTube expressed how much they could envision themselves as the ecstatic star, right down to her outfit: “Between the prepared list on her phone and the Radiohead t-shirt I feel like this was the closest the comments section has been to having one of us in the closet,” reads one YouTube reply.\n\nThe videos, at their best, help transform famous figures into more personable ones. The directors Josh and Benny Safdie almost can’t get the words out quickly enough as they rhapsodize about Mike Leigh’s harrowing dramedy Meantime and recall how Charlie Chaplin’s silent-era masterpiece The Kid made Benny cry. Their trip to the closet, in a way, gives new context to the Safdie brothers’ work, as viewers realize that the makers of the stress-inducing black comedy Uncut Gems are in fact goofy, sincere film nerds.\n\nMany guests also approach the Criterion Closet as if it’s a hallowed institution. The actor Gael García Bernal veers into philosophical territory with his choices; when he grabs the Italian neorealist triumph Blow-Up, he discusses how its themes of surveillance and paranoia resonate with him. He relates his yearning for the era before cellphones and the idle time that came with it, a wistful and humanizing admission.\n\nThe “Closet Picks” series lets these textured portraits emerge from visitors and viewers alike. The comment sections have cultivated a community of discerning movie lovers, filled with people sharing their takes on each guest’s picks. They mimic the warmth of video stores, those communal spaces where like-minded cinephiles could congregate and bond by debating the best Alfred Hitchcock movies or gushing over auteurs such as Akira Kurosawa and John Carpenter. The fervor around the video series and the Closet truck underscores, ultimately, how few offline places there are today for movie lovers to come together.\n\nThe Criterion Closet is, in some ways, an exclusive club; you need to be invited to the company’s office, which typically means being a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry. Yet “Closet Picks” manages to convey the thrill that comes with discovering great art, as well as those who share your love for it. The series does something potent with something very simple: When we see a person we admire geek out over cinema’s transformative power, they’re revealing how they came to see the world—and how we all might fit into it.",

        "content": "This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nPeter greeted me in the mostly empty gravel parking lot of a Mennonite church on the outskirts of Seminole, a small city in West Texas surrounded by cotton and peanut fields. The brick building was tucked in a cobbled-together neighborhood of scrapyards, metal barns, and modest homes with long dirt driveways. No sign out front advertised its name; no message board displayed a Bible verse. No cross, no steeple—nothing, in fact, that would let a passerby know they had stumbled on a place of worship. When my car pulled up, Peter emerged to find out who I was.\n\nHe hadn’t been expecting a stranger with a notepad, but he listened as I explained that I had come to town to write about the measles outbreak, which had by that point sent 20 people from the area to the hospital and caused the death of an unnamed child, the disease’s first victim in the United States in a decade.\n\nOf course Peter knew why Seminole was in the news. He had heard that President Trump was asked about the outbreak here during a Cabinet meeting, and he told me that he didn’t like the attention. The Mennonites were being unjustly singled out. It wasn’t like they were the only ones who came down with measles. The coverage, he insisted, was “100 percent unfair.” He didn’t think it was just the Seminole area that had problems; he said that he had family in Canada and Mexico who had also gotten measles recently. I told him I’d heard that the child who’d passed away might have come from his congregation. He said that was true.\n\nPeter dug the toe of his boot into the gravel. I asked him if he knew the family. His voice broke slightly as he answered. “That’s our kid,” he said.\n\nPhotograph by Jake Dockins\n\nThe first case in the West Texas outbreak was announced on January 29. The official tally in the region grew to six over the next week. By Valentine’s Day, it was up to 48. On February 26, news went out that a child had died; by that point, 124 cases had been confirmed across nine counties, making the outbreak the largest that the state had seen in 30 years. The official count now stands at just about 200, and another person who was diagnosed with measles just died across the border in New Mexico.\n\nAn outbreak—even one this big—should not have come as a surprise. Vaccination rates have dipped in many states, including Texas, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. In Gaines County, where Seminole is located, the measles-vaccination rate among kindergartners is just 82 percent, well short of the estimated 95 percent threshold for maintaining herd immunity. Even that alarming figure would appear to undersell the local problem. Many children from the county’s Mennonite community, which numbers in the thousands, are unvaccinated, but they won’t get picked up in state tallies, because they are either homeschooled or enrolled in nonaccredited private schools, which are not required to collect such data.\n\nPhotograph by Jake Dockins\n\nEven in the midst of a measles crisis, persuading parents in rural West Texas to vaccinate their children, or just to get tested for the virus, is an uphill battle. Zach Holbrooks, the executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, told me that he’s spent the past month trying to get the word out, particularly to the Low German–speaking Mennonite community. He asked three local churches if he could set up a mobile testing site on their property. They all refused. “I think there’s some sentiment that they’re being targeted,” he said, “and I don’t like the fact that they feel that way.” His team did create a drive-up testing site at a county events building next to the city park, and not far from the Masonic lodge. But he said that it gets very few visitors—about two or three a day. As a result, no one really knows the outbreak’s total size.\n\nRead: America is botching measles\n\nHelp from the federal government has been slow to arrive. Weeks into the outbreak, the Department of Health and Human Services directed 2,000 doses of vaccine to be sent to Texas. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly confirmed HHS secretary, initially reacted to the outbreak by claiming that it was “not unusual.” Since then, he has repeatedly reminded the public that the decision to be immunized is a personal one, even while acknowledging that vaccines “not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity.” He has also claimed that good nutrition might be sufficient to protect people from the worst effects of measles. “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease in modern times,” Kennedy falsely told Fox News’s Marc Siegel in an interview last week. He’d had “a very, very emotional and long conversation” with the family of the child who had died, he said; and later added that “malnutrition may have been an issue in her death.” Local health officials told The New York Times that the child who died had “no known underlying conditions.” A spokesman for HHS declined to comment.\n\nThere are a half dozen Mennonite congregations in Seminole, according to Google Maps. Peter’s church isn’t listed among them. Aside from a nonprofit filing, it does not appear to have any online presence. I knew of its existence only because I’d met a Mennonite man from another congregation at a coffee shop that morning and asked whether he knew the family of the child that had died. He said he’d heard they were from this church. When I asked him where it was, he responded with a word in Low German. That turned out to be a nickname for a neighborhood a little ways outside of town. After circling county roads for a while, passing a mix of homes, horses, and farm equipment, I stopped and asked for help from a group of boys playing in a field with rocks and sticks. They pointed in unison. The church was just half a mile up the road.\n\nThat’s where I encountered Peter, a wiry 28-year-old man with an angular face who wore a dark-colored, Western-style shirt and jeans. His English was uncertain, and he spoke with a light German accent. Sometimes he responded to my questions with silence.\n\nHe declined to reveal his daughter’s name or the family’s last name. Peter was perplexed by the national news coverage, and he did not seem eager to draw more attention to his family and community. He gave only his daughter’s age: She was 6 years old. When I asked him to describe her in more detail, he waved his hand, said she liked what other kids liked. But as we stood in the parking lot, he told me the story of what happened.\n\nPeter’s daughter had been sick for three weeks. The family knew it was measles. He said they took her to the hospital at one point, and she was given cough medicine. “That’s it,” he recalled. “They just say, ‘Go home.’ They don’t want to help us. They say, ‘It’s just normal; go home.’” (A spokeswoman for the Seminole Hospital District declined to comment, citing privacy laws.)\n\nPhotograph by Jake Dockins\n\nIt wasn’t normal, though. Her condition continued to deteriorate, so they brought her back to the doctors. “She just kept getting sicker and sicker,” he told me. “Her lungs plugged up.” Her heart rate and blood pressure dropped, and the doctors put her on a ventilator. “We were there Saturday ’til Monday, three days … and then it was worse, very bad.” Peter shook his head and stared at the ground. He said his daughter died on Tuesday night from pneumonia, which is a common infection in severe measles cases.\n\nPeter’s daughter was not vaccinated. Mennonite doctrine does not prohibit inoculations or modern medicine in general, though I encountered plenty of suspicion among Mennonites I spoke with in Seminole. I met a father who said that he wanted to vaccinate his two daughters but that their mother didn’t think it was a good idea. A grandmother told me she knew of several children who had been given the measles vaccine and were “never the same after that.” A man who'd spent his career installing irrigation equipment said he was suspicious of vaccines in part because he believed that the government had lied about the origins of COVID.\n\nPeter said that he has doubts about vaccines too. He told me that he considers getting measles a normal part of life, noting that his parents and grandparents had it. “Everybody has it,” he told me. “It’s not so new for us.” He’d also heard that getting measles might strengthen your immune system against other diseases, a view Kennedy has promoted in the past. But perhaps most of all, Peter worried about what the vaccine might do to his children. “The vaccination has stuff we don’t trust,” he said. “We don’t like the vaccinations, what they have these days. We heard too much, and we saw too much.”\n\n“They just say ‘Go home.’ They don’t want to help us. They say, ‘It’s just normal; go home.”\n\nDuring our conversation, several families arrived and went inside the building behind him. Mennonites are known for coming to the aid of fellow community members. Earlier in my visit, I’d heard a story about how Mennonites had paid off the mortgage of a young mother in the area whose husband had died in an accident. I asked Peter if he was getting enough support. He nodded: “Food, money—whatever we need.” Peter does construction for a living. He and his wife have four other small children. A couple of them appeared as we talked, grabbing at his sleeve, trying to get his attention. He leaned down to reassure them.\n\nThe death of his daughter, Peter told me, was God’s will. God created measles. God allowed the disease to take his daughter’s life. “Everybody has to die,” he said. Peter’s eyes closed, and he struggled to continue talking. “It’s very hard, very hard,” he said at last. “It’s a big hole.” His voice quavered and trailed off. “Our child is here,” he said, gesturing toward the building behind him. “That’s why we’re here.”\n\nPeter invited me to come inside the church building. He walked over to the door and held it open. I entered a small, dark, airless room with about a dozen chairs. Peter’s daughter was lying in the middle in a handmade coffin covered with fabric. Her face, framed by blond, braided pigtails, showed no sign of illness. Everything was white: her skin, her dress, the lining of her coffin, the thin ribbons that formed little bows on the cuffs of her sleeves. Her hands were clasped just below her chest. Members of her family were seated all around. No one looked up when I walked into the room. The only sounds were the trill of someone’s cellphone alert and the dry, hacking cough coming from one of her sisters in the corner.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss statistics, to forget what they represent. Before the measles shot was introduced in 1963, the number of deaths caused by the disease in the United States each year was somewhere from 400 to 500. The CDC puts the mortality rate for childhood measles at one to three in 1,000, with one in five cases requiring hospitalization. Thanks to vaccines, the memory of that suffering has largely faded from public consciousness, at least in the developed world.\n\nWhat happened in Seminole, though, was a grim reminder. The day after meeting Peter, I visited the vaccination clinic across the street from the hospital where he had first taken his daughter. I had planned to interview people who were there to get their shots, but no one showed. It occurred to me that I was now at some modest risk myself. Families from Peter’s church had cycled through the visitation service the day before, sharing air inside that stuffy room amid their grief. Like a lot of people born before 1989, I’d gotten only one measles shot as a kid, so out of an abundance of caution, I rolled up my sleeve and got a booster. Later that day, I met up with Zach Holbrooks for lunch and asked him how many other people had gotten shots that morning. It turned out to be just one, and that one was him. He, too, had received just a single dose of the vaccine in childhood, so it seemed wise to get another.\n\nPhotograph by Jake Dockins\n\nAfter lunch, I made the six-hour drive back to Austin, where I live, past the pumpjacks slowly bobbing for oil and the towering wind farms. There’s nothing I heard in Seminole that I haven’t also heard from crunchy liberal friends at home who choose not to vaccinate their kids because they believe that vaccines contain toxins that cause autism or that childhood diseases bolster the immune system. (For the record, the 1998 paper that purported to show a link between vaccines and autism has been retracted, and research indicates that contracting measles can degrade your body’s ability to fight other infections.) Nor are Peter’s views that unusual in conservative corners of the country. A recent poll found that nearly one-third of all Republican and Republican-leaning voters, for instance, think that routine inoculations are “more dangerous than the diseases they are designed to prevent.” That’s the gist of what I heard from multiple Mennonites I interviewed. They are far from alone.\n\nAt one point in the parking lot, Peter had asked me why his daughter matters to the rest of the country. I’d struggled in the moment to come up with an answer. For Peter and his family, the loss of their daughter is a private tragedy, one that would be excruciating no matter how she died. The fact that she died of measles, though, is a sign that something has gone wrong with the country’s approach to public health. Twenty-five years ago, measles was declared “eliminated” in the United States. Now a deadly crisis is unfolding in West Texas.\n\nBefore I left the church that day, Peter and I talked for a few more minutes. “You probably know how it goes when somebody passes away,” he said. “It’s hard to believe.” Peter told me he didn’t have anything more to say. Really, what more could be said? Something unbelievable had happened: A young father was grieving the death of his 6-year-old from measles.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nThe book begins by asking the reader to dream. This particular dream is of a world in which clean, abundant energy flows from nuclear plants and rooftop solar panels; medical advancements have made life better and longer; and artificial intelligence has come not to doom us but to save us from the drudgeries of work. This is the shared vision—part techno-optimism, part liberal reverie—put forth by The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson and The New York Times’ Ezra Klein in their new book, Abundance.\n\nIn their telling, what stands between humanity and this future are not just the usual culprits—conservatives and Big Business—but also liberals. The self-described champions of clean energy, transit, and affordable housing have allowed those goals to fall by the wayside while they prioritize onerous regulations, processes, and a myriad of competing interest groups.\n\nOn today’s episode of Good on Paper, Thompson and Klein join the show to talk about why states like California and New York struggle to achieve the priorities they claim to have. Why is high-speed rail nothing but a dream? Why does Texas build more utility-scale solar than California? Why is New York, a state run by Democrats, unable to tackle its affordable-housing crisis?\n\n“My first book about polarization, Why We’re Polarized, was very much about how polarization, particularly asymmetric polarization on the right, has deranged national politics,” Klein told me. “But I think it’s also important, then, to ask: Well, okay, in the places where liberals govern—you know, California, Illinois, New York—how come I can’t point to that and say, Hey—look at utopia over there?”\n\n“Liberalism should be an advertisement for liberalism,” Thompson added. “Democrats should be able to say, Vote for us, and we’ll make America like California. And instead, Republicans can say, Vote for Democrats, and they’ll turn America into California. They’ll turn America into Portland; they’ll turn America into Oregon.”\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nJerusalem Demsas: The United States is the wealthiest nation on Earth, at a time when the world is richer than it ever has been, and yet our politics are defined by scarcity. Scarcity of housing, of energy, and even of space has allowed zero-sum thinking to permeate the electorate, and that has been a boon for the forces of illiberalism.\n\nDonald Trump rode to victory last November fueled by zero-sum thinking. If there’s not enough to go around, then he’s your man. And now the question is whether the liberal response will be to fight him on his own terms or change the script.\n\nMy name’s Jerusalem Demsas, and this is Good on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives.\n\nIn a new book out today titled Abundance, by The New York Times’ Ezra Klein and The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson, the authors argue for a sea change in how liberals have approached politics. It’s a great book; we’ll put the link in our show notes. And I’m quoting from them here:\n\n“We imagine a future not of less but of more. We do not subscribe to the seductive ideologies of scarcity. We will not get more or better jobs by closing our gates to immigrants. We will not turn back climate change by persuading the world to starve itself of growth. It is not merely that these visions are unrealistic. It is that they are counterproductive. They will not achieve the futures they seek. They will do more harm than good.”\n\nThat paragraph is like catnip for people opposed to Donald Trump, but there are some very difficult intra-coalitional fights that will have to be waged in order for this world of abundance to become reality—because what’s standing in the way of abundant housing, transportation networks, and renewable energy is not only Republicans in Washington, D.C., but Democrats in California, New York, Massachusetts, and beyond.\n\nIt is Democrats who have stood up policies and practices that have allowed scarcity to fester in their own states, fueling a cost-of-living crisis unparalleled in Republican-led jurisdictions.\n\nHere to talk to me about this are the authors of Abundance. Ezra, Derek, welcome to the show!\n\nEzra Klein: Thank you. Good to be here.\n\nDerek Thompson: Great to be here, Jerusalem.\n\nDemsas: You guys co-wrote a book, and in the book, you write “our” and “we” a lot. And I had a fun time playing mini detective, trying to decipher which parts felt more Derek and which ones felt more Ezra. But what were some places of disagreement you discovered while writing the book? Are there ways you think differently about the problems of scarcity, Derek?\n\nThompson: I don’t think we disagree in the conclusions of the book, but I do think that our approaches are different. I think that I’ve never really been a politics-first writer or a politics-first podcaster. And when I wrote the original abundance-agenda essay, that was me dipping my toe into politics.\n\nAnd I’ve always felt a little bit more comfortable starting with economics or technology and then working my way into politics. And so I think that working with Ezra, who is so much more versed in modern politics and political history, was really educational in terms of thinking about many of the ideas that I debuted in that abundance-agenda essay as firmly political issues.\n\nAnd I think that as we worked together and talked on the phone and read each other’s drafts, there was a theme that’s not present in that original abundance essay, really very much at all, that we began to see as being absolutely essential for this book, which is the theme of: If you’re going to remake liberalism for the next generation, you have to take very seriously the shortcomings of liberalism in the previous generation. And that, for me, just speaking entirely personally, is something that absolutely emerged in conversations with Ezra, rather than appeared initially in my first conception of an abundance book about progress.\n\nSo that’s, I think, one place where it’s not so much a matter of disagreement as a matter of, sort of, our differences in approach leading to what I think is a very fruitful combination.\n\nKlein: So I think you can really see the differences between Derek and my approach if you just look at the titles of our two original essays here. So Derek, as he mentioned, had this great piece on abundance, and, you know, the framing of that is so sunny and optimistic, and everybody’s for abundance. And my piece was called “The Economic Mistake the Left Is Finally Confronting,” and I called it “supply-side progressivism.”\n\nAnd in that way, I think one of the really great things about working together on this is that Derek brings, I think, a forward-looking, sunnier optimism. And I bring a somewhat hard-nosed, Where the fuck did all this policy go wrong? you know, jaded-policy-reporter sense that I think creates a book that has the two sides of the coin that it needs.\n\nDemsas: Despite growing up on the East Coast—I feel like I’ve said this to Derek a bunch of times—he’s, like, the most West Coast East Coaster I’ve ever met, just perennially optimistic about the future.\n\nKlein: Sure. (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: In a way, that just seems super wrong. But, Ezra, you’re actually from the West Coast, so it’s like you’re switching.\n\nKlein: I’m the West Coaster, which is why I’m so pissed, because I was in California while doing all this work and thinking about why California was performing so terribly, despite being the greatest state the world has ever known.\n\nDemsas: So I’m going to ask you to harness some of that anger now, Ezra. So who are the roadblocks to abundant housing, clean energy, transportation, and tech innovation? Give me a villain.\n\nKlein: Just a nice, small question there.\n\nDemsas: Yes, exactly.\n\nKlein: Well, they’re different in the different areas. I think that’s one thing to say.\n\nBut I’ve thought about the set of roadblocks here as in different categories. So one is interests. You can think about trying to build an affordable-housing complex in San Francisco, and you get interests that are lined up against it for different reasons.\n\nSo one set of interests might be local homeowners who do not want a six-story affordable-housing complex down the block from them. They think it’ll hurt their parking. They think it will bring people they don’t want to the neighborhood. They think it’ll hurt their home values. So that’s very classic. Then you might have—depending on how this is built, you might have—unions, right? If the complex does not want to use union labor or does not want to pay prevailing wages, or they want to do modular construction off-site—as in one of the examples I reported on—you might have unions begin to fight that. You also have, just in general then, what I think of as policy drift. So there are certain programs, procedures, approaches that came into being at one time, maybe without anybody even really noticing it, and they become binding and difficult over time, but nobody’s ever revisited.\n\nSo again, holding on to the affordable-housing example, there is this kind of strange process in San Francisco—it was in California, I guess, but this specifically in San Francisco—around this thing called 14, I think, B or D; I forget which one. It began life as a racial preference. So it was meant to give the—in city contracts, you would have a preference for minority-owned contractors. Then the California Supreme Court—or no. I’m sorry. It was actually a proposition. California voters said, You can’t do that.\n\nSo then they went back, and the state, the city of San Francisco edited that procedure. And they said, Now it’s for small businesses and subcontractors, micro subcontractors, right? We, in San Francisco, have a rooting interest in making sure we have a healthy small-business ecosystem, and so there’s going to be a preference here for small businesses over big contractors, either in the city of San Francisco or even coming in from the outside.\n\nAnd everybody kind of knows that, in terms of how the city looks at it, it’s still sort of also a racial preference, if you can get there. But specifically, in language, it is a small-business preference. Most people just don’t know that’s there. That’s not really interests—I mean, small subcontractors do. But in general, that’s not a well-known thing. It’s not even doing the thing it was initially intended to do. So just over time, it’s become more binding. It’s drifted. It’s become a kind of procedural crust that I think would not be passed into law today if somebody was thinking about it. So that’s another one.\n\nThen you have sort of overlapping and complex authorities. You get this a lot in environmental issues. So, like, when you’re dealing with transmission lines, the number of players who have to sign off on something: Sometimes it’s local; sometimes it’s state. There’s overlapping federal authorities. That’s really difficult. You have very fractured authority. Nobody can consistently make the decision. So you begin to just have sort of category after category of things that, when you stack them, it just makes it very, very hard to get anything done.\n\nBut they’re not all ideological. They’re not all interest based. They’re not all anything. It is the problem of, as Steve Teles once called it, like, a “kludgeocracy” that has evolved over, you know, many decades.\n\nThompson: Let me jump in there. I think Ezra provided a really nice zoom-out answer from the local individual level to the higher-level factions and groups, starting with voters and homeowners, moving to economic factions, moving to the regulatory and legislative drift that exists in the laws and rules that are written, and then the overlapping authorities.\n\nI do want to introduce here the most macro answer to your question, Jerusalem, Who’s standing in the way of progress? Sometimes, it’s just the federal government, and I think it’s sometimes the federal government, in terms of the way that a lot of these policies that seem to be policies that would forward progressive ends end up stymieing progressive ends. There’s an incredible echo of that story that’s unfolded in the rollout of broadband-internet construction across the country after the Biden infrastructure bill.\n\nAnd so the top-line headline that I think a lot of people read in the Politico article, or other articles about the slow rollout of broadband construction, is that Biden authorized $42 billion to build broadband internet, and just a fraction of that money was spent, because of the paperwork required.\n\nBut why wasn’t the money spent? Why didn’t we actually do what we wanted to do? And I was asking people about this at a dinner that I went to recently, where everything was on background and not for attribution. But, you know, suffice it to say that people at this dinner had job titles that made it very clear that their testimony was highly relevant to the question of why it was hard to build rural broadband in this country when the government put $42 billion behind the effort.\n\nAnd their answer was: It wasn’t so much about the language of the legislation as the funding rules published by the Commerce Department that had workforce requirements and pricing requirements and climate-change requirements and bidding requirements, and so on and so on. And so essentially, you have the federal government saying, On the one hand, here’s federal money. Go forth and achieve a Democratic initiative, which is raising living standards for low-income Americans. I mean, just the most classic bread-and-butter progressive initiative. But also, they made the application process so onerous that nothing was built. And so, in fact, very little was actually done on behalf of the Americans for whom we wanted to raise their living standards.\n\nAnd I think this is a question that goes to—and this is a theme throughout, I think, Ezra’s answer—trade-offs in policy making and taking those trade-offs seriously. I think climate change is an important thing to care about. I don’t want the state of Virginia taking, say, federal money to build broadband internet and then charging poor rural folks, like, $200 a month to go online.\n\nBut by holding those values so closely and creating an application and funding process that extended the time that those authorized dollars were actually spent by two, three, three-and-a-half years, we accidentally built just about nothing. And now the entire program looks like it might just be, like, block granted to Elon Musk Inc. so he can do Starlink for America.\n\nSo this is what happens, I think, when at the federal level you also have this confusion of process versus outcomes, of wanting to fit everything in Ezra’s everything bagel into the process such that every you’ve stymied your ability to actually achieve the outcomes that you’ve indicated.\n\nDemsas: In both of your answers, I hear, and I think many people will hear, a critique that conservatives and libertarians have been making for a long time. From Ezra, I’m hearing, you know, there are too many interest groups that are demanding that their priorities be preferenced over the outcomes that benefit a broad number of people. And from Derek, I’m hearing pretty straightforwardly that government is standing in the way, that regulations are standing in the way, that process is standing in the way of free enterprise, of government. And in the book, you have, like, heavy citation of Mancur Olson’s work. And what distinguishes your project from the conservative kind of critique of liberalism? Is that—are you just trying to lib-wash conservatism?\n\nKlein: Goals.\n\nDemsas: Yeah?\n\nKlein: Goals, very simply. Which red state has decarbonized? Which red state is even trying? Which red state has high-speed rail? Which red state is even trying?\n\nI hear this sometimes from people, and I always think it’s weird. I always think it’s libertarians and conservatives so underselling their own project. Their project isn’t just deregulation. In many cases, they’re adding lots of new powers. Right? Like, look at their relationship to the surveillance state. Their project is to actually do things. It’s to gut Medicare and Medicaid because they feel that it is an unwise use of money to spend all that money on health insurance for poor people and the elderly.\n\nTheir project is to actively impede the construction of solar and wind [power], as we see the Trump administration doing right now. I was thinking about your question a second ago, Jerusalem, and thinking that the much cleaner answer I should have given was the villain is liberals in government who’ve oriented towards process and not outcome. The enemy is people who have said they’re going to deliver something, who believe in delivering that thing, and then have accepted process in which they do not end up delivering it, and then they explain it away, or explain away how hard they worked.\n\nBut by the way, this is how all the coalitions work. What is ultimately meaningful is outcome—the kind of world you are trying to live in, the kind of world you are trying to build. When Elon Musk and DOGE go in and decapitate USAID and cut off that funding, what they are doing, their outcome, their intention, their aim, their goal is not deregulation or cutting the federal workforce a little bit. Their aim is to stop delivering aid to poor people. That is what they believe that “America first” means: You do not spend our money preventing HIV/AIDS from infecting children in Africa. I think that’s monstrous. But that’s the aim. That’s the goal. And the means—decapitating USAID is the means to the goal.\n\nSo the difference between, I think, Derek and I, and conservatives and libertarians, is that we have different outcomes we’re trying to reach. I don’t think it makes sense for me and Donald Trump’s Department of Energy lead to debate how best to decarbonize, because he doesn’t want to decarbonize. Right? So I’ll have different things to do from that.\n\nDemsas: But does that matter? Because, I mean—\n\nKlein: Yeah.\n\nDemsas: No, but, I mean: in terms of the outcomes that you’re talking about here. So, I mean, in the book, you even cite this, but in response to your question about whether Texas has decarbonized: No, but they’re sure as hell siting a bunch of renewable energy. And when we talk about high-speed rail, I wouldn’t call it the highest-speed rail, but Brightline is reviving passenger rail in Florida; it might be reviving passenger rail in Nevada. It’s possible that Texas might even be given the opportunity to do high-speed rail now.\n\nI mean, there’s ways in which I, as a liberal myself, hear this all the time. And I struggle with this question because these places, despite their lack of interest in many of the goals that the three of us may have, are still executing on these goals.\n\nKlein: Yeah. I think that speaks to the power of defaults. And, I mean, we talk about this in the book. I mean, we cite specifically that Texas is building—and by the way, so is Georgia—a lot of renewable energy, but that’s because the default in Texas is to build things very easily. And so when the market sees an opportunity to make money building things—which, particularly under the IRA, it’s seen a very big opportunity to make money building renewable energy—it’ll be able to build it there, because they’ve simply made it straightforward. Although it is a question, I think, how long that would last for. You see a lot of political efforts in the Texas legislature to make it harder to build renewable energy.\n\nAnd now you see at the Trump level a lot of efforts to destroy the solar and, specifically, the wind industries, right? They’re actually trying to make that actively harder. So I think over time, there might be a lag before policy catches up with politics, but typically they do eventually begin to align on, you know, efficiently or inefficiently. You know, there are other things where Texas has just, like, way better affordable housing than California does, but conservatives don’t oppose affordable housing.\n\nSo I do think it’s absolutely true that you have places where there is a default, a path dependence that has made things happen even when you wouldn’t really expect it from a policy architecture. And in many ways, you know, probusiness conservatives should probably look at California and ask, Well, why does California dominate technologically to the extent that it does, given that you all seem to think your low taxes and your probusiness environments are so much better? Why aren’t any of these new AI companies located there? Why are they in California and not in Texas, and not in Oklahoma, and not in Florida?\n\nAnd some of that is California. But some of that is things that have been going on there for a long time. So the default is very, very, very strong. But that’s more how I look at that. Like, I think you should, as a liberal, look at how much easier it is to build renewable energy in Texas, and feel ashamed and try to change things. But I don’t think in the long run you will get liberal outcomes through conservative government, and you will not get the reverse. You will not get conservative outcomes through liberal government.\n\nThompson: I’ll pick up where Ezra left off, and then I’ll wind it back to your question, Jerusalem. I think it’s fantastic that Texas builds so much housing. I think it’s fantastic that Texas sites so much solar energy and has so much wind power. That’s a wonderful outcome for Texas and scale to be a wonderful outcome for America. But you know who doesn’t seem to recognize that? Our national libertarians and, more importantly, conservatives, right? Donald Trump could have run on the message, Let’s make America like Texas. Let’s build more solar. Let’s build more wind. Let’s build more housing.\n\nBut instead, despite the fact that he was lofted to power by, I think, in many ways, lots of frustration and furious anger about the state of housing in America, what is his housing agenda? He’s raising tariffs on essential housing materials that come from Canada and Mexico. He’s certainly doing nothing to help the construction industry, which is 25 percent foreign born, meet the demand that is absolutely going to be necessary to catch up with the housing deficit that we’ve built up over the last 20 years.\n\nSo while, yes, I think we should give Texas credit for the fact that its defaults lead, in many cases, to outcomes that liberals would want, it is not at all clear that at the national-politics level, this has trickled up into some kind of positive vision for how to remake America in a way that would help liberal ends. In fact, I think in many ways, it’s the opposite. And it brings us right back to, I think, Ezra’s great first answer to your question.\n\nThe difference between us and libertarians, and certainly the conservatives, is a positive vision of America. And I think it’s cool that this book starts off with, in maybe a little bit of a surprising way, a sci-fi vision of what America in 2050 might look like if we got everything right.\n\nWhat would clean-energy superabundance look like? What would AI look like? What would clean supersonic travel look like, and how would that change people’s lives? How could we eliminate so much of the suffering that’s been the result of chosen scarcities over the last 20 years by fixing it in the next 25?\n\nSo this book, in a very clear way that I don’t think you would see in a lot of conservative manifestos, starts with a very clear vision of a future that I think is unembarrassed about the degree to which its priorities are progressive. But I do think that the processes that progressives have built up over the last 50 years get in the way of making that future buildable.\n\nDemsas: So I absolutely loved the intro that you all wrote. As a sci-fi reader, I just felt completely immersed in that dreamworld. I want to ask you, though, about— there’s a sense in the book that many of the roadblocks to abundance are almost unwitting, right?\n\nLike, you talk about environmental regulations from a past era that were developed to block highways and pipelines, and to clean up the air and water, but are now, unfortunately, blocking solar power and transmission lines and affordable housing. Or that procedural rules—the ones that, you know, Ezra and Derek, you both outlined—are meant to prevent corruption and are, instead, preventing getting contracting done quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut, you know, here’s a place that I struggle because that’s a really, like, friendly story to liberals. It’s a story like, you know, You made a mistake. You know, now it’s time to fix it now that, you know, we’re pointing it out to you. But there are a lot of pieces of evidence that indicate people are not unwitting; they simply disagree. I’m sure you’ve come across this in your reporting, but, you know, there are environmental-justice advocates that have been loud critics of carbon-capture-and-storage technologies, who are fine arguing, to quote, “We simply cannot replace Big Oil with Big Renewable.”\n\nAnother example is Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who is actively undermining her most successful affordable-housing program because it was too good at getting housing built, and is layering on a bunch of process onto a very successful affordable-housing program because of complaints that it was actually siting multifamily housing.\n\nSo how much is this a story of liberals just, you know, We have laws and procedures that were well meaning from another era, versus there being a lot of liberals who simply disagree with these goals, even if they’re not willing to say it explicitly?\n\nKlein: I don’t think the story we tell is that it’s just unwitting. I mean, I quote you in the book, Jerusalem, in the housing chapter about the way in which part of the difficulty in building enough housing is that there is an ineradicable tension between making housing a core financial asset and building enough of it—because financial assets, valuable ones, become more valuable in conditions of scarcity. And so there is good reason for people who already live on a block where the housing, you know, is going up and up and up to not want to see that block suddenly get a very large apartment building in it.\n\nNow, there is a kind of alley-oop between the overhang of past legislation, statute, regulation, process, and some of those interests. I don’t think—in fact, I think I tell: I think the story is pretty clear that when California passed the California Environmental Quality Act under [then-Governor Ronald] Reagan—under Reagan—and nobody thought it was a very big deal, and the LA Times didn’t devote a single, sole article to its passage. And then, only later, after a series of court cases, did it apply not just to government projects but to any project requiring government permitting, which is sort of every project, actually, in California.\n\nSo all of a sudden, it becomes a much bigger deal than it was when it passed. And now it becomes a tool to stop housing, not just to do what the legislature initially intended. Well, then that’s different, right? You have a sort of union, then, between a bill that maybe you could not have passed under that argument, but now interests that have learned how to use that bill to follow their current interests.\n\nSo I don’t think—I mean, I would say that if I’ve given anybody the view that I don’t think this is going to be a series of unbelievably bloody fights in liberalism, I apologize. But I don’t actually think that’s the nature of the book. We do try to have a relatively optimistic tone throughout, and we do try to be understanding, because I do believe this to be true—and so does Derek, I think—that much of what was built in past statute-wise, much of what was built in the ’60s and ’70s was built for good reasons. Many of the things we need to unwind today were not villainous constructions. They were thoughtful responses to problems of another era that do not fit our current era.\n\nOne of the lines I like that we have is: Institutional renewal is a task that faces every generation anew. You can’t expect all the institutions and laws and bills and processes from 40 years ago or 50 years ago to fit the moment you’re in. But it’s just, I think, not the case. And I’ve been part of a lot of these fights already that that we’re particularly naive about whether or not people are protecting their interests here. Of course, they are.\n\nThompson: The origin of zoning and the origin of these environmental rules was absolutely inextricably bound up, in many cases, with pure, old-fashioned racism and a kind of selfishness for which neither I nor Ezra have any patience. I mean, Yoni Appelbaum in his book, Stuck, I think very clearly sets out the case that the first zoning laws in California in the 19th century were rather explicitly about finding legal ways to oppress and segregate and ghettoize the Chinese population after the Gold Rush.\n\nI mean, there’s no question that many of these rules have explicitly racist aims—had explicitly racist aims. And when you look at the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s, for all of the objective good that it did—I think you’ve written about the fact—some people used the overhang of environmentalism to essentially just be people against people.\n\nAnd it’s no accident, I think, that Rachel Carson’s book and [Robert] Caro’s book also happened to come out at the same time that [Paul] Ehrlich wrote The Population Bomb. And a lot of environmentalism in the 1960s and 1970s was in cases of fear of and an almost aversion to the idea of masses of people living on this planet. And we have no patience for, certainly, the most racist and hateful aspects of those laws from 60 and 70 years ago.\n\nThat said, I do think that it is true that some liberals today are simply antibusiness in a way that’s I’m not antibusiness. But I also think that it’s important to be fair to the environmental movement that came up in the 1960s and 1970s by pointing out that it was trying to solve problems that, in many cases, we don’t see in the same way today, because those problems were, in many cases, solved.\n\nThe air was disgusting in the 1950s. The rivers were disgusting in the 1950s. The amount of pollution that came out of tailpipes was freaking gross. And we passed a set of rules with the Clean Air [Act] and [Clean] Water Act and all sorts of other laws and regulations that cleaned up the air and cleaned up the water so that every time someone inhales in order to criticize environmentalism today, they are blessed by the fact that the air they inhale is cleaner as a result of the movement that they’re criticizing.\n\nBut to Ezra’s point, institutional renewal is the job of every generation, and we have allowed, I think, in many cases, wise rules that answered problems in the 20th century to become a disease of the 21st century, which is the inability to build in ways that would actually solve those problems, especially when it comes to, you know, rules like NEPA getting in the way of citing and constructing clean-energy technology.\n\nSo I want to be fair to what I took to be the thrust of your question, which is that, yeah, there were a lot of nauseous pieces of this ideology as it came up. But I also want to be fair to the fact that the environmentalist movement had very serious problems to respond to, in many ways solved lots of the problems they intended to solve. But now we’re left with the overhang. We haven’t done institutional renewal in this generation, and it’s time.\n\nDemsas: So both of you have touched on this a little bit in your answers, but the book is pretty explicitly written to liberals. You write, clearly, quote, “We don’t see ourselves as effective messengers to the right.”\n\nI wonder if you can talk a little bit about your decision to make that so clear. I mean, there are a lot of books where you can implicitly tell that it’s written to a specific audience. But, you know, the YIMBY movement, the Yes In My Backyard movement, has been really, really focused on trying to maintain bipartisanship and not cast the housing-abundance element of this as being a problem just for Democrats to focus on. And you, in your book, of course, cite this as well. So why is this book written for the left?\n\nKlein: I think you have to, in any writing project, decide what your problem that you’re trying to solve is. And, you know, Derek and I probably have different versions of this, but for me, some of the genesis of writing this book was simply what has gone wrong in California. California’s my state. I love it. And in California, every statewide elected official is a Democrat.\n\nYou had to sort of—my first book about polarization, Why We’re Polarized, was very much about how polarization, particularly asymmetric polarization on the right, has deranged national politics. But I think it’s also important, then, to ask: Well, okay, in the places where liberals govern—you know, California, Illinois, New York—how come I can’t point to that and say, Hey—look at utopia over there? You know, like, It’s going great. So that’s one dimension. I mean, there’s actually just a question for me I was trying to answer.\n\nAlthough, I will say, then, to the other side of it, I think that people on the right are going to get a lot out of this book. And I think in some ways, the decision to focus this as a kind of conversation among different flavors of people on the left will make it a little bit easier for them to hear it. Now, it’s going to come into this context of Donald Trump and Elon Musk and J. D. Vance and Russell Vought trying to destroy the federal government. So the right’s got its own sort of questions it’s going to need to figure out.\n\nBut in terms of state-level issues, in terms of, you know, affordable housing, I think there’s a funny dynamic right now around YIMBYism particularly, where, look—the YIMBYs, they want to be bipartisan, but they arose in California, right? That has always been, in its initial incarnation, a movement that is different flavors of Democrats talking to each other. But they have had a bigger effect, I think, in some ways, on red states than on blue ones, because as much as their intellectual victory has happened among liberals of different sorts—you heard, you know, Kamala Harris promising 3 million new homes and Barack Obama talking about the DNC—like, as we both know, as we all know, there’s not a housing-supply increase in San Francisco, where YIMBYism really begins. There’s not a housing-supply increase in California.\n\nLike, I was just looking at FRED data for private housing starts over the past 10 years, and it is lower in January 2025 than it was in January of 2015. On the other hand, Montana has put forward great YIMBY policies, right? Florida and Miami, in particular, have done some really, really good things. And I don’t want to take away. Like, there was a good upzoning in Gowanus, in New York City. The “City of Yes” policies in New York, I think, are promising.\n\nBut I do think sometimes other coalitions can look without having to activate all their internal defenses at a fight happening on the other side and think, Okay, what can we learn from that? So I think our hope is to have constructive conversations with people on the right, as well. But specifically because a lot of this book is about achieving liberal goals, it just, I think, didn’t make sense to try to say that the problems were going to be the same everywhere, because a lot of the things that the right is doing that I don’t like, they’re doing it because they want a world I don’t want. And telling them they’re wrong to be doing it then doesn’t make a ton of sense.\n\nThompson: Certainly, a good excuse for us is that a book about how the left needs to get better at focusing is a book that explicitly focuses on its audience and says in the opening chapter, here’s who we’re writing this book for. Because if you’re writing a book about what went wrong in America over the last 50 years, there is maybe an infinitude of stories that you could tell, an infinitude of audiences you want to tell those stories to. But I like the fact that we say, This is a book about how we want liberalism to change. And telling liberals to not be conservatives is essentially telling them to not do the thing they’ve already decided they definitely don’t want to do.\n\nSo that’s a way in which I think the focus of this book, even though you’re absolutely right that it says from the start, Look: There are conservatives who are doing their own thing. We wish them well—I think that’s the line explicitly—this is a book about how we want liberalism to change in America, because we have a vision of America that we believe to be in keeping with liberal outcomes and liberal priorities.\n\n[Music]\n\nDemsas: After the break: Is localism standing in the way of abundance?\n\n[Break]\n\nDemsas: So I definitely want to come back to the electoral side of this, but before then, because you both are trapped on my podcast, I’m going to ask you about my work, which has been really focused on decentralization and localism. And this is a thing that I think you know: I loved your book. I think it’s great. I think everyone should buy it. We will put links to everything you are saying at the—\n\nKlein: You gotta say that at the top, Jerusalem. (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: It’ll be in the intro. Don’t worry. (Laughs.)\n\nKlein: You can’t hope people are going to make it all the way here. (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: Yeah. People aren’t going to make it to even minute 30 of this podcast.\n\nSo, you know, I think the thing that’s missing in your book, for me, was a discussion of decentralization and localism, because something I have become pretty strongly convinced of is that even when you have alignment of a lot of these interests towards abundance, towards growth, the thing that becomes difficult is: It’s really, really hard to do anything if you have to get a thousand people on board.\n\nAnd so you get the situation where, you know, someone who I was talking to who works really strongly in transportation told me that he’d had a conversation with a Swedish transportation planner who was shocked to realize that when a project got a right of way, when it got permission to use an area of road from one part of the government, it did not mean that it didn’t have to go to multiple other levels of government to get that. Like, he just could not believe that’s how we did things here.\n\nAnd so to me, I think that this is a core problem of abundance that abundance has to deal with. And I think it’s one of the hardest parts because there’s a way to get people animated about housing. There’s a way to get people animated about energy. I mean, these are core things that people think about in their lives. But trying to get people on board with a vision of how you streamline government, in a very boring way—putting together offices, making sure there are fewer local governments in consolidation—like, this is not a popular thing, and it’s not a thing that people are willing to focus on. So is the fact that it’s left out an indication that you don’t view this as a core part of the goals of abundance? Or what’s going on here?\n\nThompson: Jerusalem, you know the dynamics of localism better than I do, but I’ve done a bit of reporting on opposition to housing and the [Research] Triangle area, in North Carolina. And the layers here are very interesting because you have NIMBY residents who understand the machinery of opposition. So if there’s a new development that’s up for a vote, these folks know where to show up. They know what council meetings to make statements at. They know how to pitch those statements directly to the council.\n\nAnd then in many cases, the council members are, in some cases, antibuild activists who ran for office and pride themselves in standing up against developers. And so it’s not just about changing minds in the public; it’s also about the phenomenon of these meetings. And it’s about the people who sit on the councils.\n\nAnd I’ve asked people down here in government, What would change this? What would change this dynamic and make it easier to build housing? And some of it they said is just, You need new people in the city council who are going to vote for housing rather than associate good governance with the ability to always discover reasons to oppose new developments, right? Some of it is just a matter of personnel in the city council.\n\nSome of it, they said, is a matter of retail politics and persuasion. It’s a matter of making the case when you’re talking to folks that you’re the mayor or you’re the city council because your priority is to expand housing development no matter what. And you’re going to repeat that priority at every city council meeting over and over and over, and it’s going to be your north star. And you’re not going to allow other process-oriented priorities to eclipse it.\n\nBut sometimes it’s just a matter of political courage. It’s a mayor or a city council member standing up in one of these city council meetings where the audience is, you know, 80–20 against new development and pointing out a fact that I believe you, Jerusalem, have told me many times, which is that: For every one person in this room who has the time and energy and resources to appear here, there are 10 people not in this room who will be helped by housing abundance. And so what we are seeing, what we are seeing in this room in the city council meeting, is a meeting that is oriented around caring for the people who get up in front of the microphone. But being in government means caring about the people who don’t have time to come here and step up to the mic.\n\nAnd I think that kind of political courage is akin to—not equivalent to, but akin to—what we saw in Pennsylvania with [Governor Josh] Shapiro and [PennDOT Secretary Mike] Carroll essentially saying, Look—we’ve got a bridge that fell down in I-95, and we can go through the regular processes, and it can take—What?—12, 24 months to rebuild this bridge. We can have, you know, procurement rules, and we can have bidding rules, and we can have environmental review that goes on and on, and we can have permitting. But fundamentally, we need to put this thing up in two weeks. And so that’s what they did. They put it up in two weeks. They said, No environmental reviews. We’re going to get this contractor over here, and this contractor over here to build the damn thing as soon as possible. And they built the damn thing as soon as possible. It took 12 days and not 12 months.\n\nSo I do think that a lot of this comes down to political courage, and it’s going to take political courage to do what you are talking about, to take a culture of federalized localism and say, You know what? I think we might be better off if we limit the number of opportunities that people who oppose development in this city have to block every single thing that happens. And I’m just going to go on the road and say over and over again: I’m not doing this to limit citizen voice. In a way, I’m doing it to raise citizen voice, because I care more about the voices of the people who are not complaining on the mic every two months. I care about those voices more than I care about the people who happen to have time to go up in front of the microphone.\n\nThat’s a hard thing to say, and I cannot guarantee that it’s politically popular enough to win election after election. But I do think that fundamentally what you’re asking for is not just a procedural, not just a sort of a governance, organizational change. It’s a matter of personality. It’s a matter of courage as well.\n\nKlein: I think that’s right. I really want to pick up on that idea that it’s a matter of personality. One of the core theses of the book—I’m not sure how explicitly we say it outside of the Mancur Olson section—is that modern liberalism is overly process focused, that it has repeatedly substituted process for outcome. And that takes different shapes in different places.\n\nSo when you’re dealing with things that require local approval, like housing, you often have that as the problem of decentralization, right? The power is split, fractured—these meetings that have very, very unrepresentative samples of the population showing up. But when you’re dealing with other areas, right? Like, I spent a bunch of time on the CHIPS and Science Act in the book, and the Notice of Funding Opportunity and all of the everything-bagel provisions and added standards and goals that got put into there.\n\nAnd that wasn’t localism. That wasn’t even decentralization. That was done centrally at the Commerce Department. And I report on that, and I know a bunch of the people involved. That was just coming out of a culture in liberalism, of personalities, as Derek put it a second ago, that just kind of doesn’t want to say no to anybody, that wants everybody in the coalition to be as happy as possible.\n\nSo I think that the view that I at least came to, ultimately—I don’t want to speak for Derek here—is that this is all manifestations of something similar that we don’t have, like, a really good way to talk about. But it’s closer to the temperament of a coalition. If the temperament of the MAGA coalition right now is autocratic, the temperament of the liberal coalition is bureaucratic. And in becoming bureaucratic, it shapes itself differently at different levels of government. But sort of at all of them, somebody needs to be in the meeting who can say, Enough. Thank you, everybody, for your opinions. We are going to do this. Sometimes that is a question of power. Sometimes that is a question of leadership. Sometimes you don’t have the ability to do that, and we need to restructure the way, in theory, at least, that the overlapping, jurisdictional issues are handled.\n\nThat’s very, very hard to do, and I think you should be very pessimistic about good outcomes if that’s your only approach that will work. And sometimes it’s that somebody needs to just say it and, like, be willing to take the political pain for saying it. I sort of think this is somehow connected to educational polarization in the parties—this is not in the book, because I can’t prove it—\n\nDemsas: (Laughs.) That’s what podcasts are for.\n\nKlein: Right? I think this is connected in a way that educational polarization in the parties, in the way that the Democratic Party has aligned to become the prosystem party, and the Republican Party is aligned more to become the antisystem party. And you just have a relationship to systems and processes and bureaucracies that are different on the two sides.\n\nAnd there are huge pathologies in the Republican approach to this. It is not good that nobody can tell Donald Trump no. It is not good that they don’t listen to anybody else, that they don’t give a shit what any of the Republicans in Congress think. It is not good that if you tell Elon Musk he’s believing conspiracy theories, he will tell you to fuck off, and fire you from his company or throw you out of the meeting, right?\n\nI actually have this whole view—and, again, not in the book, but we’re in Podcast Land here—that the temperaments of the two coalitions have polarized into very unhealthy personality types. Basically, the coalitions need an ecosystem of different personalities in them: some who are more authoritarian, like, a little bit, right? Some who are much more process oriented. It was good for the Democratic coalition that it had its antisystem hippies inside of it. Now that, you know, as Matt Yglesias puts it, the crank realignment has put RFK Jr. and all those people in the Republican Party, they’re too crankish. And, in a way, the Democratic Party is insufficiently skeptical of big corporations and big systems.\n\nSo there’s something here that I think is really important. It’s very hard to prove, but I do think it’s temperamental. And it sometimes comes out, as you were saying, in too much localism, but not only in that. If it were only in that, then we would just have a big chapter on how localism is a problem. But because we see it rhyming across so many places often where localism has nothing to do with it, I think it’s something broader.\n\nDemsas: One of the things that I love about your book is how much you focus on abundance as, like, a vibe shift and not just a laundry list of policy changes, but that there needs to be a serious reorientation in how people think about themselves, their roles, what liberalism is for. I mean, you analogize it to how environmentalism was this lens that gave everyone a different way of viewing government and industry and the goals of liberalism. And, you know, abundance is hopefully another lens that people can use and apply.\n\nBut both of you have brought up Trump and Musk a bunch of times in this conversation, and I imagine someone coming to this conversation fresh—coming to your book fresh, and hasn’t been deeply involved in the debates that we all have been for the past several years in the abundance space—might be confused as to why this book is coming out now, hitting liberals for undermining government. And, of course, publishing timelines are what they are.\n\nBut Ben Wallace-Wells wrote a review of your book, and books of friends of the show Yoni Appelbaum and Marc Dunkelman, for The New Yorker. And he made the following comment that I hope you guys can respond to: “The abundance advocates emphasize the problem of ideology, because of who usually wrote the rules, but what’s happening is also, more simply, about wealth and power. When it comes to the expense of New York’s subways, the latest studies identify some specific culprits: the city builds many more mezzanine levels in its stations than is the case in stations overseas, and it hires more consultants. How much of that is really about liberalism?”\n\nHe goes on to say that it is “flatly ahistorical” to blame liberals for lack of progress on climate change. So I guess the question that has been posed to me multiple times as well is: Are we all just engaged in a long line of liberal self-flagellation and are ignoring the elephant in the room that is the Republican and Trump-Musk administration? Or is Ben wrong?\n\nKlein: I think Ben is wrong. (Laughs.)\n\nLook: I wrote a whole book about how much you can’t get done at the national level because of Republicans. So I sort of take a back seat to nobody on that, and that’s a huge amount of my coverage. But does Ben think California is well governed? Does Ben think New York is well governed? Does Ben think Illinois is well governed? Does Ben think these places where Republicans hold zero power are losing people by coincidence?\n\nAt some point, you have to be able to say, It’s not the only thing happening in the world that the other side is bad. Now, it’s awkward to bring out this book—I mean, in some ways, it’s helpful; in some ways, it’s awkward—to bring it, you know, during the Elon Musk–Donald Trump–DOGE era. Although, I do think that it gives us a kind of way to talk about: If you don’t make government work—really make it work—if you do not actually truly care that people can feel it in their lives, that you don’t have these debacles, like $42 billion for broadband that doesn’t give anybody broadband access, then you’re going to open the door for right-wing populists to come in and burn it down.\n\nBut I think that there is—sometimes I’m reading reviews. I’m actually pretty comfortable with bad reviews. I’ve been in this game for a very long time. And—\n\nDemsas: I don’t think it’s even a bad review.\n\nKlein: Ben’s wasn’t a bad review. That’s not what I’m saying. Ben’s was actually a very good piece.\n\nBut the thing I was going to say is that sometimes in reviews, you can tell when you have tripped people’s preference for affect, right? They just, like, want more Republican bashing in the thing, right? They want what Tyler Cowen would call more “mood affiliation.” And I just think we actually need less of it. And I think one way you develop credibility as a political tendency is you admit where you’ve gone wrong.\n\nYes, it is the case that it is substantially due to Republican opposition at the national level that we have not been able to pass more on climate. On the other hand, it is not the case that Republican opposition is why, after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, Democrats never did permitting reform to make sure that the money it is spending could build enough of the green infrastructure it intends to build at the speed that we need to build it.\n\nRepublicans actually were willing to work with Democrats on that. It was Democrats who did not want to go forward there. Now, the Biden administration sort of hid behind Joe Manchin and supported Joe Manchin’s permitting bills, but liberals hated Manchin. And by the way, Joe Manchin’s permitting reform is not what I would’ve done.\n\nSo I think you just gotta be really careful. There are, I think, very good critiques of this. But why, you know, we have to spend more time blaming Republicans for our own failures I actually just don’t think is one of them, and I think it’s a kind of intellectual-failure mode in politics.\n\nI think we’ve got to spend a lot of time blaming Republicans for Republican failures, and they’re currently attempting an autocratic breakthrough at the top of the U.S. government. And, like, obviously, I cover that day in and day out, but I think liberals don’t take their own failures nearly seriously enough. And the real problem with that, in addition to that then we can’t fix them, is also: Voters notice. And voters don’t trust you.\n\nGavin Newsom wants to run for president with the burning desire of a thousand suns. Right? He wants it so bad. And Gavin Newsom has every right to run for president. The guy’s governor of California. He’s going to have a huge problem running for president, because people don’t think California’s well governed. And it’s not even that he hasn’t been trying to change a bunch of that. I think a lot of what Gavin Newsom has been trying to do is good, but the fact of the matter is: Housing is a disaster. Homelessness is a disaster. They haven’t built high-speed rail. And none of it has been solved.\n\nSo that’s another issue. You begin destroying total generations, really, of political talent because they’re coming out of a place where they can’t defend what they’ve done. Like, does anybody want Kathy Hochul to run for president? When people don’t think the places you run are working, it doesn’t then work to say, Trust us.\n\nAnd so I just don’t think you can—like, it is true that part of why various decarbonization actions have not worked is due to Republican opposition and obstruction. And again, that’s all mentioned in the book. But it’s just also true that we haven’t done a good enough job. And that’s part of the reason Texas and Georgia and a bunch of red places are building more out of the IRA than liberal states. The places where liberal states are getting more IRA money is in the credits to buy things that are built elsewhere.\n\nThompson: Yeah. To the extent that Ezra and I disagree about anything, certainly no disagreements have been revealed in the last 55 minutes. Because I want to echo and amen with hands over my head everything that he just said, and also, ladle some extra defensiveness on top of it.\n\nYou know, to the extent that Ben thinks it is flatly historical that liberals are the principal enemies of climate change, I just want to be very clear: All four of us—me, Ezra, Jerusalem, Ben—all know that this is in the book and that we all agree about this. I mean, we say in the first chapter that it’s no point talking to Republicans about climate-change goals if so many Republicans don’t even believe in or prioritize climate change.\n\nAnd then as we talk about in the penultimate chapter, the U.S.—I don’t think this is well understood—in the 1970s was, in many ways, the world leader on solar energy. And we basically gutted our energy R&D and our solar industry because Ronald Reagan comes into office and puts a dentist in as the head of the Department of Energy and takes the solar panels off the roof of the White House. And basically, we decide for the next 30 years that we’re not going to do anything about the development of solar energy.\n\nSo that is in the book, and it is absolutely the case that if both parties agreed with the fervor of the Democrats that climate change was a problem, we’d be in a very different state in terms of the amount of zero-carbon energy that we produce in this country. That’s No. 1.\n\nNo. 2: I think the most important part of Ezra’s message right there is that liberalism should be an advertisement for liberalism. And if it isn’t, then we’ll lose. One of the best lines in the book, and this was Ezra’s addition, is that Democrats should be able to say, Vote for us, and we’ll make America like California. And instead, Republicans can say, Vote for Democrats, and they’ll turn America into California. They’ll turn America into Portland; they’ll turn America into Oregon.\n\nWe don’t want to give them this ammunition, because it’s incredibly effective to say that the places that liberals run are, unfortunately, not run well. And finally, on the issue of, say, the Second Avenue subway, you know, I was talking to Sam Bowman for an article in The Atlantic about the degree to which the U.K. could use an abundance agenda. And he made a really interesting point, because if there’s any country that has a worse problem of building than America, it’s clearly the U.K., which has basically been on a downward slope since, you know, something like the Victorian era when it came to building things in that country.\n\nAnd I said, you know, Why does Spain and Portugal—why do these countries, which don’t rival Britain in terms of wealth—seem to do so much better on building things? And he said, In Spain in particular, you’ve had coalitions in government that run on their ability to build quickly and effectively. And I was like, Jesus Christ. What a concept. I mean, imagine a mayor of New York running on New York accelerating the degree to which it’s building the Second Avenue subway at a cost that isn’t $2 billion per square mile. Imagine someone being able to run for governor of New York for, say, another term by saying, Look at our progress in high-speed rail, and look at our progress with homelessness.\n\nThis idea of people running for government by pointing to their achievements at making government work, that’s unbelievable to me. And that’s what we should aim for. We should aim for liberals being able to run by saying, Look at how I made liberalism work where liberalism had power. And right now, I don’t think that there are enough places that can do that. And as a result, I think it’s hard for liberalism to build power without those advertisements.\n\nDemsas: You guys are making a couple of electoral arguments, both in the book and implicitly in what you’ve been saying here. One is that, you know, the specific messaging-argument problem, which is just, like, If you can’t point to the thing that you’ve done and say it’s good, then why would people vote for you? But then you also are kind of drawing out some math problems for Democrats when it comes to population loss in blue states making it harder for Democrats to win the electoral college, reducing congressional representation in the House.\n\nBut I think the thing that struck me as the most important are the arguments you make about how scarcity fuels illiberalism. Can you draw out those arguments for me?\n\nKlein: I love it. Well, we do quote you in those arguments. Do you want to draw those arguments? (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: That’s why they’re so good. (Laughs.)\n\nThompson: What’s your favorite passage of a Jerusalem Demsas article? And just read it slowly and mellifluously.\n\nDemsas: Sure. Let’s do that.\n\nKlein: Yeah, there’s a lot of Jerusalem Demsas in the book. I think you had the best piece on this, so I’m going to do the weird podcaster thing and be like, How do you think scarcity draws out of liberalism?\n\nDemsas: Well, first of all, you guys are very generous citers. Anyone who is interested in reading more, it’s very easy. There’s, like, a hundred pages of notes and acknowledgements in here. But I think on this question of illiberalism, this is something that got into my head, particularly, when it came to Trump and Vance’s campaigning against immigration. And of course, I’m not making the claim that there are no legitimate concerns about immigration. We’ll park that for a second.\n\nWhat we saw was clearly a weaponization of scarcity, and the problem of scarcity incites one of two possible responses, right? Either it’s: There’s not enough. I have to defend my own. I have to, you know, eventually make sure that other people can’t take housing that could go to my child, or this really good job might go to an immigrant or to a person of color, or to a woman and not to me or my family member or friend. And that’s, like, one very natural response to scarcity.\n\nAnd the other is liberalism. It’s the promise that you can make more, that there can be enough housing for everyone who needs it, that there can be, you know, enough good-quality jobs that new people coming into your community isn’t a threat to your way of life. It’s actually making your life better. But the problem is that that has to actually be true, right? And as you talk about in these blue states, I mean, there is a problem where they have made housing scarce That has created a serious problem. And, I mean, we saw that in Springfield, Ohio, as a very effective cudgel for Trump and Vance to wield.\n\nAnd so to me, abundance is a necessary prerequisite for liberalism at large. If you want people to feel open to expanding rights to people who are different from them, to be open to new things happening, to change immigration, whatever it is, they have to feel like there’s an abundance of opportunity. You’re never going to look at a choice between an immigrant and your child in the housing market and decide to go with the immigrant, you know what I mean?\n\nSo the thing I want to get from you two is, like: I worry that many people are taking a policy critique, something about the goals that we might have with decarbonization, with abundant housing, with a bunch of other things and trying to make it into an electoral argument. Because right now, in particular, the Democratic Party is searching for a way towards relevancy, and there’s room to make an argument to that set of policy makers.\n\nSo do you think that we are—and I mean me, in particular, that I’m—overstating the importance of abundance from an electoral standpoint? Like, how much of it is important, given that we’re in this populist moment, you know, that’s very anticentralization, very opposed to government, lots of people excited by the so-called DOGE efficiency move? So how much of this is just wish casting that we’re doing? And is it really relevant to Democrats’ electoral outcomes that they’re focused on abundance?\n\nKlein: Well, let me say a few things. One is that we’re definitely not in a moment that is anticentralization, because we’ve never seen a presidency working as hard to centralize power. Not never, but in the modern era, we haven’t seen a presidency working as hard to centralize power and actively centralizing power as Donald Trump. And certainly his, you know, quote-unquote populist right is loving that, which, to be fair, is how the populous right usually is. It’s a highly centralized, you know, The people will have their voice through the leader who authentically represents the will of the people and wields power without check, balance, or oversight.\n\nSo it’s always kind of a contradictory mess. But that’s, I think, the moment we’re in. And I do think it does exist a little bit as a response to highly bureaucratized liberalism, although that’s not the only thing, obviously, it’s responding to.\n\nOne of the things I was thinking about when you were saying that, Jerusalem, was Elon Musk and the way in which, I mean, it’s like we’re in Dark Elon Musk territory, very much so. Because you can imagine this other Elon Musk, right? Elon Musk as a political figure, you know, from 2012, 2014 who is proabundance, because Elon Musk’s career is, like, an amazing set of proof points for at least part of what, you know, Derek and I want to see in the world.\n\nHere you have an immigrant who came to America. He then set up, first, a series of businesses in the lightly regulated digital sector. But then he began moving into the highly regulated automobile and go-to-space sectors, and solar, for that matter. And then he built these companies on the back of government subsidies, government loan guarantees, and government contracts, becoming the single-best example—living example—for what public-private partnerships can accomplish.\n\nLike, you can really imagine Elon Musk as this unbelievable messenger of abundance and trying to make possible more of the kind of thing he did for more companies, more people. Instead, he’s trying to pull up the ladders behind him and get more contracts and, you know. And I think a lot of what he’s doing is ideologically motivated as he’s fallen down darker and darker right-wing rabbit holes on the platform he bought to derange himself.\n\nBut there’s something else there that could have happened. And it points to—and this is the thing I say that I do think is an addition to some of the stuff you’ve written in that New York Times essay—where the core of the populous right’s politics has to be scarcity. It just has to be. Because its first commitment is fewer immigrants. Its first commitment is that trade is a zero-sum game where there’s always a winner or a loser. Abundance is fundamentally positive sum, and the populist right is fundamentally negative sum, or at least zero-sum. There is nothing more fundamental to the way Donald Trump views the world than the things that are zero-sum negotiations. All of them. There’s always a winner and loser.\n\nAnd it’s just not how we see it. So he has to choose the pathway he’s choosing, because that is the dark engine of his politics, both here and in other countries. He didn’t invent this. This is something we’ve seen in many places, at many times. So electorally, then, I think you get into a couple questions. And look—there are a lot of electoral pathways that might work. And I don’t run in elections and win a lot of elections, but I’ve covered politics for a long time.\n\nOne thing that I do believe is just true is that you tend to win when you represent the future and not the past. And I think a really dangerous thing electorally for Democrats is that Donald Trump’s meaning has fundamentally changed since 2016. In 2016, he represented a kind of past against Hillary Clinton representing a different kind of past. And now he represents a future because Musk and RFK Jr. and Vance and Marc Andreessen—all of them together, the sort of flooding in of Rogan World—it has changed the meaning of Donald Trump from a defense of what there was to an idea about what’s coming.\n\nAnd I think they’re going to fuck that up, because they’re breaking things they don’t understand. You know, and if we don’t fall into autocracy, I think the backlash to the tariffs and everything else is going to be really profound. I could be wrong, obviously. But I think it is fundamental that Democrats are going to need to, if they’re going to be a successful political party, recapture a vision of the future.\n\nI mean, it’s a reason why in our book we put invention so at the core of things, right? We start with that slightly sci-fi vignette because we are trying to get people to imagine a future. This is about what world you are trying to build. And I think that is potent in American politics. I think that in politics, you need to have—to be as successful as you often want to be—a new vision.\n\nI think that you need to reorient politics around a divide that is healthier for you. Polarization is—the next question should always be, Well, what are we polarized over? Right? And is the nature of that cleavage good for us or bad for us? And I think one of the real cleavages right now is abundance and scarcity. And I think people have, like, underplayed this. They’ve wanted to say it’s sort of a moral regressiveness or an anti-institutionalism, right? Like, those are the things Donald Trump represents to liberals. He’s like a racist who hates the fundamental institutions of modern life. And that’s true in many ways. But it’s clearly not enough.\n\nAnd I think as Democrats begin to lose the future and lose the sense that they have a vision of what should be coming, that has become a really profound weakness. So what I’m looking for is, like, not just candidates who can sort of manage the politics-of-evasion problem and accept where Democrats get out of step with people, but candidates who can see some other way of organizing American politics, some other set of conflicts that are better for them and more constructive for the country than what we’ve had. And I think that, like, at a vibes level is what we are trying to offer. Like, a different way of cutting what this is all really about.\n\nThompson: Yeah. One way we sometimes talked about it is that American politics tends to be built on axes: Are you liberal or are you conservative? Are you proimmigrant or are you anti? Are you pro-DEI or are you anti? And we’re trying to introduce a new binary, a new axis here, which is abundance versus scarcity. And the reason why we’re trying to introduce this axis is not just because we think that axis is important, and it’s not just because we think that axis is illuminating to understand American policy and American economics. It’s also an axis on which liberals can win.\n\nWe’ve seen, I think, in the last few months that scarcity doesn’t just empower illiberal movements, as Jerusalem, that was the basis of your question. It’s also the case that scarcity empowers illiberal movements to pursue scarcity. I mean, look at what the Trump administration has done in the first few weeks. By saying, America can’t afford our debt—scarcity—we therefore cannot afford healthcare for the poor. More scarcity. Because America doesn’t have a healthy economy—scarcity—we have to accept American hardship—more deprivation. Because we don’t have enough manufacturing, we have to suffer the consequences of tariffs—scarcity for scarcity. Because we don’t have enough housing, we therefore need fewer immigrants. Oh, we don’t have enough of this, therefore we need less of that which we need. I mean, this is an argument of scarcity requiring scarcity, and it is an argument that we should be, as liberals, excited to take on, right?\n\nEvery administration invariably creates the conditions for its own opposition. Every single administration does this. That is the basis of thermostatic politics in America, and it’s the basis of thermostatic politics around the world. I think that liberals need both a negative identity and a positive identity. And this is my gloss, my wrapping paper on what Ezra just said: You need a negative identity, which is what you’re against, and you need a positive identity, which is what you’re for.\n\nIt’s obvious what the Democratic Party is against. Open any newspaper any day of the week: That’s what we’re against, right? Donald Trump is taking a wrecking ball to politics. Elon Musk is tweeting nonsense after nonsense on social media, while, at the same time, pretending he understands things that he’s absolutely demolishing. That, I think, goes catastrophically against American interests. The negative identity of the Democratic Party is incredibly clear. That is the unfortunate toxic gift of Donald Trump in power.\n\nBut what’s the positive identity? What are we actually for, beyond just being against Donald Trump? That’s where I think we need to offer a positive-sum vision, right? And that vision is what we call abundance. And it’s why, again, I think it’s really cool to have a book that is predominantly, in so many ways, a self-critique of the body of liberalism in America. But it begins with a sci-fi positive vision. Here’s what we’re aiming for. Here is our north star. This is what we want to build. Let’s see if we can get out of our way and build it.\n\nAnd of course, that requires winning elections against a movement that right now is dominated by Donald Trump. But I don’t think we need further clarification on how to be anti-Trump. I think we need further clarification on how to stand for something bigger than being anti-Trump.\n\nDemsas: So one thing I wanted to ask about—and I mean this: A big part of your book is about invention and about scientific innovation. We haven’t talked a lot about that. But one thing I think I wanted to ask about it is that it feels, in many ways, that the barriers hampering housing, transit, energy are different than the ones standing in the way of scientific innovation.\n\nI mean, in housing, we know how to build a house. Transit: We see high-speed rail. We see energy. We know how to build solar panels. These are things that other countries are building. Of course, there’s innovation that can happen in all of these spaces, and I appreciate all of the focus on productivity that you have in the book. But are the problems preventing scientific innovation—are those really in the same wheelhouse as these other baskets that you guys are focusing on?\n\nThompson: Some of them absolutely are, and some of them absolutely are not. You know, in one way, you can think about abundance as being a kind of three-part process. Part one is: You decide what the good is that you’re aiming for. What’s the positive vision?\n\nPart two is: You have to actually understand the market, the industry that is responsible for producing that vision. You have to understand local housing markets to figure out what’s wrong with housing. You have to understand clean-energy technology and siting rules in order to figure out how to build more clean energy. And in science and technology, you have to understand science markets and how scientific funding works and how the discovery process works.\n\nAnd then part three is: You remove the bottlenecks that are in the way. And sometimes that means taking things away, and sometimes it means adding things. So in the world of science, right, what we want are more lifesaving medical breakthroughs that add the most important thing in the world, which is more healthy years of life. And the difficult thing about science is that you don’t exactly know what you are aiming for specifically, because unlike building a house or unlike siting a solar farm, discoveries are, by their very nature, unknown before you discover them.\n\nSo what I did for this piece is try to figure out, Okay, what are the inputs to scientific breakthroughs? It’s smart people, it’s time, and it’s money. The problem that we identified with the National Institutes of Health is that we have created, over the last 60 years, a set of bureaucratic procedures and paperwork requirements. This created a situation where the typical scientist now spends his or her time filling out paperwork or filing grants and not doing actual science.\n\nI consider that to be an absolute catastrophe, and so do many scientists. And you can reframe the catastrophe this way: Imagine if we discovered one day in the near future that typical American scientists suffered from a virus that created a chronic-fatigue disorder that knocked out 40 percent of their working years, such that they had to sleep, say, between January and late May of every single year. We’d say, Well, obviously, this is an enormous crisis for American science. But in many cases, this is not an exogenous bacteria or virus. These are requirements in paperwork laws that we have created for ourselves and for our scientists.\n\nSo first, I want to find ways of experimenting with funding that reduces the paperwork requirements in ways that I see very similar as the benefits of reducing bureaucratic and paperwork requirements in, say, affordable-housing construction or broadband-internet construction with the Infrastructure Act under President Biden.\n\nSo there are some things that I think we want to take away and reform and streamline in ways that are totally similar to many earlier parts of the book. But also, I’m not a pure libertarian on this standpoint. I don’t think that the road to scientific abundance flows purely through just taking things away.\n\nI also think we need to create new programs and recognize, for example, the absolute wonder that Operation Warp Speed did. I mean, Operation Warp Speed truly is one of the most remarkable programs in modern American history because it was fantastically successful at producing a life-saving medical therapy, and also, in a weird way, has been abandoned by both the Democratic and Republican Parties.\n\nDemocrats don’t talk about it, because it’s a Trump initiative, and Republicans, I think, don’t talk about it because, in many cases, they’re an anti-vax movement. And so it’s been orphaned, but the lessons of Operation Warp Speed—the way it created incentives for scientists, the way it removes roadblocks for actually building therapies that you invent—I think are incredibly important if we want to create science that saves people’s lives and build that science into products that extends people’s lives.\n\nSo the way I see it, the message in science intervention is absolutely in keeping with the thrust of abundance. It depends on a positive vision. It depends on a very keen understanding of the market that’s relevant to making that vision a reality. And then it looks very clearly at: What are the bottlenecks to take away and what are the policies to add?\n\nDemsas: This talking about innovation and the failures inherent in the scientific process feels like a great time to ask our last and final question. Derek, let’s start with you. What is something that you originally thought was a good idea but ended up being only good on paper?\n\nThompson: When Laura and I had our first kid, we were getting a lot of advice from people about the need to put the baby first and the fact that, of course, when you have a baby, the baby is what suddenly must come first. And that sounded fantastic. It’s certainly something close to the cliché of what new parents are told, that something has been introduced to their life around which they have to reorient their life. And that’s absolutely true in so many ways.\n\nBut the truth is, the best advice that I got about being a parent was the exact opposite. I was talking to a friend, Brian, who said, I think my favorite parenting advice is, No. 1: Look out for yourself. No. 2: Look out for the relationship with your partner. And then No. 3: Look out for your child. If you’re not your best self, he won’t be the best possible partner. And if you’re not the best possible partnership, you won’t be good parents.\n\nSo in a weird way, the child comes last. And there’s something beautifully counterintuitive and lovely about that, about the need for and the benefit of a kind of wise selfishness in parenting. And I love that that goes slightly against the good-on-paper advice of when you have a baby, that new baby needs to be the pure and unassailable sun around which your solar system must orbit.\n\nDemsas: We get a lot of parenting responses in Good on Paper. Ezra, what’s yours?\n\nKlein: Ooh, I mean, I think before Derek gave that answer, I was going to give a very book-related answer about something about regulations or—not all regulations, but, you know, there’s certain categories of regulations and comment structures that I took just as generally good before that I don’t now.\n\nBut I’ll give a more personal one, so I don’t seem like a robot: Getting less sleep. For a lot of my life and definitely a lot of my career, my 20s as a journalist and early 30s maybe, probably particularly before I had kids, I was a very much, like, a sleep-is-a-cousin-of-death kind of person. And I would try to set the alarm earlier and earlier, and would just push through, and sort of felt that every hour I was spending asleep was an hour I wasn’t spending alive.\n\nAnd I really just now understand that to be the opposite. I had this one moment at some point where I thought I had been just kind of anxious for years, and maybe I was just tired. Like, maybe I just mixed up the two feelings, or the two feelings were just feeding into each other, certainly. And so now, I do not always succeed, because I have kids and a job and all the rest of it, but I really would like to get as much sleep as I possibly can as opposed to as little sleep as I can possibly get away with. And that has been a pretty big conceptual change.\n\n[Music]\n\nThompson: I would warn listeners: Don’t take these pieces of advice in the opposite order. Don’t try to sleepmax and then have a baby. That will lead to a little bit of priority confusion. Nonetheless, I do think that when you do have a kid, being protective of sleep is unbelievably important for all of the obvious reasons.\n\nDemsas: Well, thank you both for coming on the show. I’m so excited that this book is in the world. I’m so excited to continue this conversation with the both of you.\n\nKlein: Thank you, and for all your work here, which is hugely informative to what we ended up doing. Really, really appreciate it.\n\nThompson: Yeah. Thanks for being an inspiration.\n\nDemsas: Good on Paper is produced by Rosie Hughes.

        "content": "“This is the time of your life,” the nurse said to me as she searched for a vein. At 27, I finally had health insurance and could get the colonoscopy that doctors had been suggesting for years, so I was feeling pretty good about things—as good as one can feel after having spent the previous 12 hours in the bathroom. But she wasn’t referring to the procedure; she was talking about my age. Even at this very odd, very vulnerable moment, I represented to her freedom and opportunity—your 20s, supposedly the time of your life.\n\nMany people roll their 20s through a sugar coating of nostalgia. But framing young adulthood as the best time of life is a little grim, as it puts a limit on growth. This glorification of youth also seems to assume that everyone has the same resources; moves on the same timeline, in the same way; and has the same kind of life, one filled with adventure and experimentation.\n\nThis decade is supposed to simultaneously be a golden age of rootless freedom and fearless exploration and, somewhat contradictorily, the time when you’re meant to figure out your career, your relationships, and your life goals. That’s a lot of pressure.\n\nOver the past few years, I’ve spoken with dozens of 20-somethings from all different backgrounds and in all sorts of circumstances to learn how they understand this time in their life. The young adults I talked with didn’t articulate far-flung fantasies of a #bestlife as Instagram illustrates it. They described a desire to simply feel like enough. They wanted more nuanced conversations about what making your way in the world as a young adult actually means.\n\nFifty years ago, the sociological markers of adulthood included finishing high school, entering the workforce, moving away from home, getting married, and having children. Now, according to a 2017 study, Americans consider the most important adult milestones to be graduating from college or another postsecondary program and achieving financial stability, both sometimes impossible feats. As the researchers Alexis Redding and Nancy E. Hill recently noted in The Atlantic, the ability of young adults to enter adulthood has always been tied closely to how well the economy is doing.\n\nRead: The real reason young adults seem slow to ‘grow up’\n\nAnd the economy is not in our favor. Though we’re the largest part of the workforce, young Millennials own less than 5 percent of the wealth in the United States. When Baby Boomers were in their 20s, they controlled about 21 percent. According to the Economic Policy Institute, from 1979 to 2019, productivity rose 72 percent in the U.S. while hourly pay increased only roughly 17 percent. During the pandemic, young people have been unemployed at more than double the national average, and rates of uninsured young adults have risen, according to data from the Center for Law and Social Policy.\n\nWe all might be grappling with the chaos of finding ourselves and all that comes with it—dating, changing family dynamics, work stress—but the stakes are not the same for everyone. “Defining adulthood for oneself has in many ways become one of the pressures of this developmental period,” Dalal Katsiaficas, an educational-psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told me. “Those with the most power and privilege in our society tend to narrate endless options of what adulthood can look like.” Meanwhile, many of those who are more marginalized describe what she calls “foreclosed” opportunities—some feel locked out of ever achieving adult status, while some take on adult roles much earlier than others.\n\nI’ve been running on a treadmill with little sense of direction, just forward, forward, forward, misguidedly believing that when I “figured it out,” whatever it was, I would finally feel released from the sensation that I was the only one who was lost. I felt disappointed in myself when I dropped out of college, when I lost jobs, when I Googled what a 401(k) was. My missteps felt like personal failures instead of a normal part of life—that is, until I started having honest conversations with other people in their 20s.\n\nThe narrative of the wild-and-free 20-something is far from reality for many. \"Someone who is white in their 20s already sort of has more privilege than someone who is of color, so they have more social mobility and more opportunity to accumulate generational wealth,\" Zaria Howell, 21, told me.\n\nHowell is about to graduate from college, and finding the perfect job isn’t necessarily their top priority. They’re thinking holistically about community, joy, and fulfillment. They are also looking beyond their 20s. “I think it’s harmful to, say, you know, forget about this whole lifetime that you have to accomplish your goals, to meet new people, to travel to new places, to learn new things.”\n\nRobert Zambrano, 25, told me that he failed out of college because of personal issues, and was subsequently forced out of his family home. For three years, he was in an electrical union, training to be an electrician, but he found breaking into the old boys’ club difficult. “Every moment we examine the broader mainstream portrayal of twenty-somethings, it just continually fails to match any reality that we live in,” he wrote me by email.\n\nThat includes the trope that all of young adulthood is blissful Instagramming and soul-searching, as if 20-somethings aren’t also caretakers, breadwinners, and parents. LaTesha Harris, 23, began working as a young teenager, helping her mom with rent and utility bills. “Adulting has been very much tied to financial burden,” Harris told me. The majority of people she knows, she said, have no money, no respect from anyone older, no autonomy in the workplace. “It’s like there are a lot of things to realize about yourself and also the world in this time period,” Harris said. “Because that’s such an overwhelming task, I can't see how anyone would consider this the best time in your life.”\n\nRead: When are you really an adult?\n\nShowlin Salam, 26, did everything young people are encouraged to do: She pursued an education as a first-generation student while working full-time, graduated, and got married. Up until recently, she was a frontline worker doing 12-hour days at a pharmacy, where she dealt with customers who spit and coughed on her. Despite reminders to “take care of your mental health,” she was given no resources to do so, and is experiencing anxiety and depression. The “You’re young; it’ll work out!” talking point isn’t helping. Young people aren’t searching for glamorous versions of happiness, Salam told me. Instead, she feels like she’s barely hanging on. “I’m looking for being content, and just finding joy,” she said. “That’s what we are looking for, as Millennials and Gen Z, because of this instability that we're living in right now.”\n\nThe one-size-fits-all narrative of your 20s needs to change. Reports on young adults moving in with their parents at record rates spin that as a moral failure, rather than an economic side effect or a choice made for cultural or family reasons. Remarks about young people being lazy ignore how few jobs are available. Quips about students needing to work overlook how many are working—and how many are still experiencing basic-needs insecurity. Moans about 20-somethings not having kids rarely mention the child-care crisis.\n\nAccording to Katsiaficas, we need policies that support affordable education, living wages, student-debt relief, and a sense of safety and belonging in society—quality-of-life issues that, once addressed, would allow people of all ages to imagine futures that are self-directed. “These are basic needs that have been steadily eroded for young adults,” she said.\n\nWe are growing into ourselves across a whole lifetime, not just throughout one decade. Let’s all retire the idea of our 20s as a #bestlife—and just strive for a good one.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Updated at 5:40 p.m. ET on March 21, 2025\n\nEditor’s note: This analysis is part of The Atlantic’s investigation into the Library Genesis data set. You can access the search tool directly here. Find The Atlantic’s search tool for movie and television writing used to train AI here.\n\nWhen employees at Meta started developing their flagship AI model, Llama 3, they faced a simple ethical question. The program would need to be trained on a huge amount of high-quality writing to be competitive with products such as ChatGPT, and acquiring all of that text legally could take time. Should they just pirate it instead?\n\nMeta employees spoke with multiple companies about licensing books and research papers, but they weren’t thrilled with their options. This “seems unreasonably expensive,” wrote one research scientist on an internal company chat, in reference to one potential deal, according to court records. A Llama-team senior manager added that this would also be an “incredibly slow” process: “They take like 4+ weeks to deliver data.” In a message found in another legal filing, a director of engineering noted another downside to this approach: “The problem is that people don’t realize that if we license one single book, we won’t be able to lean into fair use strategy,” a reference to a possible legal defense for using copyrighted books to train AI.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nCourt documents released last night show that the senior manager felt it was “really important for [Meta] to get books ASAP,” as “books are actually more important than web data.” Meta employees turned their attention to Library Genesis, or LibGen, one of the largest of the pirated libraries that circulate online. It currently contains more than 7.5 million books and 81 million research papers. Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from “MZ”—an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—to download and use the data set.\n\nThis act, along with other information outlined and quoted here, recently became a matter of public record when some of Meta’s internal communications were unsealed as part of a copyright-infringement lawsuit brought against the company by Sarah Silverman, Junot Díaz, and other authors of books in LibGen. Also revealed recently, in another lawsuit brought by a similar group of authors, is that OpenAI has used LibGen in the past. (A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation against the company. In a response sent after this story was published, a spokesperson for OpenAI said, “The models powering ChatGPT and our API today were not developed using these datasets. These datasets, created by former employees who are no longer with OpenAI, were last used in 2021.”)\n\nUntil now, most people have had no window into the contents of this library, even though they have likely been exposed to generative-AI products that use it; according to Zuckerberg, the “Meta AI” assistant has been used by hundreds of millions of people (it’s embedded in Meta products such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram). To show the kind of work that has been used by Meta and OpenAI, I accessed a snapshot of LibGen’s metadata—revealing the contents of the library without downloading or distributing the books or research papers themselves—and used it to create an interactive database that you can search here:\n\nThere are some important caveats to keep in mind. Knowing exactly which parts of LibGen that Meta and OpenAI used to train their models, and which parts they might have decided to exclude, is impossible. Also, the database is constantly growing. My snapshot of LibGen was taken in January 2025, more than a year after it was accessed by Meta, according to the lawsuit, so some titles here wouldn’t have been available to download at that point.\n\nLibGen’s metadata are quite disorganized. There are errors throughout. Although I have cleaned up the data in various ways, LibGen is too large and error-strewn to easily fix everything. Nevertheless, the database offers a sense of the sheer scale of pirated material available to models trained on LibGen. Cujo, The Gulag Archipelago, multiple works by Joan Didion translated into several languages, an academic paper named “Surviving a Cyberapocalypse”—it’s all in here, along with millions of other works that AI companies could feed into their models.\n\nMeta and OpenAI have both argued in court that it’s “fair use” to train their generative-AI models on copyrighted work without a license, because LLMs “transform” the original material into new work. The defense raises thorny questions and is likely a long way from resolution. But the use of LibGen raises another issue. Bulk downloading is often done with BitTorrent, the file-sharing protocol popular with pirates for its anonymity, and downloading with BitTorrent typically involves uploading to other users simultaneously. Internal communications show employees saying that Meta did indeed torrent LibGen, which means that Meta could have not only accessed pirated material but also distributed it to others—well established as illegal under copyright law, regardless of what the courts determine about the use of copyrighted material to train generative AI. (Meta has claimed that it “took precautions not to ‘seed’ any downloaded files” and that there are “no facts to show” that it distributed the books to others.) OpenAI’s download method is not yet known.\n\nMeta employees acknowledged in their internal communications that training Llama on LibGen presented a “medium-high legal risk,” and discussed a variety of “mitigations” to mask their activity. One employee recommended that developers “remove data clearly marked as pirated/stolen” and “do not externally cite the use of any training data including LibGen.” Another discussed removing any line containing ISBN, Copyright, ©, All rights reserved. A Llama-team senior manager suggested fine-tuning Llama to “refuse to answer queries like: ‘reproduce the first three pages of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.”’” One employee remarked that “torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn’t feel right.”\n\nIt is easy to see why LibGen appeals to generative-AI companies, whose products require huge quantities of text. LibGen is enormous, many times larger than Books3, another pirated book collection whose contents I revealed in 2023. Other works in LibGen include recent literature and nonfiction by prominent authors such as Sally Rooney, Percival Everett, Hua Hsu, Jonathan Haidt, and Rachel Khong, and articles from top academic journals such as Nature, Science, and The Lancet. It includes many millions of articles from top academic-journal publishers such as Elsevier and Sage Publications.\n\nRead: These 183,000 books are fueling the biggest fight in publishing and tech\n\nLibGen was created around 2008 by scientists in Russia. As one LibGen administrator has written, the collection exists to serve people in “Africa, India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, China, Russia and post-USSR etc., and on a separate note, people who do not belong to academia.” Over the years, the collection has ballooned as contributors piled in more and more pirated work. Initially, most of LibGen was in Russian, but English-language work quickly came to dominate the collection. LibGen has grown so quickly and avoided being shut down by authorities thanks in part to its method of dissemination. Whereas some other libraries are hosted in a single location and require a password to access, LibGen is shared in different versions by different people via peer-to-peer networks.\n\nMany in the academic world have argued that publishers have brought this type of piracy on themselves, by making it unnecessarily difficult and expensive to access research. Sci-Hub, a sibling of LibGen, was launched independently in 2011 by a Kazakhstani neuroscience student named Alexandra Elbakyan, whose university didn’t provide access to the big academic databases. In that same year, the hacktivist Aaron Swartz was arrested after taking millions of articles from JSTOR in an attempt to build a similar kind of library.\n\nPublishers have tried to stop the spread of pirated material. In 2015, the academic publisher Elsevier filed a complaint against LibGen, Sci-Hub, other sites, and Elbakyan personally. The court granted an injunction, directed the sites to shut down, and ordered Sci-Hub to pay Elsevier $15 million in damages. Yet the sites remained up, and the fines went unpaid. A similar story played out in 2023, when a group of educational and professional publishers, including Macmillan Learning and McGraw Hill, sued LibGen. This time the court ordered LibGen to pay $30 million in damages, in what TorrentFreak called “one of the broadest anti-piracy injunctions we’ve seen from a U.S. court.” But that fine also went unpaid, and so far authorities have been largely unable to constrain the spread of these libraries online. Seventeen years after its creation, LibGen continues to grow.\n\nRead: There’s no longer any doubt that Hollywood writing is powering AI\n\nAll of this certainly makes knowledge and literature more accessible, but it relies entirely on the people who create that knowledge and literature in the first place—that labor that takes time, expertise, and often money. Worse, generative-AI chatbots are presented as oracles that have “learned” from their training data and often don’t cite sources (or cite imaginary sources). This decontextualizes knowledge, prevents humans from collaborating, and makes it harder for writers and researchers to build a reputation and engage in healthy intellectual debate. Generative-AI companies say that their chatbots will themselves make scientific advancements, but those claims are purely hypothetical.\n\nOne of the biggest questions of the digital age is how to manage the flow of knowledge and creative work in a way that benefits society the most. LibGen and other such pirated libraries make information more accessible, allowing people to read original work without paying for it. Yet generative-AI companies such as Meta have gone a step further: Their goal is to absorb the work into profitable technology products that compete with the originals. Will these be better for society than the human dialogue they are already starting to replace?",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Updated at 3:05 pm E.T. on March 22, 2025\n\nEven as Donald Trump advertises his hard-line approach to border crossers, he is actively soliciting one particular group of immigrants: rich ones. In February, Trump proposed that America start offering a U.S. “gold card” for $5 million. “Green-card privileges, plus” is how the president described it: “It’s going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country,” he said. Trump predicted that the United States could sell a million of these cards, enough to eliminate the national debt. Even Russian oligarchs could be eligible, he said—though (thanks to economic sanctions) “they’re not quite as wealthy as they used to be.”\n\nTrump seemed to relish the scheme’s shock value. But these days, buying a visa or passport is not controversial: About half of the world’s nations already offer visas, permanent residence, or even full citizenship for sums ranging from the low five to low seven figures. The U.S. itself grants up to 10,000 residency permits a year under its EB-5 investor visa program, which Congress has approved until 2027 and costs applicants about $1 million.\n\nBut if Trump expects a flood of takers, he has it backwards: The international rich aren’t trying to come here, so much as Americans are trying to get out. U.S. citizens now represent the majority of clients looking for an exit, through foreign citizenship, permanent residence, or a visa that allows them to live abroad.\n\nI have been writing about the world of millionaire migration for years. The market depends on a cottage industry of advisers, financial planners, and lawyers who help their clients navigate the paperwork and requirements, and I spoke with some of these experts in the weeks following Trump’s announcement. All seemed to think that only a handful of people would take Trump’s bait—mainly because there simply aren’t enough people rich enough to shell out $5 million with no return on their investment.\n\nDominic Volek, an executive at the consulting firm Henley & Partners, told me that his clients typically “look at investing 10 percent of their net worth on citizenship or residence.” To consider the gold card, they’d need “a liquid net worth of $50 million, and there are only around 300,000 people globally who have that kind of money.” Even then, gold cards will succeed only “if America’s relaxed about the source of funds,” another lawyer, Sam Bayat, who works with a lot of clients in the Middle East, told me. Shady Russian oligarchs, in other words, might be the target demographic, rather than an edge case.\n\nThe far bigger story is the reverse phenomenon: Thousands of Americans a year are applying to visa programs abroad, primarily in Europe—Portugal in particular—and the Caribbean, where island nations offer citizenship outright, sometimes upon purchase of property. An American doctor or dentist considering a second home in storm-addled Florida might now buy a $325,000 condo in St. Kitts and Nevis instead and, in the bargain, qualify for the island nation’s citizenship in as little as three months. A nature lover might look to Costa Rica, which grants residence (and a fast track to citizenship) for $150,000. Vanuatu will effectively sell you a passport for $130,000; Dominica’s costs $200,000.\n\nAlana Semuels: Should Congress let wealthy foreigners buy green cards?\n\nHistorically, people have looked to buy a different citizenship because they live under undemocratic political systems, or because their passport makes it difficult to travel. (Afghans, for instance, can go to just six countries without a visa; Spaniards can go to 133.) Eric Major, the CEO of the immigration-advising firm Latitude, began his career helping rich Hong Kongers make exit plans to relocate to Canada or the United Kingdom ahead of the territory’s scheduled handover to China. “The smart capital, the top guys in Hong Kong in the 1990s, were all saying, ‘We gotta hedge,’” Major told me, referring to fears that China would crack down on business and political freedoms. Major went on to work mainly with clients from China, Russia, India, and the Middle East.\n\nToday most of Major’s clients are American. Volek’s firm has more clients from America than from the next four biggest feeder countries (Pakistan, Nigeria, India, and the U.K.) combined. Fifteen years ago, the firm did not see much point in opening a U.S. office. This year, it’s launching its tenth. “I never would have imagined my No. 1 source market would become America,” Major told me. “But now the top brass of America is hedging.”\n\nHedging is the operative word: Few of these Americans are actually moving abroad at the moment. It’s about having options, Volek said: “It’s purely the realization that, ‘I’m wealthy and diversified in terms of assets, bonds, and equities, so why on earth would I have one country of citizenship and residence? It makes no sense.’”\n\nThe great American hedge began during the coronavirus pandemic. Overnight, U.S. citizens—even the entitled ultrarich—found themselves barred from entering other countries. “I’m worth $20, $50 million and I have a private jet and a home in Europe, and you’re telling me I can’t enter?” Volek recalls. That wasn’t something Americans “had contemplated before.”\n\nThe emergency passed, and international travel picked back up. But the sense of uncertainty has persisted—compounded by a spate of uniquely American tragedies: school shootings, high-profile displays of systemic racism, and the storming of the Capitol on January 6. Climate events such as hurricanes and wildfires have shaken homeowners, inflation has spooked investors, and the Trump-Biden-Trump whiplash has made politics feel more unpredictable than ever.\n\nNow, as Elon Musk attacks the federal government’s social and regulatory programs, the U.S. is beginning to take on the contours of a nation without a clear future. “It’s the same push factors as other countries,” Major explained. “People don’t trust the government; they’re worried about the quality of the air; they want to educate their kids.”\n\nIt’s hard to exaggerate how meaningful this shift has been for the mobility industry. I’ve been talking to people like Volek and Major since 2012, and I published the first book on the market for passports in 2015. I would always run into the occasional American looking to expatriate, but they tended to be eccentrics, such as a man known as “Bitcoin Jesus” and subscribers to newsletters such as Nomad Capitalist. These Americans weren’t worried about gun violence and political stability. They were hard-core libertarians who wanted to avoid taxes at all costs. Many would go on to renounce their U.S. citizenship after acquiring their foreign one.\n\nAs the people looking to move have changed, so too has the mobility industry, which has far more options now and is far more accessible and socially acceptable. “The overall trend is toward more legitimacy and people realizing it’s totally normal” to pay to emigrate, Kristin Surak, a sociologist at the London School of Economics and Political Science and the author of The Golden Passport, told me.\n\nJonathan Lemire: Elon Musk is president\n\nAmericans without a ton of money are finding ways to access new passports by re-hyphenating themselves. Many are casting around for long-lost relatives through which they can claim Italian, Irish, Austrian, or German citizenship. Tracking down birth certificates from the old country and persuading embassies to accept them as proof of citizenship used to be logistically complicated; now there are consultants to help with that too. European countries have grown accustomed to American applicants who want to expand their options and lower the cost of college, health care, and child care.\n\nAccording to one estimate, about 40 percent of U.S. citizens might be eligible for European passports through their ancestors. Last year, Ireland received 31,825 passport applications from U.S. citizens, Austria naturalized 1,914 (virtually all as reparations for Nazi-era persecutions), and more than 6,100 Americans applied for British citizenship, with a noticeable uptick beginning in November.\n\n“Americans have gotten very pragmatic,” says Audra DeFalco, who specializes in “citizenship by descent” at Latitude. “They’re retirees, people whose grandma was Polish and they really loved their grandma; some want to study abroad without having student loans.”\n\nMore and more, DeFalco says, the Americans with an exit plan are just people who have the time and resources to make one.\n\nWhen I spoke with Charlie, a businessman from the Midwest who is in the process of obtaining a Portuguese “golden visa,” I was struck by what I saw in the background of his video. He wasn’t Zooming from a sterile condo in a glass tower in some anonymous global capital, or a fancy hotel room on his way someplace else. He was sitting in the cozy-looking living room of the suburban house he’d lived in for years.\n\n“We have four kids and two grandsons, who all live very close, and we spend an inordinate amount of time with our family,” Charlie said. “It’s the central focus of our lives.” (He asked to go by a pseudonym in case speaking publicly would interfere with his visa application.)\n\nCharlie’s done well enough as an entrepreneur to afford a pricey Plan B, but he isn’t a jet-setting oligarch or a paranoid crypto bro. He’s a Kamala Harris voter (“obviously”), he’s Jewish (“we go to synagogue on occasion”), and he loves living in America, where he’s part of a tight-knit community. Still, he’s almost at the end of the year-long process to purchase a Portuguese residence permit, which begins with investing about $540,000 in the country.\n\nWhat pushed him to look outside the United States was his growing fear for his safety. Charlie told me that he feels threatened by both the Nazi-saluting right and the Gaza-protesting left. “I have enough knowledge of history to know and to believe that people who say ‘It could never happen here’ are daydreaming,” he said.\n\n(I asked him why he hadn’t simply taken Israeli citizenship, which is available to all Jews, would cost him next to nothing, and was quite literally created for this purpose. “I don’t know that my wife particularly savored the idea of living there,” he said. “It wasn’t in her mind an ideal place.”)\n\nLately, though, his fears have gone way beyond anti-Semitism “to being scared of where our country is going and whether the forces of good will eventually win out over the bullshit that’s tearing down the government,” he said. He sees an escape hatch as common sense, not traitorous. He told me that he’d “even inspired” a few of his friends to look into it.\n\nKrishnadev Calamur: The EU wants to clamp down on the super rich’s visa of choice\n\nMina Hsiao and Chris Carter are a couple nearing retirement age. They recently returned to San Diego after spending most of the past 16 years in Shanghai, but within months, they had applied for a visa to live in Sarawak, on the Malaysian island of Borneo. The permit lasts 10 years and costs about $33,500 a person. Applicants must also have health insurance and be able to financially support themselves.\n\nThe couple had been looking forward to their homecoming, but it quickly became clear that the U.S. they’d left was not the same country that was waiting for them. Hsiao felt unsafe as an Asian woman, particularly when she went out wearing a mask. Carter’s family was divided along political lines. Even their church felt like a minefield. “We were hopeful until November,” Carter recalled. “But after I saw how many people voted for Trump, after the first term, after January 6—and people of faith in the church embracing Christian nationalism …”\n\n“The Christianity that somehow has morphed in this country is not our expression of faith,” Hsiao interjected. “We thought we were coming back to a psychological home, not just the comfort of language but also ideals—security, opportunity for all. And that wasn’t the case.”\n\nHow long do they envision staying abroad? “At least three years, nine months, and two weeks,” Carter joked. “But things will not go back to pre-Trump,” Hsiao added. “That’s our concern.”\n\nKate, who works at a pharmaceutical company in Boston, is establishing European residence through the same visa program as Charlie (and she asked me to use a pseudonym for the same reason). She moved to the United States from Ukraine in 2000 after her family struggled to adjust to post-Soviet turmoil, and got American citizenship soon after.\n\nShe is in her 50s now, and started thinking about relocating a few years ago, when she had some extra cash after downsizing her home. “I thought maybe Cape Cod would be a good investment,” she said, “but then my cousin, a lawyer in Manhattan, said, ‘Don’t do Cape Cod. Buy something in Europe and get a citizenship.”\n\nThen, in January, she saw a message on social media about federal workers being asked “to stay loyal or resign,” Kate told me. She “completely freaked out” and sent it to her family, commenting: “Perestroika in one week.” She’s now in the process of applying for permanent residence in Portugal.\n\n“I have my job in America, so there’s no rush to move,” Kate said. “But I fear civil war.” She told me she felt lucky not to be in Ukraine, “but seeing how polarized America has become—it makes me wonder about the way forward.”\n\nWhether these Americans will really leave remains to be seen. Charlie said his greatest hope is that he won’t have to. But he finds comfort in knowing that he has the option of escape if the worst ever comes to pass, and in the idea that if he does have to go, he won’t be alone. He said he tells his family members: “If it gets so bad that we feel the obligation to leave the country, we believe it’ll be bad enough that they’ll want to go as well.”",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer Is Cautious for a Reason",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "When I walked into Chuck Schumer’s Brooklyn apartment, he was puttering around in his socks. This wasn’t household policy, the 74-year-old Democratic Senate minority leader assured me, so there was no need for me to shed my shoes. But, as a gesture of hospitality, he asked, “Do you mind if I keep mine off?” I didn’t seem to have any actual say in the matter, and so minutes later, we were lounging on the L-shaped sofa in his study, as he discoursed on the color of the walls—call it terra-cotta—that he told me he really likes, but his wife, Iris, doesn’t.\n\nHe had invited me over because there was a hole in his schedule. This was supposed to be the week that he embarked on a multicity tour for his new book, Antisemitism in America: A Warning. The launch was going to be his literary bar mitzvah, where he would bask in the glory of publication. Schumer had poured himself into the project, forcing himself to write intimately about his career, his faith, and his actual bar mitzvah, an event that had come to feel like an omen. Then, as now, the outside world trampled his big moment, and Schumer disappointed loved ones at the very moment he hoped to reap their praise.\n\nAs he tells the story, he was scheduled to become a man, in the eyes of the Jewish community, on November 23, 1963—a case of terrible timing, because Lee Harvey Oswald killed the president a day earlier. Even though nobody was in the mood to celebrate anything, his family plowed ahead with the event. And in front of a mournful congregation, Schumer choked. He humiliatingly fumbled through his Torah portion and had no fun at the party that followed. His abiding memory of the day is his father arguing with the caterer to recoup the costs for the after-dinner drinks that never were served.\n\nFrom the April 2024 issue: The golden age of American Jews is ending\n\nSimilarly inopportune timing has wrecked the launch of his book. Days before its publication, he announced that he would be supporting a Republican continuing resolution that would prevent a government shutdown. The decision was wildly unpopular with his party’s rank and file, who accused him of squandering the Democrats’ last remaining source of leverage over the Trump administration.\n\nOn The Daily Show, Jon Stewart mocked him: “Senator Schumer, no disrespect, but you are a disgrace to Jewish stereotypes about financial negotiation.” Outside Schumer’s Park Slope apartment, on seemingly every mailbox and street sign, there were posters with his photo that read, Missing Backbone … If Found Contact Charles Schumer.\n\nSchumer’s security team began to track specific threats against him. They worried that the furor over the shutdown would create a wave of protests that would test their ability to safeguard him. So Schumer accepted advice that he postpone his tour for a more placid moment in the indeterminate future.\n\nWith newfound time on his hands, Schumer and I began to kibitz. He splayed on his sofa, tucked his stocking feet under his knees and propped his head on his hand, striking a Cleopatra pose. He badly wanted to talk about his neglected book and not the continuing resolution. But I began to realize that the two subjects were, in fact, woven together. The book is unintentionally a political self-portrait. Schumer’s Jewish identity is at the core of his beliefs: that the viability of public institutions should be defended at all costs; that the fragility of Jewish existence, and of democracy, demands that he resist emotionally satisfying gestures, if they ultimately risk damaging those institutions.\n\nFew American politicians are more unmistakably Jewish than Chuck Schumer. Soon after he joined the House of Representatives in the early 1980s, he recalls in the book, a woman in Queens rushed up to him: “You have more courage than any of the other members of Congress.” Schumer didn’t just take the compliment. He wanted to know why she was lavishing him with such praise. “You’re the only one who had the courage to wear a yarmulke,” she told him. To disabuse her of that idea, he bent down to show her “the appetizer-plate-sized bald spot”—his words—that she had confused for a skullcap.\n\nDespite the expectations Jews might have had for him, he didn’t define himself that way. He told me, “I was always proudly Jewish, but I never emphasized Jewishness. When I ran for the Senate, I was really worried. How would these upstate people react to me?” (Perhaps he need not have worried; he defeated the incumbent, Alfonse D’Amato, after an only-in-New-York controversy over whether the Republican senator had called Schumer a putzhead, a riff on the Yiddish slang for penis.)\n\nDecades passed, and his cautious attitude didn’t change. But then, on October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, and Schumer felt a new sense of responsibility. No Jew in American political life had ever held the power he then possessed. (The Democrats held a majority in the Senate, so he was running the chamber.) Witnessing the outpouring of anti-Semitism on the left, which focused its harshest criticisms on Israel rather than Hamas, Schumer felt compelled to fully embrace his identity, in all the ways he’d historically resisted.\n\nHis decision to expend so much time talking about anti-Semitism didn’t please his aides, who urged him to steer clear. On the political merits, his staff had valid arguments. Schumer planned on chastising the left, attacking members of the party he led. He writes that he was determined to make a fervent case for Israel, despite that country’s diminishing popularity among die-hard Democrats. He recalls telling himself, “You are no great Jewish sage or scholar, you are no King Solomon or Maimonides or Elie Wiesel, but for better or for worse, you are here, and you ought to try to do some good.”\n\nRead: Trump’s crocodile tears for the Jews\n\nWhat’s interesting about the book was that writing it didn’t just inspire him to more strongly identify himself as a Jew, but also prodded him to consider the Jewish roots of his approach to politics. (Full disclosure: At several points in his book, Schumer approvingly quotes an essay I wrote about Judaism in America.)\n\nHe began to think back to his time as a student at Harvard, in the late ’60s. Even though he protested against the Vietnam War, just like his classmates, he didn’t like how they took over buildings in the name of the movement. In the book, he recalls, “I was never going to be on the side of the radicals. I was going to take my own path and try to work through the system and get results, even if it meant compromise and concession from time to time.”\n\nSchumer’s recollections of that era mirror his current difference of opinion with his base over the government shutdown. “Even if I failed and they shut me down and some of them told me I was a sellout,” he writes, “I would try to convince them to seek progress with me on the issues we both cared about. It was more of a human principle and less of a political one.”\n\nWhen I brought up this passage, he told me that this human principle grew subconsciously, at least in part, from his Jewishness. Schumer viewed the preservation of American institutions as a matter of Jewish preservation, because those institutions were equipped to protect religious minorities. They were the source of America’s exceptional tolerance of Jews: “One of the great things about America is we’ve always had these norms, and we don’t want them broken,” he said, “because they protect all Americans, but particularly Jewish people, who have been so subject to problems and vilification through the centuries.”\n\nIn the past few weeks, many of the American institutions he reveres, and the constitutional system designed to insulate them, have come under intense pressure that they might not withstand. And, apropos of Schumer’s book, Trump has created conditions for anti-Semitism to flourish. The president has surrounded himself with a disturbing collection of appointees with records of repeating old canards about Jewish power.\n\nAs Schumer explained the president’s attitude toward Jews, he told me a story that he’d left out of the manuscript: After Trump came to office in 2017, he invited congressional leaders to meet with him. “There’s a spread in the White House, and the first thing he says to me is, ‘Chuck, have a pig in the blanket. They’re kosher.’ First, I’m not sure they were kosher. Second, what was he thinking? He’s a Jew.” (I reached out to the White House for comment on this anecdote and have not yet heard back.)\n\nTrump, in his autocratic mode, seemingly ascribed himself the power to determine what’s kosher and not. And more than that, he’s determined that he has the ability to determine who’s a Jew and not. Last week, he bizarrely declared that Schumer “is not Jewish anymore.” In the words of the president of the United States, “He has become a Palestinian.” (“Don’t tell my mother,” Schumer told me in response.)\n\nThe president was assuming a posture that rarely ends well, in which the regime separates the good Jews from the bad ones. By deeming them religious reprobates, the regime is signaling that they are the acceptable ones to abuse.\n\nDoes Schumer’s institutionalism have the fortitude to resist Trump? When he voted to prevent the government shutdown, he was acting not just on instinct, but on intelligence gleaned from Republican sources, who told him that the administration was baiting the Democrats into shutting down the government. The White House had a plan for how it would use the cover of a shutdown to accelerate its assault on the government, while pinning blame for the crisis on the Democrats.\n\nBut Schumer was also acting on instinct. As he remembers the radicals at Harvard, he says, “I saw how their zeal and fury led them to be not only demeaning to other students but disruptive, which was ultimately counterproductive. They turned too many people off.” In the end, he was right, and they were wrong. The backlash against antiwar protest helped doom ’60s liberalism, ending the Great Society and stalling the advance of civil rights.\n\nAs I sat with him on the sofa, I received an alert from Axios: “Schumer faces growing House Dem calls to step down.” But he seemed unfazed. “The higher you go on the mountain, the more fiercely the wind blows,” he told me. “The only way to protect yourself from these fierce winds is to have your own internal gyroscope. That’s what motivated me in how I voted.” The same instinct motivated him back at Harvard, he said. “I hated the Vietnam War, but I felt there was a right way.” He was now lying on his back, his feet propped up, the knot of his tie dangling at his torso, a man either oblivious to the revolt brewing against him or at ease with his own political choices.",

        "title": "Dr. Oz Is Now the Grown-Up in the Room",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The first time that Mehmet Oz was questioned by the Senate, in June 2014, the atmosphere was not inviting. He’d been hauled in to defend his habit of promoting unconventional supplements for weight loss, including green coffee beans, raspberry ketones, and an Asian tropical fruit called garcinia cambogia, on his daytime-television talk show. “I don’t get why you need to say this stuff,” Claire McCaskill, the Missouri senator who chaired the hearing, told him. “Because you know it’s not true.”\n\nLast Friday, Oz was back before the Senate, this time to be questioned as President Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In the interim, despite a turn to politics that included an unsuccessful bid to join the Senate himself, Oz has stayed the course: selling stress-relieving shrubs on social media, for instance, and leveraging his mother’s Alzheimer’s to pitch herbal remedies. Now a physician who was once described by other doctors in an open letter as demonstrating “an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain” may soon be tasked with regulating the health insurance of more than 150 million Americans. But the context of his return to Washington has cast the former TV star in a new, more flattering light: Next to some of the other appointees to the Department of Health and Human Services, even Dr. Oz seems safe and normal.\n\nI’ve had a front-row seat for Oz’s unlikely transformation from maligned to mainstream. In 2013, when I was still in medical school, I launched a public effort to censure him. His exuberant pitches for unproven remedies were harming patients, I contended. I asked medical societies to do more to combat the spread of misinformation. My efforts were rebuffed at first; doctors were worried about infringing on free speech and criticizing professional colleagues. To buttress my campaign, I started collecting anecdotes from viewers of The Dr. Oz Show describing potential harm caused by his advice.\n\nOz did not respond to any of these efforts at the time. (He also did not respond to a request for comment on this story.) His initial dressing-down in Congress followed soon after, and then in 2015, I helped a group of medical students and residents cajole the American Medical Association into writing guidelines for ethical physician conduct in the media. Oz himself remained unchastened after this previous run of bad press, though. “We will not be silenced. We will not give in,” he told his TV viewers in 2015, while accusing one group of critics of having industry ties and denying that he ever promoted treatments for personal gain. In short, he embraced his reputation as a wellness guru and anti-establishment truth teller—the sort of person who would find a natural home in the “Make America healthy again” movement that has been popularized by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nOz is likely to join Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services—and assume control of my parents’ health insurance, among so many others’—in the weeks ahead. That prospect would have terrified me in the 2010s, when I first watched him testify before the Senate. But when I saw him do so for a second time on Friday, he no longer struck me as a major threat. Rather, he looked like an anachronism: a charming celebrity physician with a penchant for theatrical claims. In the face of the Trump administration’s chaotic razing of the nation’s biomedical infrastructure, Oz’s brand of hucksterism seems relatively mild, even quaint.\n\nPerhaps that’s why the Senate showed so little interest in his history of hawking suspect treatments. Even Democrats went pretty easy with their questions. Senator Ron Wyden accused Oz of having engaged in “wellness grifting,” and Senator Maggie Hassan said he’d backed “unproven snake oil remedies,” but this was not a central focus of the hearing. “There are many things I said on the show,” Oz said in response. “I take great pride in the research we did at the time to identify which of these worked and which ones didn’t.”\n\nInstead of grilling Oz on his questionable supplement endorsements, the legislators mostly used their time to lobby for niche policy fixes, and Oz in turn displayed an expertise in health-care policy that seemed worthy of his Wharton MBA. He was fluent on the topics of pharmacy benefit managers, prior authorization, insurance payment models, and the Affordable Care Act. He came out in favor of work requirements for Medicaid—a conventionally conservative approach—while also making sure to show some sympathy for health-care consumers, calling the insurance companies that profit from excessive upcoding “scoundrels who are stealing from the vulnerable.”\n\nThis all came off as rather serious and boring, in the way that such a hearing really should come off. Compare that with the nomination hearings for Kennedy: When questioned by the Senate, he botched basic facts about Medicare and Medicaid, refused to admit that vaccines don’t cause autism, and accused committee members of being shills for pharmaceutical companies. Dave Weldon, who was Trump’s pick to run the CDC, didn’t even make it to his hearing, which was also scheduled for last week. Why Weldon’s nomination was withdrawn is not exactly clear, but it’s possible he made the error of being slightly too transparent about his suspicions of standard childhood vaccines. When positioned next to Kennedy and Weldon, or to Trump’s picks to run the NIH and the FDA, Oz seems quite conventional. He clearly stated that the measles shot is both safe and effective, while doing little to attach himself to the angry COVID contrarianism expressed by Kennedy and other nominees for leadership at HHS. (HHS did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nSo now we seem to have arrived at the strange moment when a celebrity TV doctor with no significant experience in public administration, a physician who once suggested that pineapple chunks and chia seeds were reasonable treatments for sciatica, can present himself as an unusually rational and stable candidate for leadership in the nation’s public-health establishment. Oz may even become an advocate for a more conventional approach to health-care policy in a department that is now run by someone who touts the benefits of treating measles with cod liver oil. Improbably, the “green coffee beans” guy is poised to be the grown-up in the room.",

        "title": "What the JFK File Dump Actually Revealed",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "In 1962, the CIA had a driver’s license made for one of its officers, James P. O’Connell. It gave him an alias: James Paul Olds. We know this because the document containing the information was released to the public in 2017—part of an effort to declassify information related to John F. Kennedy’s assassination. But now, thanks to an executive order from President Donald Trump calling for the release of all the classified information pertaining to the incident, we know a bit more. It was, specifically, a California driver’s license.\n\nThis is an irrelevant detail in an irrelevant document. As far as anyone knows, O’Connell had nothing to do with the assassination; the inclusion of his story was probably just a by-product of an overly broad records request. But there it was on Tuesday evening, when the National Archives and Record Administration uploaded to its website about 63,400 pages of “JFK Assassination Records.” Given Trump’s order, the release of all this information sounded dramatic, but much of what has been revealed is about as interesting as that driver’s-license detail. Many of these documents were already public with minor redactions, and many of them have almost nothing to do with the Kennedy assassination and never did. This is why the Assassination Records Review Board, which processed them in the 1990s, labeled so many of them “Not Believed Relevant.”\n\nHundreds of thousands of such documents have been released since the ’90s, including thousands released during Trump’s first term and the Biden administration. (This is thanks to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which was passed in response to overwhelming public interest in the case after the release of the Oliver Stone movie JFK.) But one of Trump’s 2024 campaign promises was to release all the rest; he said that it was “time for the American people to know the TRUTH!” His health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—John Kennedy’s nephew—has been animated about the issue and framed the secrecy around the last files as evidence to support his conspiratorial view of history.\n\nRead: RFK Jr. won. Now what?\n\nThere are still some documents that the Archives could not make public, because they are subject to IRS privacy laws or because they come from sealed grand-jury proceedings. These may come out eventually, but they will likely follow the same drip, drip, drip as all the rest. It seems possible that the public’s curiosity will never be fully satisfied, at least in my lifetime. A new batch will always come out, but there will always be something left.\n\nI’m one of the people who cares a lot about the Kennedy assassination. I’m currently finishing a book about the case. On principle, and out of selfish personal interest, I agree that the government should make all of the documents public if it can. Of course I scanned this new batch to see whether there was anything exciting. There wasn’t, but some of it was kind of funny.\n\nIn many cases, the removed redactions reveal proper nouns that a reader could have easily inferred before or that seem totally inconsequential. For instance, there is a 1974 memo about the Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt’s history with the CIA. A previously released version of the document mentions that the Office of Finance had asked a CIA station whether Hunt had received payments from it while he was living in Madrid. We did not know which station had been asked. Now we know it was the Madrid station. (Wow!) A 1977 document about the New York Times reporter Tad Szulc includes a rumor about Szulc being a Communist; in previous versions of the document, this information was “apparently from a [REDACTED] source.” With the redaction removed, we now know that it was “apparently from a British source.”\n\nSome of it was less funny. The files also contain the unredacted personal information—including Social Security numbers—of dozens of people, seemingly published accidentally, though the National Archives site now suggests this was an inevitable result of the transparency effort. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged the problem to The New York Times on Thursday, saying, “At the request of the White House, the National Archives and the Social Security Administration immediately put together an action plan to proactively help individuals whose personal information was released in the files.” The National Archives did not respond to my request for comment.\n\nIn my scan, I came across the late-’70s personnel files of dozens of staff members of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, all of which contained Social Security numbers. A good number of those people are likely still alive. The document dump contains the Social Security number of a journalist who was active in the anti-war movement during the ’60s. There are, by my count, 19 documents about his personal life and employment history; none of the documents about him appears to have the faintest relevance to the assassination. Bizarrely, the new release also contains an unredacted arrest record for a Dealey Plaza witness who testified in front of the Warren Commission in 1964. This record—for the alleged theft of a car in 1970—has nothing whatsoever to do with the assassination of President Kennedy. Yet it is reproduced in full and it includes the man’s Social Security number and a full set of his fingerprints.\n\nFrom the February 1964 issue: A eulogy for John F. Kennedy\n\nRelatively few of the documents even mention Kennedy. I saw only one addressed to him: a June 30, 1961, memo from his special assistant, confidant, and eventual biographer, Arthur Schlesinger about the growing power of the CIA. Most of it has been public since 2018, but the version released on Tuesday removed a final redaction about the agency’s extensive use of State Department jobs as cover for its agents. Schlesinger informed Kennedy that about 1,500 CIA agents abroad had State-provided cover stories at the time—too many, in his opinion; he wrote that “the effect is to further the CIA encroachment on the traditional functions of State.” The Paris embassy had 128 CIA people in it at the time, he added as an example. “CIA occupies the top floor of the Paris Embassy, a fact well known locally; and on the night of the Generals’ revolt in Algeria, passersby noted with amusement that the top floor was ablaze with lights.” Again, this is at best “kind of interesting” and at most trivia. It doesn’t meaningfully affect the historical understanding of President Kennedy’s tense relationship with the CIA, which is very well documented elsewhere.\n\nAfter decades of releases, it may be that these are the only kinds of secrets the Archives still hold about the Kennedy assassination—tiny bits of color on things that are already well understood and boring details about people whose connections to the event are minimal if they even exist. But there’s no way to know until we see everything … if we see everything, if we ever can. Even then, when the count of secret things ticks down to zero, how will we know that was really, really all? We won’t, of course. We never will.",

The original animated film was such a massive success when it was first released in 1937 that it more or less invented the genre of not just the Disney princess movie, but also the Disney feature-length animated movie, and all the copies thereof that followed. Some of the tropes it innovated are still fundamental to what we think an animated movie should look like, for no better reason than the fact that Snow White did them nearly 90 years ago.\n\nRelated How Disney found itself in the middle of a culture war\n\nIn response, Disney has tamped down its marketing machine, restricting press on the red carpet, sending its leading ladies to exclusively friendly outlets, and offering a reduced window for ticket sales compared to previous live-action releases. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that, for Hollywood insiders, Disney’s attitude screams, “We need to get this thing over with. … We have zero faith.”\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

In defining the genre, it also shaped childhood for generations of Americans. The Walt Disney Corporation might be the house that Mickey Mouse built, but he did it on Snow White’s dime.\n\nHow Snow White went from “Disney’s Folly” to Disney’s greatest success\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs advertisement, 1937.\n\nFrom the outside, Snow White had all the makings of a boondoggle. No one had ever made a feature-length animated film before it, and looking at the silly, squishy, fluorescent cartoons of the era, it was hard to imagine why anyone would want to sit through one that lasted over an hour. Cartoons are good for a giggle, but who wants one that stretches on forever? Still, Walt Disney was determined to make an animated feature that would be easy to sit through, that would have genuine artistic merit. Getting the medium to that point would prove to be expensive.\n\nThroughout the 1930s, Disney turned his animation studio into what was essentially a laboratory for how to make a great animated film. He had long considered his “Silly Symphony” shorts to be the artistic cousin to the slapstick Mickey Mouse shorts, and now he was taking them more seriously than ever. He poured money into figure drawing lessons for his animators, into classes on the art of the great European fairy tale illustrators, into studies on how the play of light should look in animation. He paid for huge and expensive leaps forward in technology, most notoriously the creation of a multi-plane camera that allowed for new levels of depth and perspective within a single frame.\n\nWalt Disney was determined to make an animated feature that would be easy to sit through, that would have genuine artistic merit.\n\nIn the end, Snow White cost $1.5 million in 1937 dollars, about $34 million today. Newspapers of the time called Snow White “Disney’s folly.” Instead, when Snow White made it to theaters, it became a smash hit.\n\nAudiences reportedly burst into tears when they saw Snow White lying in the glass coffin, surrounded by weeping dwarves. The premiere was greeted with a standing ovation. Sergei Eisenstein, the Soviet director who invented montage, declared it “the greatest film ever made.” It grossed $66 million at the box office, becoming briefly the highest-grossing sound picture ever until Gone with the Wind premiered two years later.\n\nBefore Snow White, no one had ever managed to make animation so naturalistic and expressive. The animation in short films up until that point had been silly, vaudeville-inflected; mostly featuring animals because humans were too hard to draw in an appealing way — mostly with static and unchanging expressions, on flat, simplistic backgrounds. But Snow White took place in a deep, rich, painterly world, and Snow White herself was a charming, beautiful human figure who could blush and laugh and cry in ways that made the audience blush and laugh and cry right back at her. It was an entirely new effect, one to which people responded powerfully.\n\nOne surprising thing In the 1937 Snow White, not all the human characters were as naturalistic as Walt Disney would have liked. The Prince’s role was minimized as much as possible because Disney felt they could never quite get his face right. Watch it again and you’ll see what he meant.\n\nBut Snow White also had commercial appeal in a way that seemed to flummox Disney, and that took him a while to figure out how to duplicate. He continued developing Snow White’s animation style over his next two features, 1940’s Pinocchio and Fantasia, both of which arguably surpassed Snow White in artistic accomplishment — but also failed to make money. The massive success of Snow White bought Disney enough credit that he could keep taking out loans to finance his ever-more-expensive films, but after Fantasia, the company was near bankruptcy.\n\nDisney made Dumbo (1941) and Bambi (1942) on the cheap, abandoning the expensive oil painting look of his first three films for a more stylized, pencil-stroke-heavy animation style that could be churned out quickly. The company kept floating through World War II on the strength of a series of military propaganda films, but it wouldn’t achieve a true box office smash again until 1950, when it released Cinderella, a movie that followed carefully in the footsteps of Snow White.\n\nIn a world where the two highest-grossing Disney films were Snow White and Cinderella, the matter became settled: A successful Disney movie would look like Snow White. Even today, after Pixar, after fully rendered animation, after Frozen, it still does.\n\nHow Disney learned the Snow White formula\n\nA Snow White character acts in Mickey’s Soundsational Parade at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, on Friday, May 24, 2013. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nDisney occasionally messes with the formula, but the great classics of the studio tend to follow this basic template set by Snow White 90 years ago.\n\nSnow White was a musical because commercial films in 1937 were musicals. In today’s Hollywood, musicals aren’t commercial guarantees, but we still think of music as being fundamental to the Disney formula. Snow White begins the movie by wishing for her prince to come and the prince singing back to her — now Disney movies tend to give their protagonist an “I want” song and the lovers a duet. Snow White doesn’t have a villain song, but the Evil Queen is so fabulously campy that songs like “Poor Unfortunate Souls” are a natural extension of the legacy she began.\n\nNot all Disney animated movies are about princesses or even based on fairy tales, but in unprofitable periods, Disney generally turns to a princess to turn things around. The Little Mermaid in 1989 rocketed the studio out of its so-called dark age and into the Disney Renaissance, and after a slump in the 2000s, Disney leaned hard into the princess formula with The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, and Frozen. Disney fairy tales tend to be gently bowdlerized and made sentimental (Snow White didn’t wake up because of true love’s kiss until Disney got their hands on her), and to this day, the studio loves adding a didactic moral lesson to their tales, like the lesson in Snow White that love conquers all.\n\nSnow White had cute animal sidekicks as well as comic magical ones; both would become a staple of Disney storytelling going forward. Snow White’s blue and yellow and red gown would become her signature outfit, an increasingly important piece of Disney’s visual iconography and of the princesses that followed. Snow White even innovated the classic Disney strategy of keeping the hero’s hands clean by having the villain die accidentally, falling from a great height in the middle of a crescendo of evil laughter.\n\nWhat Disney left behind following Snow White were some of its most stylized elements. At moments, the animation plays with the jagged, aggressive lines of German Expressionism: When Snow White runs into the wild forest, the trees loom out of the darkness and the eyes of wild animals flash at her in lurid, vicious cuts. Disney would continue to play with this aesthetic in Pinocchio and Fantasia, which is part of why they are largely considered to be his scariest films, but later animated features would smooth out such frightening scenes into gentler, less thrilling action sequences.\n\nDisney would also abandon the part of Snow White that plays most strangely for modern audiences. As critic Caroline Siede has written, Snow White is constructed like a classical opera or a ballet, with static, unchanging characters. You might think of Snow White as a figure like Pamina, the ingenue in The Magic Flute: she’s at the center of the plot, but all she does is fall in love over the course of a single duet, and she never really changes after that. Her funny magic sidekick and villainous mother figure steal the show. In later films, Disney would embrace a more cinematic style of storytelling, with characters who want more than true love and who have to overcome some internal flaw in order to get what they want.\n\nThe first Snow White was like nothing that anyone had ever seen before. The new Snow White is a cinematic cliche.\n\nThe new live-action Snow White plays as an uncanny attempt to retroactively apply this formula to Disney’s oldest and strongest story. In the new film, Snow White wants to protect her kingdom from the selfish Evil Queen, but to save the day, she has to overcome her fear and self-doubt. She still sings “Waiting on a Wish” by the wishing well, but now she sings about how much she wants to be brave. All the updates are so generic that in the end, the whole thing reads as storytelling by committee.\n\nYet as Disney attempts to update its storytelling, it leaves behind the part of Snow White that had those first audiences sobbing in their seats: that ravishing, painterly, glorious hand-drawn animation. The first Snow White was like nothing that anyone had ever seen before. The new Snow White is a cinematic cliché.",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox. He covers a wide range of political and policy issues with a special focus on questions that internally divide the American left and right. Before coming to Vox in 2024, he wrote a column on politics and economics for New York Magazine.\n\nWhen a Democrat contemplates their nation’s biggest problems today, minimum lot sizes in suburban housing codes probably don’t rank very high on the list.\n\nBut a new book asks Democrats to do precisely that. In Abundance, journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson catalog American liberalism’s failures to deliver material plenty — the housing shortages that plague blue cities, the green infrastructure that congressional Democrats funded but then failed to actually build, the high-speed rail system that California promised but never delivered. Klein and Thompson argue that these disappointments have a common source: Since the 1970s, American liberals have been more concerned with obstructing harmful economic development than promoting the beneficial kind. Democrats have prioritized process over outcomes and favored stasis over growth, most notably through their support for zoning restrictions, stringent environmental laws, and attaching costly conditions to public infrastructure spending.\n\nRelated This is why Kamala Harris really lost\n\nTo revitalize American progressivism, they sketch an “abundance agenda”: a series of regulatory reforms and public investment programs aimed at facilitating higher rates of housing development, infrastructure construction, and technological progress.\n\nKlein and Thompson speak for a broader faction of “abundance liberals,” which encompasses the Yes in My Backyard (YIMBY) movement, various pro-innovation think tanks, and scores of commentators. In addition to Abundance, the faction has recently produced two other books outlining its critique of American liberalism’s evolution since the 1970s, Why Nothing Works by Marc Dunkelman and Stuck by Yoni Appelbaum.\n\nIt is surely true that blue states’ governance failures are not this moment’s most pressing crisis. But Democratic areas’ inability to avert cost-of-living crises — or to build infrastructure on time and budget — is a political liability for the party. Such mismanagement has not only called liberals’ competence into question, but also chased millions of people out of large blue states and into red ones over the past 10 years.\n\nCalifornia and New York have been shrinking while Florida and Texas have been growing — trends that will make it much harder for Democrats to win the Electoral College or Congress after the 2030 census. Disempowering an increasingly authoritarian GOP should be Democrats’ top priority in 2025. But bringing abundant housing, energy, and infrastructure to blue states is conducive to that task. This makes Klein and Thompson’s analysis politically relevant.\n\nNevertheless, not everyone on the left buys what they’re selling. And Abundance has some real flaws.\n\nIn their concern with winning over progressive skeptics, Klein and Thompson sometimes elide the genuine tradeoffs between their vision and progressive ideology. For example, while they lament the stifling impact of various environmental regulations on housing and clean energy construction, they’re cagey about precisely how, and how much, they want to change such laws. Rather than stating plainly that they’re willing to reduce regulatory obstacles to fossil fuel infrastructure for the sake of abetting the build-out of renewables — a position Klein has endorsed in his New York Times column — they argue that going into details about how environmental laws should be amended would be beside the point, since “no individual law” would solve all the problems they identify and “What is needed here is a change in political culture, not just legislation.” Such slipperiness may make Abundance more palatable to progressives, but also invites distrust.\n\nThis said, much of the left’s criticism of abundance liberalism is off-base and unfair. One especially prominent charge is that the abundance agenda entails a retreat from the progressive movement’s commitments to economic justice and equality. In this account, Klein and Thompson want Democrats to stop catering to the particular needs of poor and working-class Americans — through expansions of social welfare programs or labor regulations — and start concentrating on maximizing economic growth.\n\nThe New Yorker’s Benjamin Wallace-Wells writes that the abundance movement views stagnation as a “national emergency” that requires “liberals to sideline their quest for a Scandinavian-style social democracy.” And he fears that the pursuit of Klein and Thompson’s vision could yield a less equitable society.\n\nWallace-Wells nevertheless endorses some aspects of the abundance agenda. Other critics are less measured. Dylan Gyauch-Lewis argues in the American Prospect that abundance liberals prize “growth above all,” and that their ideology is merely a repackaging of “free-market dogma.”\n\nLikewise, The Baffler’s Alex Bronzini-Vender derides the abundance agenda as a “Koch-funded initiative” aimed at “reversing the Democratic Party’s skepticism of neoliberal orthodoxy.”\n\nThese criticisms are off-base in more ways than one.\n\nFirst, it’s simply not true that Klein and Thompson call on liberals to abandon welfare state expansion or to pursue growth at all costs. They explicitly state that “redistribution is important” — their argument isn’t that expanding the safety net is undesirable, but rather, that doing so is insufficient for maximizing ordinary Americans’ living standards.\n\nFurther, Abundance argues that the federal government should play a larger role in managing the economy, so as to accelerate the development of socially valuable technologies and steer economic growth in an ecologically friendly direction. To say that Klein, Thompson, and other abundance liberals are free market dogmatists because they oppose some regulations is a bit like saying Joe Manchin is a Stalinist because he opposes Medicare cuts.\n\nBut those who critique the abundance agenda on egalitarian grounds are making a more fundamental analytical error: Combating regulatory obstacles to housing construction, infrastructure, and energy production is not just compatible with prioritizing the interests of working-class Americans; it is synonymous with that task. An economic system biased toward scarcity and stagnation is one that serves the already comfortable better than the disadvantaged.\n\nThe left’s suspicions of abundance liberalism are understandable. On a variety of fronts, Klein and Thompson call for paring back rules and regulations that are coded as progressive, in the name of abetting faster economic development. The left is used to denouncing this general proposition.\n\nYet abundance liberals are not calling on Democrats to forsake genuinely progressive restrictions on production, such as the Clean Air Act or minimum wage, for the sake of maximizing GDP. Rather, they are imploring their party to judge regulations on the basis of results rather than vibes. Rules that ostensibly subordinate free markets to the public good — but actually undermine ordinary Americans’ living standards — are not worth defending.\n\nRelated The surprising theory that explains modern American life\n\nWhy Democrats should make priority-setting a priority\n\nSuch regulations fall into a few broad categories.\n\nOne consists of seemingly progressive — but ultimately counterproductive — mandates appended to public spending. In recent decades, liberals have gotten accustomed to using government-funded projects as vehicles for delivering “wins” (however minor or symbolic) to their coalition’s myriad stakeholders. Yet as Democratic legislators multiply the number of different causes a discrete project is supposed to serve, they often undermine their policy’s core purpose.\n\nSan Francisco’s approach to public housing is one of Abundance’s signature examples of this phenomenon. The Golden Gate City suffers from one of the highest homelessness rates in the United States. Increasing the supply of publicly subsidized housing should therefore be one of its government’s priorities.\n\nYet the city’s public housing policy is not designed to maximize the number of affordable homes in San Francisco — but rather, to build some affordable homes, while promoting small businesses, signaling concern for disabled people, improving the aesthetic quality of the city’s architecture, increasing employment among local construction workers, and furthering a wide array of other liberal causes.\n\nThe rules that San Francisco has attached to its affordable housing program may sound progressive on their face. The city reserves publicly subsidized housing contracts for small builders, in a bid to combat the power of big developers. It also requires public housing projects to pass a review by the Mayor’s Office of Disability and the San Francisco Arts Commission, hire locally, buy power from the city’s public utility, and meet a panoply of other criteria.\n\nBut each of these provisions increases the costs of construction. Prohibiting large contractors from building affordable homes leads to delays, as there are only so many small construction companies in the Bay Area and each has limited capacity, by definition. Ensuring that housing is accessible for the disabled is surely vital. Yet all housing projects in the United States must already be compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act; mandating an additional review by the San Francisco Mayor’s Office just adds a redundant layer of bureaucratic processing. And while pretty buildings are preferable to the alternative, when thousands of San Franciscans are going unhoused, architectural aesthetics should take a backseat to rapidly growing the affordable housing stock.\n\nTaken together, these little rules add tens of millions of dollars to the price of every affordable housing project in the city. The typical publicly subsidized apartment building in San Francisco takes more than 6 years to build and costs more than $600,000 per unit. By contrast, a private philanthropy in the city recently erected 145 studio apartments for the chronically homeless in three years, at a cost of just $400,000 per unit. This efficiency is derived largely from the fact that privately funded housing projects don’t need to comply with as many requirements as public projects do.\n\nSaying that San Francisco should cut red tape in its affordable housing program may sound like a conservative sentiment. But in its actual effects, that red tape is reducing the supply of affordable housing while reinforcing the impression that the government cannot build things as competently as the private sector. These do not seem like progressive outcomes.\n\nThe progressive case for a freer housing market\n\nAbundance liberals tell a similar story about zoning restrictions.\n\nAmerican municipalities in general — and Democratic ones in particular — heavily restrict the types of housing that the private sector can build. It is illegal to construct anything but a detached single-family home on roughly 75 percent of America’s residential land. Local laws add various other cost-increasing limitations on housing development, from large minimum lot sizes to parking mandates to design requirements.\n\nThe progressive case against restrictive zoning is straightforward: Affluent suburbs use single-family zoning to keep out working-class families, who might be able to afford an apartment in their municipalities but can’t shoulder the expense of a large house with a yard.\n\nMore broadly, making it illegal to build multi-family housing in most of the country ensures scarcity. According to some estimates, America has 4.5 million fewer homes than its people require. This shortage increases the value of our nation’s existing housing stock — which is good for homeowners and landlords but bad for renters. A policy that benefits those who own property at the expense of those who don’t is regressive by any definition.\n\nMany progressives have accepted the force of this argument. But some further to the left still disdain the push to liberalize zoning laws. And their aversion to that project is not difficult to understand. The idea that one of America’s biggest economic problems can be mitigated by loosening restrictions on free enterprise is ideologically unpalatable for many.\n\nBronzini-Vender’s essay in The Baffler well illustrates many leftists’ allergy to this argument. In it, he argues that abundance liberals are selling the public a fiction: Unleashing homebuilders from “zoning regulations” would increase Americans’ living standards, since the “private sector would supply more goods at lower costs—if only it could.”\n\nHe suggests this simply is not plausible and “betrays a deep misunderstanding of capitalist production”: Firms do not want prices to fall as that would erode their profit margins, so they will choke off production long before it starts substantially increasing affordability.\n\nThere are a few problems with this reasoning. The first is empirical. Capitalist production has, in fact, routinely yielded more goods at lower costs. Since 2000, the prices of durable consumer goods in the US have fallen by roughly 25 percent.\n\nAnd in the realm of housing specifically, zoning reforms have led to increased production and greater affordability. In Minneapolis, the lifting of various zoning restrictions in 2018 was followed by a surge in housing construction and a decline in the city’s median rent: Adjusted for local earnings, a home in Minneapolis was 20 percent cheaper in 2023 than it had been in 2017. In New Zealand, the city of Auckland’s experiment with zoning liberalization yielded similar results.\n\nThe second problem with Bronzini-Vender’s argument is theoretical. It assumes that the only way capitalist competition can yield lower prices is by forcing companies to accept lower profit margins. And since developers do not want their profits to fall, he reasons that they will tacitly collude to limit housing production, irrespective of zoning laws.\n\nThis is not a sound economic analysis. If you reduce how much it costs to produce a unit of housing — by legalizing apartment buildings or eliminating expensive regulatory requirements — then developers can charge lower prices while keeping their margins constant.\n\nFurther, firms can outcompete each other on price — without forfeiting profitability — if they increase their productivity. Durable goods have not become cheaper over the past quarter century because manufacturers and retailers have become more altruistic or less profitable, but rather because they’ve increased the amount of stuff they can supply per worker hour. (Some of this productivity increase is the result of outsourcing production to low-wage countries, but much of it is from innovations in production and logistics.)\n\nOne surprising thing The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the federal government to draft statements analyzing the environmental impacts of its decisions. When the law was first enacted, these statements were as short as 10 pages. Today, the average one is 600 pages long.\n\nAs Klein and Thompson note, between 1935 and 1970, construction productivity steadily rose in the US. But over the past half-century, it has actually fallen. Zoning reform could plausibly reverse that trend by making it easier to mass produce sections of housing in factories, a process known as modular construction; as is, in order to conform with housing regulations, builders typically need to construct homes almost entirely onsite.\n\nMere deregulation will not ensure universal housing affordability. It will never be profitable to provide housing to low-income people, in the absence of public subsidies. And the private sector is liable to underproduce housing for middle-income people as well. The government can help fill in these gaps by creating public developers, which build market-rate housing and then reinvest their proceeds into new construction (the left flank of the abundance movement has been popularizing the public developer model for years now).\n\nNevertheless, the private sector could produce far more housing than it does, were it not for regulatory restrictions. A freer housing market would therefore make America richer and more equal. This fact may make some progressives uncomfortable. But defending our favorite ideological abstractions should not take precedence over improving people’s lives.\n\nRelated The housing movement is divided against itself\n\nNot all environmental regulations are worth defending\n\nMost controversially, abundance liberals argue that some environmental regulations are undermining shared prosperity, trust in government, and the green transition.\n\nTheir complaint is not with environmental laws that directly constrain pollution, such as the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act. The issue lies primarily with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its state-level equivalents. NEPA does not actually ban any pollutant or set any specific constraints on industrial production. Rather, the law mandates a process: Federal bureaucracies need to consider the environmental impact of their decisions, and draft statements outlining those impacts.\n\nAs Dunkelman explains, the law was intended merely to encourage government agencies to contemplate ecological concerns before greenlighting various projects, not to reduce their autonomy over such decisions. But activist lawyers took an expansive interpretation of the statute: In their view, if the government’s environmental impact statement underestimated the ecological implications of a given project, then private citizens and community groups could sue to block that project in court. And a series of judicial rulings enshrined this interpretation of the law.\n\nMany states proceeded to draft their own versions of NEPA, some of which applied its requirements to private projects as well as public ones. The effect was to render economic development of all kinds slower and more expensive. To ward off litigation, governments were forced to make their environmental impact statements lengthy and exhaustive: When the law was first enacted, those statements were as short as 10 pages. In 2022, the average one ran 600 pages long and took four and a half years to complete.\n\nAnd once completed, those statements still need to make it through a legal gauntlet before the ground on a given project can actually be broken.\n\nAll this has made building infrastructure in the US radically more expensive. Between the 1960s and 1980s, the cost of building a mile of interstate highway in America tripled. Mass transit was similarly impacted. It cost New York $2.6 billion to construct each mile of its Second Avenue Subway. By contrast, at around the same time, social democratic Copenhagen built a rail line for just $323 million per mile, and Paris built one for $320 million per mile.\n\nNEPA and its state-level equivalents also inhibit housing construction: In Berkeley, California, locals delayed the building of new undergraduate dorms through a three-year-long lawsuit, in which they argued that the project violated the California Environmental Quality Act, since enabling more college students to live in Berkeley would increase noise pollution.\n\nThis state of affairs undermines trust in the public sector’s competence, while making infrastructure and housing more expensive, raising tax burdens, and slowing economic growth.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s complacency about these outcomes bespeaks an insensitivity to working-class priorities and interests. According to some leftwing narratives, Democrats took an ideological turn in the 1970s, one that led them to sacrifice the interests of blue-collar Americans to the pursuit of “growth at all costs.” But on some policy fronts, this gets the story backward. Democrats became less committed to economic growth in the seventies, largely because they started prioritizing educated middle-class people’s ideological and quality-of-life concerns over the material interests of working people.\n\nThe environmental movement of the 1970s was overwhelmingly comprised of economically comfortable college graduates, many of whom regarded economic growth as undesirable and unsustainable, a position rejected by the vast majority of working-class voters. As political scientist Ronald Inglehart showed, blue-collar Americans were much less likely than their more affluent compatriots to prioritize environmental concerns over economic ones.\n\nAnd working-class voters’ priorities were well-founded: The costs of a regulatory system biased toward stasis and scarcity are more burdensome for those who do not yet enjoy material security than for those who do. As civil rights icon and trade unionist Bayard Rustin lamented in 1976, “the vanguard of the environmental movement, themselves members largely of the upper classes, have often sought policies that are clearly detrimental, and in some cases—the growth controversy being the most significant example—destructive to the needs of those less better off.”\n\nMany of the environmental movement’s achievements were laudable, and greatly improved and extended the lives of ordinary Americans. And the harms of NEPA aren’t all attributable to earnest environmentalists: Well-heeled interests have exploited the law to obstruct all manner of economic development. Yet refusing to pare back the scope of NEPA and similar laws in light of such abuse was a choice — one that constrained economic opportunity and diminished the federal government’s capacity to build public works.\n\nWhat makes NEPA and its ilk particularly perverse in the present moment, however, is that they are making America’s greatest ecological challenge — climate change — more difficult to meet.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: Building a clean energy economy requires constructing gargantuan amounts of new infrastructure (vast solar installations, wind farms, transmission lines, and geothermal plants, among other things). Maintaining a carbon economy, by contrast, requires building scarcely any, since the existing energy system is built around the needs and capacities of fossil fuels. A regulatory regime that favors the status quo is therefore one that favors fossil fuels. As of 2021, NEPA reviews were holding up twice as many green projects as carbon energy ones. According to an analysis cited by Klein and Thompson, 95 percent of energy projects that are looking to connect to the grid — but which are as yet obstructed by permitting — consist of solar, battery storage, or wind power.\n\nThe abundance agenda is a starting point\n\nPro-growth deregulatory policies are not sufficient for achieving shared prosperity. Indeed, such proposals aren’t even adequate for realizing Klein and Thompson’s vision for “abundance,” which also entails increasing government funding for technological development, among other things.\n\nBut loosening some regulatory restrictions on housing and infrastructure development would directly advance many progressive economic goals — while indirectly making it easier to expand the social welfare state. After all, higher economic growth translates into higher government revenues, which can then be redistributed to the economically disadvantaged. The abundance agenda is also compatible with increasing workers’ bargaining power through sectoral bargaining (even as there exist some genuine conflicts between the narrow interests of discrete unions and the achievement of material plenty).\n\nAbundance is directed at a progressive audience and aimed at winning an argument internal to blue America. In the current moment, this may strike some readers as myopic. Even if all progressives decided tomorrow to prioritize making it easier for the federal government to do big things, Elon Musk would still be gutting its capacity to execute its most basic functions. Even if permitting issues weren’t stymying the green transition, Donald Trump would be.\n\nAnd Klein and Thompson do not fully grapple with the challenge that the GOP’s radicalization poses to their ambitions. Much of the abundance agenda is aimed at increasing the administrative state’s power, at the expense of the judiciary’s. This strikes me as indispensable for realizing liberalism’s long-term goals. But today, it would entail giving Trump and Musk an even freer hand to reshape government to their reactionary whims.\n\nNevertheless, abundance liberalism remains relevant. The MAGA movement is not the reason why New York can’t build enough housing, California can’t build high-speed rail, and Massachusetts can’t build a transmission line between its cities and Quebec’s hydropower plants. Democrats have full control of government in some of America’s largest and wealthiest states. They have the power to prove that they can deliver rising living standards and falling costs for ordinary people.\n\nThere are many reasons why blue states have had such limited success on these fronts. But one is that progressives have not mounted a unified front against zoning restrictions that help landlords gouge tenants, environmental laws that enable rich NIMBYs to block renewable energy, and liberal policies that seek to advance so many disparate priorities that they end up achieving none. With any luck, Abundance will bring us a little closer to such a consensus.",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox covering foreign policy and world news with a focus on the future of international conflict. He is the author of the 2018 book, Invisible Countries: Journeys to the Edge of Nationhood , an exploration of border conflicts, unrecognized countries, and changes to the world map.\n\nElon Musk has opinions on how a lot of the world’s countries should be run.\n\nBut one country tends to get a pass from the world’s richest man. He is, in his own words, “kind of pro-China.” The self-proclaimed “free-speech absolutist” has not applied that position to China’s draconian censorship regime, and Musk has defended the Chinese government’s positions on a range of other issues.\n\nFrom a business perspective, this makes sense. China is vital to Musk’s car company Tesla as both a producer of vehicles and as a consumer market. Musk is also hardly unusual among major global tech CEOs in defending China.\n\n“Musk’s comments on China aren’t out of the norm for the CEO of a major Western business,” said Isaac Stone Fish, CEO of Strategy Risks, a consultancy focused on the risks of doing business in China. “The distinction is that [Apple CEO] Tim Cook is not on Twitter talking about how awful USAID is or meddling in European politics.”\n\nMusk’s business interests in China and overall pro-Beijing attitudes also stand out among his new colleagues in the Trump administration. Trump’s foreign policy team is generally united in its hawkish views on China. Trump himself has accused Beijing in the past of a policy to “rape our country” and blamed it for the Covid pandemic, along with a host of other ills.\n\nAs the US and China appear to be hurtling headlong into a trade war, and even as Trump seeks a meeting with China’s Xi Jinping in hopes of hammering out a new trade deal, Musk’s ties to China — and the potential leverage they could offer Beijing in future negotiations — are getting more notice in both countries.\n\nThis week, several media outlets reported, citing US officials, that Musk was due to be briefed on the US military’s classified plans for a war with China — unusual for any civilian outside the military chain of command, much less one with extensive commercial ties to the adversary in question. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth denied that the meeting would concern war plans and Musk described the report as “maliciously false information.\n\nDuring the recent quasi-infomercial on the White House lawn, during which Trump purchased a Tesla and made a sales pitch for the slumping company, the president made clear that the profits of Musk’s companies will be a priority for the administration. This raises questions about whether the interests of those companies will come into play as the administration shapes its policies toward its fellow superpower.\n\nChina and Tesla need each other\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between Tesla and China almost can’t be overstated. In 2019, the company opened its Shanghai “gigafactory” with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans from Chinese banks. It was the company’s first factory outside the US, as well as the first wholly foreign-owned car company in China, where automakers typically enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies.\n\nIt is now Tesla’s largest factory, producing half of the company’s cars globally last year. Musk has praised workers at his Chinese factory for “burning the 3 am oil…whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.” The remark came at a time when the factory was literally having workers sleep in the factory due to Covid restrictions.\n\nTesla has also benefited from selling cars in China’s fast-growing electric vehicle market: Sales in China rose 8.8 percent in 2024, a year in which the company’s global sales fell for the first time. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n“It’s their second most important market and the only market that’s continuing to grow,’” said Tu Le, an expert on the Chinese car market and director of the market research firm Sino Auto Insights.\n\nAlong the way, Musk has developed relationships with senior Chinese leaders, notably Premier Li Qiang, China’s No. 2 official, who reportedly offered him a Chinese green card during a meeting in 2019.\n\nThanks to his real-life Tony Stark image, Musk has become something of a pop culture figure in China, as, perhaps more surprisingly, has his mother.\n\nElon Musk books displayed during the Shanghai Book Fair 2024 in Shanghai, China. Ying Tang/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThe relationship between the Chinese government and Tesla has been mutually beneficial, Le told Vox. The company’s investment in China came at a time when the Chinese government was trying to spur the creation of a local market for electric vehicles. That effort worked phenomenally well: More than half of cars sold in China now come with distinctive green license plates marking them as EVs, and China accounted for more than 60 percent of EV sales globally last year.\n\nThis has also led to an explosion of new domestic Chinese EV producers, including Tesla’s primary competitor BYD, a company that Musk once literally laughed at but which now outsells Tesla globally.\n\nTesla retains some cachet as a premium brand, Le says, but even in China, its sales are starting to slip. Musk is currently pushing to win approval from Chinese regulators for Tesla’s “full self-driving” technology. The company is currently hampered by rules that prevent data from Chinese drivers from being taken out of the country, which Musk says has forced them to use publicly available videos of Chinese streets to train their vehicles.\n\nTesla last month rolled out a partial self-driving mode on its Chinese models, though it costs almost $9,000, while BYD is offering similar technology for free on its vehicles.\n\n“China is the linchpin to Tesla’s overall long-term strategy,” said Le.\n\nMusk’s China ties are deeper than Tesla\n\nMusk’s activities in China had attracted controversy even before he took on his new political role. In 2022, Tesla was blasted by human rights groups and lawmakers for opening a showroom in China’s Xinjiang region, where the government’s treatment of ethnic Uyghur Muslims had been described as a genocide by both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nThe critics included then-senator, now Secretary of State Marco Rubio, sponsor of that year’s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, who described the showroom on Twitter as an example of “Nationless corporations … helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide and slave labor.”\n\nMusk’s China ties have also raised security concerns, given that another of his companies, SpaceX, is a major US military contractor and Musk himself has “top secret” security clearance. In 2022, Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) pushed for closed-door intelligence briefings on Capitol Hill to determine whether SpaceX had any links to the Chinese government, telling the Wall Street Journal, “I am a fan of Elon Musk and SpaceX, but anyone would be concerned if there are financial entanglements with China.”\n\nSeveral companies with links to Musk’s businesses have also been targeted by the US government. In January, the Pentagon added Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL), the world’s largest producer of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, and a major Tesla supplier, to its list of “Chinese military companies” that produce both civilian and military goods. US firms are not prohibited from doing business with companies on this list, but the list is intended to raise reputational and compliance costs.\n\nAnother company on the list, the Chinese internet giant Tencent, at one point owned a 5 percent stake in Tesla, though according to media reports, it has since divested its holdings. Tencent is the parent company of WeChat, which was once often referred to as “China’s Twitter,” but has since become an all-encompassing app used for a wide variety of payments and communication. Musk has cited WeChat as a model for the “everything app” he would like to build X into.\n\nThe true extent of Musk’s links to Chinese companies may not be fully known. The Financial Times reported that Chinese investors have been funneling tens of millions of dollars into Musk’s non-public companies, like SpaceX, Neuralink, and xAI, using opaque ownership structures that shield investors’ identities.\n\nChina’s man on the inside?\n\nWhy does any of this matter? Musk’s influence may already be helping to shape US policy toward China. At the end of last year, he publicly opposed a bipartisan spending bill that included measures to regulate US investments in China. A stopgap bill was eventually passed without the provision, with Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) accusing House Republicans of caving because “Elon had a problem.”\n\nExperts say Chinese leaders are hoping to leverage their connections to the DOGE boss to influence the administration’s policies. Chinese Vice President Han Zheng met with Musk on the eve of Trump’s inauguration. TikTok CEO Shou Chew has also been in communication with Musk, viewing him as a conduit to the White House as the company tries to navigate concerns about its Chinese parent company ByteDance.\n\nIn February, the Financial Times reported that Chinese officials were considering using Tesla’s quest for approval for self-driving as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\n“They absolutely see him as an asset to them in any kind of negotiations, a way to bypass Rubio, a way to bypass [national security adviser Michael] Waltz, a way to bypass those whom they see to be less friendly to them on their issues, and they’re going to use him as a conduit,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), ranking member of the House Select Committee on the CCP, told Vox at a recent event in Washington. (The White House’s National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe committee’s chair, Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) didn’t criticize Musk directly but agreed that “they’re going to use every bit of leverage they can.”\n\nOn paper, a national security team that includes Rubio and Waltz reporting to Trump seems like a China hawk’s dream. And in some respects, such as Rubio’s push to keep Chinese economic interests out of the Panama Canal, it has been. Chinese officials are reportedly concerned that the Trump administration will use tariffs to pressure other developing countries to reduce their ties with Beijing.\n\nBut in many respects, the administration has been less hawkish than many expected. It’s true that Trump has slapped 20 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, ostensibly over China’s role in the global fentanyl trade, though these are less than the 60 percent tariffs he proposed on the campaign trail, or the 25 percent tariffs he has now slapped on Mexico and Canada. (Canada and European countries have earned Trump’s ire more than China, at least so far.)\n\nTrump also backed off a move to close a tax loophole used by Chinese fast fashion brands like Temu and Shein to ship to the United States, and despite having once called for the banning of TikTok, his administration appears to be in no hurry to enforce the ban on the app passed by Congress last year.\n\nTrump’s foreign aid cuts have dealt a blow to dozens of nonprofits monitoring corruption and human rights abuses in China, as well as Tibet’s government in exile. Statements by Trump and some of his senior officials, as well as the administration’s treatment of Ukraine, have cast doubt on whether the administration would intervene to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n\nMusk has said in the past that it would make sense for Taiwan to be a “special administrative zone” within China. In an interview in Taipei last fall, Taiwan’s deputy minister of digital affairs told Vox his government was seeking alternative satellite services to SpaceX because Musk “could cut the service [over] his personal opinion, so we don’t think this was a trustable partner.”\n\nMusk has spoken out against tariffs in the past, and Tesla has warned it could be exposed to retaliatory tariffs from other governments, but because Tesla has built relatively self-sufficient supply chains within both the US and China, the measures announced by Trump so far may hurt Musk’s competitors more than they hurt him.\n\nStill, if US-China trade relations deteriorate further, not to mention the sort of “decoupling” Rubio advocated as a senator, it’s hard to imagine Musk’s bottom line won’t be affected, or that he won’t have something to say about it.\n\n“I cannot imagine the Trump administration actually being fully hawkish on China, until Musk greatly recedes from the scene,” said Stone Fish.\n\nMusk’s views on China and Taiwan, his economic links to Beijing, and the fact that SpaceX has reportedly denied Starlink satellite service to Ukraine at various points in the war are likely to be reexamined again amid reports that Musk is being read in on Pentagon plans. The New York Times speculated that Musk’s briefing may be to ensure that whatever cuts Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency plans to make at the Pentagon don’t affect US readiness for a conflict in China, which has been one of the overriding priorities of US defense planning for years. According to the Wall Street Journal’s sources, Musk is receiving the briefing because he “asked for one.”\n\nThe administration’s China policy, on both the economic and national security fronts, is still somewhat of a work in progress, and the hawks may still have their way, as they often did during Trump’s first term. A test may come in June when, according to reports, a Trump-Xi summit is in the works, perhaps paving the way for formal trade talks.\n\nIf he’s not in the room, Chinese leaders are likely hoping Musk will at least be nearby.",

        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nThe AI world is moving so fast that it’s easy to get lost amid the flurry of shiny new products. OpenAI announces one, then the Chinese startup DeepSeek releases one, then OpenAI immediately puts out another one. Each is important, but focus too much on any one of them and you’ll miss the really big story of the past six months.\n\nThe big story is: AI companies now claim that their models are capable of genuine reasoning — the type of thinking you and I do when we want to solve a problem.\n\nAnd the big question is: Is that true?\n\nThe stakes are high, because the answer will inform how everyone from your mom to your government should — and should not — turn to AI for help.\n\nIf you’ve played around with ChatGPT, you know that it was designed to spit out quick answers to your questions. But state-of-the-art “reasoning models” — like OpenAI’s o1 or DeepSeek’s r1 — are designed to “think” a while before responding, by breaking down big problems into smaller problems and trying to solve them step by step. The industry calls that “chain-of-thought reasoning.”\n\nThese models are yielding some very impressive results. They can solve tricky logic puzzles, ace math tests, and write flawless code on the first try. Yet they also fail spectacularly on really easy problems.\n\nAI experts are torn over how to interpret this. Skeptics take it as evidence that “reasoning” models aren’t really reasoning at all. Believers insist that the models genuinely are doing some reasoning, and though it may not currently be as flexible as a human’s reasoning, it’s well on its way to getting there.\n\nSo, who’s right?\n\nThe best answer will be unsettling to both the hard skeptics of AI and the true believers.\n\nWhat counts as reasoning?\n\nLet’s take a step back. What exactly is reasoning, anyway?\n\nAI companies like OpenAI are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems, which they tackle step by step, ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain — nevermind in AI — they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning.\n\nThere’s deductive reasoning, where you start with a general statement and use it to reach a specific conclusion. There’s inductive reasoning, where you use specific observations to make a broader generalization. And there’s analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, common sense reasoning … suffice it to say, reasoning is not just one thing!\n\nNow, if someone comes up to you with a hard math problem and gives you a chance to break it down and think about it step by step, you’ll do a lot better than if you have to blurt out the answer off the top of your head. So, being able to do deliberative “chain-of-thought reasoning” is definitely helpful, and it might be a necessary ingredient of getting anything really difficult done. Yet it’s not the whole of reasoning.\n\nOne feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out “a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new, unseen situations,” writes Melanie Mitchell, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, together with her co-authors in a paper on AI’s reasoning abilities. “Even very young children are adept at learning abstract rules from just a few examples.”\n\nIn other words, a toddler can generalize. Can an AI?\n\nA lot of the debate turns around this question. Skeptics are very, well, skeptical of AI’s ability to generalize. They think something else is going on.\n\nThe skeptic’s case\n\n“It’s a kind of meta-mimicry,” Shannon Vallor, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, told me when OpenAI’s o1 came out in September.\n\nShe meant that while an older model like ChatGPT mimics the human-written statements in its training data, a newer model like o1 mimics the process that humans engage in to come up with those statements. In other words, she believes, it’s not truly reasoning. It would be pretty easy for o1 to just make it sound like it’s reasoning; after all, its training data is rife with examples of that, from doctors analyzing symptoms to decide on a diagnosis to judges evaluating evidence to arrive at a verdict.\n\nBesides, when OpenAI built the o1 model, it made some changes from the previous ChatGPT model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture — and ChatGPT was flubbing easy questions last year, like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way. So why, Vallor asked, would we think o1 is doing something totally new and magical — especially given that it, too, flubs easy questions? “In the cases where it fails, you see what, for me, is compelling evidence that it’s not reasoning at all,” she said.\n\nMitchell was surprised at how well o3 — OpenAI’s newest reasoning model, announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 — performed on tests. But she was also surprised at just how much computation it used to solve the problems. We don’t know what it’s doing with all that computation, because OpenAI is not transparent about what’s going on under the hood.\n\n“I’ve actually done my own experiments on people where they’re thinking out loud about these problems, and they don’t think out loud for, you know, hours of computation time,” she told me. “They just say a couple sentences and then say, ‘Yeah, I see how it works,’ because they’re using certain kinds of concepts. I don’t know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts.”\n\nWithout greater transparency from the company, Mitchell said we can’t be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach, as OpenAI claims.\n\nShe pointed to a paper, “Let’s Think Dot by Dot,” where researchers did not get a model to break down a problem into intermediate steps; instead, they just told the model to generate dots. Those dots were totally meaningless — what the paper’s authors call “filler tokens.” But it turned out that just having additional tokens there allowed the model more computational capacity, and it could use that extra computation to solve problems better. That suggests that when a model generates intermediate steps — whether it’s a phrase like “let’s think about this step by step” or just “....” — those steps don’t necessarily mean it’s doing the human-like reasoning you think it’s doing.\n\n“I think a lot of what it’s doing is more like a bag of heuristics than a reasoning model,” Mitchell told me. A heuristic is a mental shortcut — something that often lets you guess the right answer to a problem, but not by actually thinking it through.\n\nHere’s a classic example: Researchers trained an AI vision model to analyze photos for skin cancer. It seemed, at first blush, like the model was genuinely figuring out if a mole is malignant. But it turned out the photos of malignant moles in its training data often contained a ruler, so the model had just learned to use the presence of a ruler as a heuristic for deciding on malignancy.\n\nSkeptical AI researchers think that state-of-the-art models may be doing something similar: They appear to be “reasoning” their way through, say, a math problem, but really they’re just drawing on a mix of memorized information and heuristics.\n\nThe believer’s case\n\nOther experts are more bullish on reasoning models. Ryan Greenblatt, chief scientist at Redwood Research, a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced AI, thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning.\n\n“They do it in a way that doesn’t generalize as well as the way humans do it — they’re relying more on memorization and knowledge than humans do — but they’re still doing the thing,” Greenblatt said. “It’s not like there’s no generalization at all.”\n\nAfter all, these models have been able to solve hard problems beyond the examples they’ve been trained on — often very impressively. For Greenblatt, the simplest explanation as to how is that they are indeed doing some reasoning.\n\nAnd the point about heuristics can cut both ways, whether we’re talking about a reasoning model or an earlier model like ChatGPT. Consider the “a man, a boat, and a goat” prompt that had many skeptics mocking OpenAI last year:\n\nWhat’s going on here? Greenblatt says the model messed up because this prompt is actually a classic logic puzzle that dates back centuries and that would have appeared many times in the training data. In some formulations of the river-crossing puzzle, a farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross over by boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and a single item at a time — but if left together, the wolf will eat the goat or the goat will eat the cabbage, so the challenge is to get everything across without anything getting eaten. That explains the model’s mention of a cabbage in its response. The model would instantly “recognize” the puzzle.\n\n“My best guess is that the models have this incredibly strong urge to be like, ‘Oh, it’s this puzzle! I know what this puzzle is! I should do this because that performed really well in the training data.’ It’s like a learned heuristic,” Greenblatt said. The implication? “It’s not that it can’t solve it. In a lot of these cases, if you say it’s a trick question, and then you give the question, the model often does totally fine.”\n\nHumans fail in the same way all the time, he pointed out. If you’d just spent a month studying color theory — from complementary colors to the psychological effects of different hues to the historical significance of certain pigments in Renaissance paintings — and then got a quiz asking, “Why did the artist paint the sky blue in this landscape painting?”... well, you might be tricked into writing a needlessly complicated answer! Maybe you’d write about how the blue represents the divine heavens, or how the specific shade suggests the painting was done in the early morning hours which symbolizes rebirth … when really, the answer is simply: Because the sky is blue!\n\nAjeya Cotra, a senior analyst at Open Philanthropy who researches the risks from AI, agrees with Greenblatt on that point. And, she said of the latest models, “I think they’re genuinely getting better at this wide range of tasks that humans would call reasoning tasks.”\n\nShe doesn’t dispute that the models are doing some meta-mimicry. But when skeptics say “it’s just doing meta-mimicry,” she explained, “I think the ‘just’ part of it is the controversial part. It feels like what they’re trying to imply often is ‘and therefore it’s not going to have a big impact on the world’ or ‘and therefore artificial superintelligence is far away’ — and that’s what I dispute.”\n\nTo see why, she said, imagine you’re teaching a college physics class. You’ve got different types of students. One is an outright cheater: He just looks in the back of the book for the answers and then writes them down. Another student is such a savant that he doesn’t even need to think about the equations; he understands the physics on such a deep, intuitive, Einstein-like level that he can derive the right equations on the fly. All the other students are somewhere in the middle: They’ve memorized a list of 25 equations and are trying to figure out which equation to apply in which situation.\n\nLike the majority of students, AI models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning, Cotra told me.\n\n“The AI models are like a student that is not very bright but is superhumanly diligent, and so they haven’t just memorized 25 equations, they’ve memorized 500 equations, including ones for weird situations that could come up,” she said. They’re pairing a lot of memorization with a little bit of reasoning — that is, with figuring out what combination of equations to apply to a problem. “And that just takes you very far! They seem at first glance as impressive as the person with the deep intuitive understanding.”\n\nOf course, when you look harder, you can still find holes that their 500 equations just happen not to cover. But that doesn’t mean zero reasoning has taken place.\n\nIn other words, the models are neither exclusively reasoning nor exclusively just reciting.\n\n“It’s somewhere in between,” Cotra said. “I think people are thrown off by that because they want to put it in one camp or another. They want to say it’s just memorizing or they want to say it’s truly deeply reasoning. But the fact is, there’s just a spectrum of the depth of reasoning.”\n\nAI systems have “jagged intelligence”\n\nResearchers have come up with a buzzy term to describe this pattern of reasoning: “jagged intelligence.” It refers to the strange fact that, as computer scientist Andrej Karpathy explained, state-of-the-art AI models “can both perform extremely impressive tasks (e.g., solve complex math problems) while simultaneously struggling with some very dumb problems.”\n\nDrew Shannon for Vox\n\nPicture it like this. If human intelligence looks like a cloud with softly rounded edges, artificial intelligence is like a spiky cloud with giant peaks and valleys right next to each other. In humans, a lot of problem-solving capabilities are highly correlated with each other, but AI can be great at one thing and ridiculously bad at another thing that (to us) doesn’t seem far apart.\n\nMind you, it’s all relative.\n\n“Compared to what humans are good at, the models are quite jagged,” Greenblatt told me. “But I think indexing on humans is a little confusing. From the model’s perspective, it’s like, ‘Wow, those humans are so jagged! They’re so bad at next-token prediction!’ It’s not clear that there’s some objective sense in which AI is more jagged.”\n\nThe fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare AI intelligence to human intelligence. But the best way to think of AI is probably not as “smarter than a human” or “dumber than a human” but just as “different.”\n\nRegardless, Cotra anticipates that sooner or later AI intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence, and then some.\n\n“I think about, what are the risks that emerge when AI systems are truly better than human experts at everything? When they might still be jagged, but their full jagged intelligence encompasses all of human intelligence and more?” she said. “I’m always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that.”\n\nFor now, the practical upshot for most of us is this: Remember what AI is and isn’t smart at — and use it accordingly.\n\nThe best use case is a situation where it’s hard for you to come up with a solution, but once you get a solution from the AI you can easily check to see if it’s correct. Writing code is a perfect example. Another example would be making a website: You can see what the AI produced and, if you don’t like it, just get the AI to redo it.\n\nIn other domains — especially ones where there is no objective right answer or where the stakes are high — you’ll want to be more hesitant about using AI. You might get some initial suggestions from it, but don’t put too much stock in it, especially if what it’s saying seems off to you. An example would be asking for advice on how to handle a moral dilemma. You might see what thoughts the model is provoking in you without trusting it as giving you the final answer.\n\n“The more things are fuzzy and judgment-driven,” Cotra said, “the more you want to use it as a thought partner, not an oracle.”",

His coverage focuses on all things cinema, from the intricacies of film history to the nuts and bolts of filmmaking.\n\nIn 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he’s convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks … good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baillie told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on the movie. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how all this was pulled off, check out Vox Video’s latest!",

        "content": "When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market? There’s no simple answer, but there’s a rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run.\n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7 percent, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7 percent, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being that you’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time.\n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10 percent annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\n\n\nFind this and other Vox videos on YouTube.\n\n\n\nThis video is presented by Robinhood.

He worked at Time magazine for 15 years as a foreign correspondent in Asia, a climate writer, and an international editor, and he wrote a book on existential risk.\n\nThere’s a thought experiment that has taken on almost mythic status among a certain group of technologists: If you build an artificial intelligence and give it a seemingly innocuous goal, like making as many paper clips as possible, it might eventually turn everything — including humanity — into raw material for more paper clips.\n\nAbsurd parables like this one have been taken seriously by some of the loudest voices in Silicon Valley, many of whom are now warning that AI is an existential risk, more dangerous than nuclear weapons. These stories have shaped how billionaires including Elon Musk think about AI and fueled a growing movement of people who believe it could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to humanity.\n\nSo what exactly should we actually be worried about when it comes to AI?\n\nIn Good Robot, a special four-part podcast series launching March 12 from Unexplainable and Future Perfect, host Julia Longoria goes deep into the strange, high-stakes world of AI to answer that question. But this isn’t just a story about technology — it’s about the people shaping it, the competing ideologies driving them, and the enormous consequences of getting this right (or wrong).\n\nFor a long time, AI was something most people didn’t have to think about, but that’s no longer the case. The decisions being made right now — about who controls AI, how it’s trained, and what it should or shouldn’t be allowed to do — are already changing the world.\n\n\n\nThe people trying to build these systems don’t agree on what should happen next — or even on what exactly it is they’re creating. Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), while OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has talked of creating a “magic intelligence in the sky” — something like a god.\n\nBut whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we’re building is only beginning. Good Robot takes you inside this fight — not just the technology, but the ideologies, fears, and ambitions shaping it. From billionaires and researchers to ethicists and skeptics, this is the story of AI’s messy, uncertain future, and the people trying to steer it.\n\nGood Robot #1: The magic intelligence in the sky\n\nBefore AI became a mainstream obsession, one thinker sounded the alarm about its catastrophic potential.

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox, where he focuses on the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the decline of liberal democracy in the United States. He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nA Vox reader asks: If we have “separation of church and state,” why do we give religious schools tax exemption? How come religious schools get government funding? Why was Trump allowed to campaign on religion and publicly sell Bibles? Why does it say “In God We Trust” on our money? Why is “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance?\n\nThe concept of “separation of church and state” isn’t quite as ironclad as you may think.\n\nThe First Amendment prohibits laws “respecting an establishment of religion,” a provision that many Americans believe should create a firm wall of separation between church and state. But the Constitution also does not enforce itself. In the United States, we rely on judges and Supreme Court justices to determine what the Constitution means and to apply it to individual cases.\n\nThat means that the amount of church and state separation in the United States tends to ebb and flow depending on who sits on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe idea that the government should play no role in funding or encouraging religion probably hit its high water mark in the mid-20th century. As the Supreme Court said in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), “no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.” That suggests that it is unconstitutional to fund any religious activity with money collected from taxes.\n\nBeginning in the Nixon administration, however, the Court started to move steadily rightward. Nixon filled four of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, though most of his nominees were relative moderates compared to the increasingly ideological justices chosen by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump.\n\nToday, the Republican Party has a 6-3 supermajority on the Supreme Court, and when church and state cases have come before them, all six of those Republicans have behaved exactly how you would expect members of a political movement closely aligned with conservative Christianity to behave. That means that the Court is now actively tearing down whatever barrier used to exist between church and state.\n\nRelated The Supreme Court is leading a Christian conservative revolution\n\nWhy is religion in public schools and on American money?\n\nLet’s start with Carson v. Makin (2022), in which the Republican justices concluded that, if a state offers vouchers to help some students pay for private education, it must allow those vouchers to be spent on religious schools. The Court also recently announced that it will hear two other cases, out of Oklahoma, which are likely to require states to fund religious charter schools.\n\nRelated A new Supreme Court case would force the government to create religious public schools\n\nIf you’re looking for an explanation for this shift, you will not find it in the Constitution, as the text of the First Amendment has not changed. You will find it instead within the shifting personnel within the Supreme Court.\n\nThe question of whether taxpayers must fund religious schools is a hotly contested one and is likely to hinge on which political party controls the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future. But it’s worth acknowledging that there are people of faith in both political parties. Americans of all political persuasions care a great deal about their churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues.\n\nIndeed, that may explain why Trump — who, as a private citizen campaigning for office, had a First Amendment right to say anything he wanted to say about religion — chose to center religion in his campaign and even sell Bibles. The Bible is literally the most popular book in the world, and millions of American voters look fondly upon politicians who align themselves with it.\n\nAnd this reality also shapes how, say, US tax policy functions.\n\nThere’s never been a serious effort to strip religious charities, including houses of worship, of their tax-exempt status. And there probably never will be, because the people who attend those houses of worship are voters, and they would likely rise up in outrage if such a thing were attempted.\n\nThat said, the Constitution has also long been understood to forbid religious discrimination. So these tax exemptions must be offered equally to people of all faiths. If a church can claim a tax exemption, a mosque must also be able to claim that same exemption on the same terms.\n\nSimilarly, there are some largely ceremonial or symbolic nods to religion — such as the use of the phrase “In God we Trust” on US coins, or the opening of many legislative sessions with a prayer — that, as the Supreme Court said in Marsh v. Chambers (1983), are “deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country,” a history and tradition that — especially early on — was intertwined with Christianity. The courts have left many of these symbolic acknowledgments of religion in place, in part because attempting to dislodge them is unlikely to be successful.\n\nTo understand why, consider a controversy that briefly flared up during the second Bush administration. In 2002, a federal appeals court ruled that the inclusion of the words “under God” in a public school’s daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance violates the Constitution. That decision triggered a massive backlash among members of Congress, including a bipartisan proposal to amend the Constitution to permit “a reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance or on United States currency.”",

        "content": "is an environmental correspondent at Vox, covering biodiversity loss and climate change. Before joining Vox, he was a senior energy reporter at Business Insider. Benji previously worked as a wildlife researcher.\n\nIn the 1970s, acid rain was one of the most serious environmental threats in North America and Europe. The air was so laden with pollution from coal power plants and cars at the time that it turned the rain toxic. Downpours killed fish, destroyed forests, eroded statues, and damaged buildings, sparking public outcry.\n\n“Acid rain is a particularly alarming demonstration of the simple adage that what goes up must come down,” former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart said in 1979. “With acid rain,” he said, “what comes down is much worse than what went up — worse in its potential damage to trees and crops, worse in its potential damage to freshwater lakes and fish and tourism.”\n\nA few decades later, acid rain had largely disappeared.\n\nA statue on the side of a building that’s been weathered, in part, by acid rain, seen in Leipzig, Germany in 1990. Richard Baker/In Pictures via Getty Images A forest in Poland that’s been killed off by acid rain. Christopher Pillitz/Getty Images\n\nBeginning around 1990, the US and Europe passed legislation that limited the amount of acid-forming pollutants — such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides — that power plants could emit. Laws requiring car manufacturers to put catalytic converters into new vehicles, which reduced harmful emissions, were also taking effect. That brings us to today: While precipitation in some regions is still unnaturally acidic, on the whole, acid rain is largely a problem of the past and a major environmental success story.\n\nNow, however, there’s another problem with our rain — and it’s even more alarming.\n\nWhile precipitation has become less acidic, a growing body of evidence suggests that it’s now full of many other pollutants that pose a risk to public health, including microplastics. And unlike the compounds that cause acid rain, these pollutants are almost impossible to get rid of.\n\nThe new pollutants in our rain\n\nAs government regulators focused on reigning in air pollution, companies were busy generating new sources of pollution, including plastics and PFAS, the so-called forever chemicals. PFAS, which stands for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a large group of compounds used, among other things, to make fabric stain-resistant and pans nonstick.\n\nOver time, these modern-era substances — which famously take decades to millennia to degrade — have leached into the environment, reaching every corner of the planet, no matter how tall or deep. Microplastics, PFAS, and some other compounds, such as pesticides, are now so widespread that they’ve essentially become part of our biome, not unlike bacteria or fungi.\n\nThey’re so common, in fact, that they’re even found in the rain.\n\nA number of studies, for example, have documented microplastics in rain falling all over the world — even in remote, unpopulated regions. For one 2020 analysis in the journal Science, researchers documented microplastics in rainwater that fell on several national parks and wilderness areas in the Western US. Most of the plastic bits were microfibers, such as those shed from polyester sweaters or carpeting on the floor of a car. The researchers estimated that more than 1,000 metric tons of plastic from the atmosphere fall on parks in the West each year, including both as rainfall and as dry dust. That’s equivalent to roughly 120 to 300 million plastic water bottles, according to the study.\n\nThe largest source of those microplastics was highways, said Janice Brahney, a biogeochemist at Utah State University who led the Science study. Roads are often littered with plastic waste that gets broken down by cars and kicked up into the air. Those particles are typically lighter than soil, so once they become airborne, they can easily move around in the atmosphere and get grabbed by rain as it falls.\n\nA gull carrying a piece of trash along the San Gabriel River in Southern California. Mark Rightmire/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images\n\nAnother important source of plastic rain is the ocean, Brahney said. Several million tons of plastic enter the ocean each year, much of which breaks down into microplastics. When waves crash on the beach or bubbles burst on the sea surface, it sends microscopic plastic particles into the air.\n\nPlastic rain is an environmental threat that’s harder to fix than the last one. “It’s much worse than the acid rain problem,” Brahney said. “With acid rain, we could stop emitting acid precursors and then acid rain would stop falling. But we can’t stop the microplastic cycle anymore. It’s there and it’s not going away.”\n\nThe story of PFAS is similarly bleak: Researchers have detected these chemicals in rain across the planet from the US and Sweden to China and even Antarctica, often at levels above drinking water guidelines. For a study published in 2024 — titled “It’s raining PFAS in South Florida” — researchers analyzed rainwater that fell around Miami and found more than 20 PFAS compounds, including PFOS and PFOA. Although these two PFAS were phased out in the US years ago due to public health concerns, the researchers still found them at concentrations beyond government health advisory levels for drinking water, underscoring the remarkable persistence of forever chemicals.\n\nFor another article, published in 2022, scientists reviewed studies of PFAS in rainwater and similarly found concentrations of these chemicals at levels above what US and Danish regulators say is safe for drinking water. The authors concluded that, based on health advisories, no untreated rainwater would be considered safe to drink.\n\n“For us to get rid of PFAS, we probably have to go back in time,” said Natalia Soares Quinete, a chemist at Florida International University who was involved in the 2024 study. Even though the government is increasingly regulating PFAS, she said, “I don’t see us completely getting rid of those chemicals.”\n\nIs the rain dangerous?\n\nThe good news is that most people — especially in wealthy countries like the US — don’t rely on untreated rainwater. What is concerning is that rain ends up in groundwater, rivers, and reservoirs that feed into municipal water systems.\n\nTreatment plants help a lot, typically removing upward of 70 percent of microplastics in water, but some still pass through. A study published earlier this year, for example, found a small amount of microplastics in bottled water and tap water in France. Similarly, typical filtration plants for municipal water remove some but not all PFAS. Authors of a 2023 study by the US Geological Survey, a federal agency, estimate that at least 45 percent of the country’s tap water has at least one type of PFAS present.\n\nTreatment facilities don’t have the technology to treat all of the microplastic compounds, let alone the technology to measure them, Brahney said. “There are tens of thousands of chemicals involved, and we only understand a fraction of them,” she said.\n\nWhether or not you’re at risk from microplastics, PFAS, and other chemicals is all about exposure — how much of those substances you’re breathing in or consuming. There’s not much of them in a single glass of tap or a bottle of water. The problem is that there are many other pathways that these pollutants can take to enter your body, such as through food. And over time they add up.\n\nHow to protect yourself from polluted rain Avoid drinking untreated rainwater and eating snow, no matter how pristine it looks! If you can afford to filter your water, you should. Standard filters like reverse osmosis — which runs water through a semi-permeable membrane — typically remove a large portion of microplastics and PFAS. Some countertop pitcher filters also remove at least some PFAS (e.g., Zero Water) and microplastics (e.g., LifeStraw), though they vary a lot. Consumer Reports also has a great guide to getting PFAS out of your water. Opt for tap over bottled water to avoid ingesting microplastics. Tap water is also way better for the planet.\n\nA recent study found that the human brains contain as much as a typical plastic spoon’s worth of microplastic, by weight. Scientists still don’t understand what impact that might have on human health, but they suspect that microplastics could be linked to cancer, heart and kidney disease, and Alzheimer’s.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly all Americans have a measurable amount of PFAS in their blood, according to US health officials, though concentrations of some of them — including PFOA and PFOS — are declining. On the whole, forever chemicals are associated with a range of ailments including increased cholesterol, decreases in birth weight, and kidney cancer.\n\nAll of these contaminants can also be harmful to wildlife, which unlike most of us, do rely on untreated water. One study, for example, linked exposure to PFAS to impaired immune systems in alligators. “If we have these contaminants in our rainwater they’re getting into our groundwater,” Brahney said. “They’re infiltrating our soils. Every organism is interacting with rainwater.”\n\nUltimately, what all of this research reveals is that the planet is dirty, even if the filth can be hard to see. These chemicals are in the rain because they’re abundant in the environment — and they’re in the environment because they’re in the rain. And while there’s ongoing research, we don’t yet fully understand how those pollutants impact our bodies and our ecosystems. We just know they’ll be around for a very, very long time.",

        "content": "Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump took a set of thick, black permanent markers and signed a sweeping set of executive orders that took aim at everything from immigration and gender to TikTok and climate change. One of his first moves was to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations’ global health agency responsible for safeguarding and promoting health around the world since 1948.\n\nThe US is one of the WHO’s biggest funders, so any shortage of financial and political support will likely have major ramifications for global health efforts like eliminating malaria, improving access to high-quality health care, and reducing maternal mortality. While that may not directly matter to rich countries like the US that have the means to address their own health challenges, one of the WHO’s most important jobs is to help coordinate the international response to pandemics and outbreaks — events that can threaten everyone, regardless of borders, as we learned during Covid-19.\n\nTo Trump and his supporters, the WHO’s perceived failure on that job is one of the biggest reasons why the US should withdraw. Chief among Trump’s complaints are the WHO’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global health crises, its failure to reform, and its inability to demonstrate independence from powerful but authoritarian WHO member states, namely China.\n\nTrump’s decision has engendered plenty of criticism, including from experts who argue that the US could suffer if it loses access to vital WHO data on outbreaks. Still, the WHO is far from perfect, and even before Trump, scientists, think tanks, and government bodies have been pointing out the WHO’s myriad problems, from the lack of term limits for senior leadership to its massive budget for headquarters staff who are paid additional stipends (around $5,000 to $7,000 per month) to cover the cost of living in Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI’ve seen the inefficiencies and mismanagement first hand: In my almost 10-year career as a global health epidemiologist, I have interacted with the WHO on many occasions, including, at times, coordinating with them to respond to disease outbreaks in Africa. Like Trump, my biggest complaint is that the organization has shown it is loath to reflect on and address its deficiencies — deficiencies that matter hugely when it has been given the monumental responsibility of safeguarding the world’s health. There has always been some intangible and unspoken sense that the WHO cannot be wrong and cannot be questioned, even after it was clear that it bungled certain aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut while the WHO is far from perfect, many of its flaws are symptoms of more fundamental challenges that go beyond how it is governed. Balancing the need to respond to international health threats while respecting national sovereignty means cooperation is a fine line — and it’s one that’s becoming harder for the agency to walk.\n\nFor the WHO to survive, it needs to improve. And for the US to have the best chances of protecting itself from future global health emergencies — especially as the Trump administration also works to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, another key player in global health and development — it still needs the WHO. But it needs a better one.\n\nWhat Trump gets right — and wrong — about WHO\n\nIn his executive order, Trump reiterated many of the same issues he raised five years ago when he first threatened to withdraw from the WHO.\n\nOne of Trump’s biggest complaints was that the agency was too slow to alert the world of an emerging health threat in China and to move to contain its spread. Local newspapers had been reporting that a mysterious illness was spreading around Wuhan as early as November 17, 2019, a fact backed up by genetic analysis.\n\nBut Chinese health authorities didn’t alert the WHO — which the country was required to do under a legal framework called the International Health Regulations — to a spate of patients with an unknown pneumonia-like disease until December 31. By then, valuable time to contain the disease had been lost, though it is Beijing, not WHO, that is largely at fault for this lag.\n\nStill, while the WHO has limited if any power to compel China or any other country to act, the body should have been more proactive in November and December.\n\n“WHO has country offices, WHO has relationships with Ministries of Health. I would argue they certainly should have been aware this was happening,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator during the Biden administration. “It was showing up in a lot of media, social media, and they should have pushed the government to say, what is this? What is going on here, and why don’t we know more about it?”\n\nWithin five days of learning about the unusual cases in China, the WHO had alerted its member states. But the WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to China and, instead of confronting the government about its obfuscation, heralded Beijing’s response to the outbreak. And then the WHO consistently parrotted inaccurate information from the Chinese government — namely that the virus was not spreading from person to person — to the rest of the world for weeks.\n\nWhile the WHO proclaimed Covid-19 a public health emergency in late January, the messaging from the highest levels of WHO in those early months, when officials believed it was still possible that Covid could be contained, was too often confusing.\n\n“For the moment, we are not witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in late February. That was simply untrue. By that time, China had reported almost 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, while 37 other countries were also reporting cases and deaths.\n\nIt also took the WHO two years, until late 2021, to finally acknowledge that Covid-19 was airborne, despite the mountain of evidence that scientists had amassed just six months after the first cases. A WHO spokesperson pushed back against this. “From January 2020, WHO said transmission was occurring between people when they breathe, talk (later sing) and especially in settings like hospitals, households and long term living facilities,” a spokesperson told Vox by email. While some of this confusion stemmed from longstanding disagreement on what exactly constitutes airborne spread, as late as March 2020 the WHO was still confidently tweeting, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” even as people were being infected through the air.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a daily press briefing on Covid-19 on March 11, 2020. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump has also repeatedly criticized the WHO for not fully investigating the theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from virological work in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than the conventional explanation that it began in wild animals sold at a meat market. The WHO sent a team of investigators to China in 2021, but Chinese scientists refused to discuss the so-called “lab leak” theory and then pressured investigators to dismiss the possibility altogether, according to the lead scientist on the team.\n\nAgain, though, the WHO has no authority to compel member states to turn over data or to cooperate on investigations. In fact, the WHO cannot even work inside a member state without that country’s permission. This is certainly a limitation of the WHO, but that’s because it answers to its member states — it is not some sort of supra-national health policy enforcement body.\n\nBeyond Covid, Trump has also griped that the WHO requires the US to make “unfairly onerous” payments, because US dues exceed the payment the organization demands of China, which has about four times the number of people as in the US.\n\nThe WHO is funded in two ways. The first is through assessed contributions, essentially membership dues, that each WHO member state is required to pay each year. The United Nations has a process for determining how much each country owes, but it’s essentially based on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), not its population size.\n\nUS GDP in 2023 was about 1.5 times higher than China’s. That year, the US was required to pay the WHO $218 million, about two times more than China was assessed. So while the US does pay more than China, that difference is almost, though not quite, proportional to GDP.\n\nAssessed contributions, however, make up less than 20 percent of the WHO’s total funds. Its other funding comes from voluntary contributions from member states and non-governmental donors, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHere is where the US and China make vastly different contributions to the WHO. In 2023, China gave the organization about $40 million in voluntary contributions plus an additional $935,000 toward an emergency fund on top of its assessed contribution, while the US government donated more than $1 billion in voluntary funds and about $47 million toward the emergency fund. In all, that meant the US gave the WHO about $1.27 billion in 2023, about 18 percent of their total budget, while China gave about $156 million when you tally up all contributions. So while the US does give vastly more to the WHO than China, most of that is in voluntary donations.\n\nOf course, the US doesn’t have to pull out of the WHO altogether to rectify this situation — it could simply choose to donate less to the WHO, or mandate that its contributions come with reform. And the institution does need reform.\n\nWho’s at fault at WHO, explained\n\nCovid wasn’t the first time the WHO came under international fire. Take the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nThe organization was criticized back in 2014 for its long delay in declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, which hindered swift containment measures that could have prevented the virus from spreading across borders. From the start, the WHO fundamentally underestimated the severity of the outbreak — Ebola would go on to kill more than 11,000 people primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with scattered cases reported in the US and several European countries, too. It ultimately took the WHO and its partners two years to get the Ebola outbreak under control.\n\nDespite the number of deaths, Ebola’s spread was limited largely because it isn’t a respiratory disease like Covid-19; rather it spreads through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. But that fact makes the failure to contain Ebola all the more glaring.\n\nTo be fair, all outbreak and pandemic responses are chaotic, especially when an entirely novel virus like Covid starts spreading. New information is constantly emerging, and a lot of different individuals and institutions have to come together to coordinate the flow of information and the rollout of interventions or recommendations, even as the full picture of the outbreak is inevitably unclear. Outbreaks often happen in far-flung areas that lack health care workers, hospitals, laboratories, and even roads and internet. Cultural practices, economic conditions, and a preexisting lack of trust in politicians and health officials further complicate responses.\n\nA health worker waits to handle a new unconfirmed Ebola patient at a newly built Doctors Without Borders-supported Ebola treatment center on November 7, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for delaying the dissemination of vaccines to help curb an ongoing mpox outbreak which began in May 2022 and spread to more than 120 countries before the virus became largely confined to central and eastern Africa.\n\nIn mid-2022, the US and EU approved an mpox vaccine made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic. But the WHO, which has its own process for reviewing and approving drugs and vaccines, did not approve the vaccine until September 2024.\n\nThat delay mattered. For one, other organizations like UNICEF and Gavi that play a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines in developing countries require WHO approval before they can move forward with vaccination campaigns. Many developing countries do not have or have only pared-down versions of drug regulatory agencies so they also rely on the WHO to approve medicines before they roll them out in their countries, explained Rogério Gaspar, the director of WHO’s Department of Regulation and Prequalification. And so when it came to the mpox vaccine, many countries — especially in Africa, where the outbreak was most severe — were waiting for the green light from WHO before they could roll out the needed vaccines, even though the US and Europe had already approved them.\n\nThe WHO blames the long delay on Bavarian Nordic. The WHO claimed that the company did not submit the mpox vaccine for review until August 2024, some two years after the mpox outbreak had begun, and that once it did, the WHO approved it within two weeks, according to a WHO spokesperson.\n\nBut Bavarian Nordic refutes this timeline. A spokesperson told Vox that the pharmaceutical company first met with WHO in August 2022 and submitted a dossier on the vaccine in May 2023. The dossier they submitted to the WHO contained the same information that led to the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the FDA, approving the vaccine for use in Europe. It isn’t clear why the WHO didn’t act sooner. Back in August 2024, the WHO director of health product policy and standards, Deusdedit Mubangizi, told reporters that there wasn’t enough data to support its approval. But now, it seems, the WHO has changed its story, ducking accountability once again.\n\nThe entire process has frustrated some public health experts. “It’s almost like WHO saying, hey, we’re not responsible for our own process,” Jha said. “This is the lack of accountability. It’s everybody else’s fault.”\n\n(A WHO spokesperson pointed out that member states did not have to wait until the WHO’s review was complete to buy and distribute the vaccines.)\n\nOver the years, the WHO has tried to address its critics through a laundry list of reform efforts — and there has been some improvement. Between 2020 and 2022, smaller Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Guinea have been contained in just a few months. That’s a hopeful signal the organization has potentially improved not only its own ability to quickly respond to outbreaks, but has also helped build member states’ capacity to detect and contain health emergencies. It also helps that since 2014, scientists have also developed a number of vaccines and treatments that would certainly help quell an outbreak.\n\nStill, while there were improvements in the Ebola response that can be attributable to the WHO, the organization’s dismal performance during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that these reforms remain insufficient. And the bigger issue is that the WHO simply cannot admit its mistakes. The organization has still not come out and listed the errors it made during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the WHO convened an independent panel of experts to review the international response to Covid-19, the panel’s reports largely focus on the failures of WHO member states and say little about the WHO’s own shortcomings.\n\n“There is very little interest at WHO in introspection,” Jha said. “There’s very little interest in WHO in figuring out how to do better.”\n\nAnd given how enormous — and how difficult — the WHO’s responsibilities are, that introspection is needed.\n\nThe WHO’s impossible task\n\nThe WHO’s mission is to foster global public health, but what that means in practice depends on what counts as global. As it stands, its 194 member states (193 without the US) have tasked the organization with outbreak prevention and response and other responsibilities that impact nearly all countries. That includes setting international health standards and collecting data on an ever-increasing list of health priorities ranging from maternal and child health and nutrition to sanitation and clean water. But some of the WHO’s work focuses on supplementing national health programs and filling gaps that benefit individual nations — specifically those with the least resources — rather than the world as a whole.\n\nThose responsibilities fit poorly with a Trump administration that is bringing an America First approach to health — and other countries are taking notice. Argentina has announced that it also plans to withdraw from the WHO, while Italian politicians have introduced legislation that would do the same. Other European countries have slashed global health aid budgets in recent years.\n\nThat the US cannot remain a WHO member while also consciously putting itself first highlights a friction in the field. Is global health about containing dangerous outbreaks so they don’t breach your own border and pose a threat to national security? Or is global health about saving lives and improving the health of everyone, regardless of their nationality? Can competing nation-states like China and the US set aside their political warfare and come together on one issue — health — or has the time for international cooperation finally ended?\n\nOne way to address that contradiction would be for the WHO to scale back on the number of health areas it is involved in and focus primarily on issues that actually transcend borders. This would include infectious diseases — but only those that present a truly global threat.\n\nThe WHO itself puts together a list of pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic. It includes familiar diseases such as West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and Covid-19. Many of these have already caused deadly outbreaks and pandemics. Something else that transcends borders: products such as cigarettes or baby formula. The WHO might also have a role to play in regulating the safety of these products, according to Jesse Bump, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThis recommendation is not to say that newborn and maternal health or access to clean water are not important, life-saving services that everyone on Earth should have. But these represent more national health priorities for the countries dealing with these issues and not truly global threats.\n\nWithout some form of additional support, paring down the WHO’s focus areas would have fatal consequences for some places. Particularly in low-income countries, the WHO serves as a lifeline of essential health services and often fills many of the responsibilities that national health agencies in wealthy nations like the US handle, a WHO spokesperson explained.\n\nOf course, the fact that the WHO is tasked with addressing so many different areas of health fundamentally reflects both the massive health disparities around the world and the way the organization is funded. Consider the health challenges that a country like the US faces compared to many developing countries. In places like Niger, Papua New Guinea, Chad, and the DRC, more than half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water or basic water services. More than 50 percent of people in Somalia and Haiti are malnourished. In southern Africa, HIV is still a leading cause of death; in parts of West Africa, malaria is a leading cause of death.\n\nIn much of the global north, by contrast, these health challenges are virtually nonexistent, and where they are present, it’s because of national priorities, not a lack of national resources.\n\nConsider as well the drastic difference in the health workforce around the world. In many low- and middle-income counties, there are major shortages of doctors and nurses, not to mention specialists such as neurologists or surgeons. In more than 50 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, there are fewer than one doctor per 1,000 people in the entire country. The US has almost four times as many doctors per capita.\n\nWhat this means is that the state of health and health care is so grossly unequal across countries that one organization cannot possibly address them all while also ensuring that every member states benefits equally from their WHO membership.\n\nAnd the benefits are unequal, at least in strict financial terms. Last year, countries in Africa and the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region — which includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East including some very poor and conflict-afflicted member states such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan — received $2.9 billion, almost half of the WHO’s $6.8 billion budget. The region of the Americas, which includes the US, received the least amount of funding, just over $300 million. But even here, it’s important to understand that the inequality in who gives and who gets from the WHO is largely a function of the fact that some regions and countries simply have a massively greater need for international aid.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the WHO has limited control over its own agenda. It is member states themselves who vote on the organization’s scope of work and approve its budget. Beyond the required payments, countries and other donors can earmark their voluntary funds for specific causes. The US, for instance, earmarks more than half of its funds for epidemic prevention or response and polio eradication while Nordic countries typically focus their funding on maternal health.\n\nThis approach to funding helps the WHO account for individual member state priorities but also allows countries to use funds to influence the WHO’s scope of work. Ultimately, it means that the WHO has little choice but to expand and scatter its workforce to make sure every country’s pet projects get completed.\n\nIs there any room for WHO in America First?\n\nShort of remaking the WHO into an institution under the leadership of the US government, it’s difficult to imagine that any amount of reform will satisfy the current administration. The organization’s mission is completely misaligned with Trump’s “America First” agenda. In the WHO, as in most other UN international bodies, America does not come first. It has the same vote as every other member state, even though the US contributes more money than any other country.\n\nBut despite its many shortcomings, the US needs the WHO. Only an international health agency such as the WHO can overcome the nuanced complexities of economic competition, geopolitics, and even outright war, to respond to global health emergencies. The WHO serves as a bridge for sharing information and even biological samples of pathogens, which is critical for understanding how a disease will spread and for developing medicines and vaccines.\n\nTrump’s vision of global health or public health, for that matter, is unclear. Just as unclear is whether Trump’s executive order on the WHO is even legal. Members of Congress have asked Trump to reconsider. Though the full impact of the US withdrawal will probably not be felt for about a year, the WHO’s director-general has already ordered a hiring freeze, mandated that some contracts be renegotiated, and directed staff in country offices to provide only essential support.\n\nAs the WHO adapts to a future without US investment, the Trump administration is also gutting other key global health efforts. This month, thousands of USAID staff were laid off, leaving only about 300 employees of a once 10,000-person workforce. It isn’t yet clear what global health areas the drastically smaller agency will work on — or whether it will exist at all — and it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration goes after other global health initiatives like the ones led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmerican retreat from both the WHO and its own broader global health efforts paradoxically makes the case for WHO reform all the more important. Many complaints about how the WHO does its work are valid, especially given its reluctance to confront mistakes. But much of what it is criticized for is built into the way the institution itself operates or reflects a world with hugely varying health problems and national abilities to meet them. Still, the WHO must do better because it is the only organization uniquely placed to bridge diplomatic tensions and address international health threats. The most hopeful read on Trump’s action will shock the bureaucracy into action, and lead the Trump administration to ultimately realize that an American-first approach must include the WHO.",

        "content": "is a staff writer for The Atlantic and the author of Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change .\n\nIf I ever need a reminder that I’m not a natural extrovert, I need only to look at the journal I kept during the early days of my improv classes. “I am having incredible dread about improv tomorrow,” I wrote one day. “I would literally pay any amount to get out of this class,” I moaned on another. “You can’t be bad at improv, but I feel like I am bad at improv,” I wrote after a class during which I gave up in the middle of a game called Big Booty and said simply, “I can’t take this anymore.”\n\nI had enrolled in improv because I was trying to become more extroverted, as part of a sweeping personality-change project that I document in my new book, Me, But Better. Extroversion is one of the “big five” personality traits that scientists say make up a person’s disposition, along with openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Extroversion is associated with socializing and cheerfulness, and as a hardened introvert, I knew I needed a mechanism to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. Improv seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.\n\nThese perks of extroversion would only reveal themselves to me in time, after many, many hours of playing Zip Zap Zop against my will.\n\nBut it wasn’t going well, and at times, I thought about dropping the class or giving up altogether. Even after I got better at improv, I still felt nervous before every class. And the other activities I was doing to boost my extroversion — like going on long hikes with strangers — were only mildly pleasant, at best. I had this notion that, since I was an introvert, I should avoid difficult social situations like, well, improv class.\n\nI’m glad I didn’t give up, though. It turns out that behaving in an extroverted way can have surprising benefits, even if you’re an introvert. And these perks of extroversion would only reveal themselves to me in time, after many, many hours of playing Zip Zap Zop against my will.\n\nWhat spurts of extroversion can do for introverts\n\nCompared to introverts, extroverts are happier, research unfortunately shows. An exhaustingly chirpy series of studies has found that social connection is one of the strongest predictors of well-being, and extroverts are more socially connected. In lab experiments, extroverts tend to interpret ambiguous stimuli more positively, hearing the word “won” rather than “one,” for example, or writing more uplifting short stories based on generic prompts. People who are extroverted as teenagers remain happier even when they’re 60.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI understand that introverts might not be thrilled to hear this — I wasn’t, either. But Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychologist who has studied this phenomenon, says it’s worth focusing less on the “extrovert” part of this and more on the fact that these individuals are more enmeshed in community. “Connection is really the key to happiness,” Lyubomirsky told me. And there are ways to square your natural introversion with the universal human need for connection. You don’t have to mingle with everyone at the office party, for instance. You can just call a trusted friend for a one-on-one conversation. Even hanging out with others and listening more than you talk can be a form of “extroversion,” Lyubomirsky says.\n\nOne surprising thing Introverts may believe that behaving like extroverts means going against their nature — but this doesn’t bother us as much as we might think. In one study, introverts even reported feeling truer to themselves when they were behaving like extroverts.\n\nWhile it’s true that extroverts enjoy talking, people, and attention, they also enjoy activity, period. Therefore, to boost your own levels of extroversion, you can just sign up for an activity — in addition to improv, I tried sailing — and commit to going, even if you don’t plan to talk much.\n\nThough there’s nothing wrong with being an introvert, several studies have shown that when introverts occasionally behave in extroverted ways, they experience more “positive affect” — science-speak for good feelings. “I started doing these studies because I didn’t believe them,” says John Zelenski, a psychology professor at Carleton University who has replicated this finding, and who himself is introverted. But “it absolutely seems correct that if you get people to act extroverted — and usually, that means socializing for a few minutes — there’s a big mood boost there.”\n\nThe reason for this twist is that behaving against our natures doesn’t bother us as much as we fear it might. In one study, introverts even reported feeling truer to themselves when they were behaving like extroverts. That’s because, much as we might prize authenticity, we have other desires, too. We want to handle difficult situations appropriately, feel embraced by others, and accomplish our goals — and most of us also want to feel happier and more connected. Sometimes, achieving those things means going against our “natural” personality traits.\n\n“Lots of things that we may not initially like doing actually really benefit us,” says Lyubomirsky, who, as an example, offered that she now loves running but took a while to get into it. “A lot of things in life don’t feel natural at first. … Just because it doesn’t feel comfortable and natural doesn’t mean it’s not authentic.” Authenticity can come from familiarity, and the only way to build familiarity is through experience.\n\nA desire to remain “authentic” is one reason people may balk at the idea of changing themselves — either through personality change or otherwise. But living authentically can also mean acting in ways that feel, at first, uncomfortable, as long as those actions draw you closer to your values and goals. Many of us, if we followed the North Star of “authenticity,” would quit our jobs, neglect our families, and watch Love Is Blind all day. But what is instinctive is not always best.\n\nThis doesn’t mean behaving like an extrovert constantly, just occasionally. I told Zelenski about a time I had to collect “man on the street” interviews as a reporter — a horrible task that involves approaching random strangers and lobbing questions at them in an attempt to find a pattern of responses for your story. One freezing cold night in New Jersey, I didn’t conceal my misery well enough. As I mangled my words and rubbed my hands together, one woman looked at me with pity and said, “Don’t worry, you’re almost done.”\n\n“After a while, it does get old,” Zelenski acknowledged.\n\nHow to coax out your inner extrovert\n\nTo figure out how to get better at these forays into extroversion, I called up Gillian Sandstrom, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Sussex in the UK. More importantly for my purposes, she talks to strangers — on the street, on vacation, even in the sacred space of the London Tube. She researches the power of “weak ties,” casual acquaintances with whom we interact, but usually only briefly. People who have lots of weak ties, who make eye contact and idle chitchat with baristas and neighbors, feel happier than those who don’t, her studies find.\n\nInitially, her research felt alien to me. I had stopped working in an office when the pandemic started, and I didn’t miss it at all. I live in the suburbs, so I don’t interact with many people unless I make a point to — and I usually don’t.\n\nSandstrom told me she’s the same way: She’s an introvert and tends to avoid demanding social situations. But she uses talking to strangers as a coping mechanism of sorts. If she’s in a big, crowded room, she finds someone who’s off by themselves and starts a one-on-one conversation.\n\nOne way to open such a conversation is by making a statement, rather than asking a question. For instance, when Sandstrom is on public transportation, she’ll test the waters by complimenting the person sitting next to her. (She recommends remarking on something other than their looks.) Or, she’ll comment on something in the environment — if they have a suitcase, she’ll ask where they’re going. One time, she was walking in a park and noticed a man smiling at some ducks. “Aren’t they cute?” Sandstrom said. She and the man ended up chatting for half an hour, since they were walking in the same direction. At the end of her conversations, Sandstrom just says something like, “Thank you, it’s been nice talking to you,” and walks off.\n\nJust like a mediocre movie wouldn’t make you swear off cinema forever, one bad conversation shouldn’t keep you from trying again.\n\nI told Sandstrom that I don’t miss my weak ties much, and I’m not really one for small talk. We either have to get to the bottom of your childhood trauma, or we’re not talking at all. The thing is, she pointed out, most weak ties probably aren’t going to become long-term relationships. I needed to set the stakes way lower. Her conversations tend to last just a few minutes, and sometimes, they’re nothing special. But just like a mediocre movie wouldn’t make you swear off cinema forever, one bad conversation shouldn’t keep you from trying again.\n\nOver time, these weak ties do benefit us, even if we don’t especially notice them. They make us feel woven into the social fabric, Sandstrom says, like we’re part of something bigger. “When I do talk to people, I feel better,” she told me. “It’s almost always at least an average experience.” And when a conversation is unusually engaging, “it feels awesome, because I wouldn’t expect there to be anything coming from it.”\n\nAs I sped home from my first improv class, I detected something that, honestly, floored me. I was smiling. Even though I would continue to dread it for months, something about the whole exercise was just so fun. I’m rarely immersed in something that’s meant to be light and exuberant, as opposed to correct or exacting. Because it was the middle of the pandemic, it had been months since I’d socialized with a group of people. The electricity of improv had invigorated me, in spite of myself.",

He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like The Atlantic, Gizmodo, and Vice.\n\nLast summer, I quit Spotify, and wrote about it with the rather unsubtle headline “Why I quit Spotify.” My reasons remain sound: The software had become clunky, the ads relentless, and the Sabrina Carpenter songs too inescapable. I wanted to find a better music streaming service. It gives me no pleasure to report that a few weeks ago, I rejoined.\n\nThe algorithm got me. I don’t just mean that it got me, the way the TikTok algorithm glues you to the screen. Spotify’s algorithm got me the way an old friend gets me and my weird affection for yacht rock or ongoing obsession with French touch music from the mid-Aughts. It took a few months of digging through the proverbial crates of Apple Music for me to realize that Spotify has something other streaming services could never get: 15 years of my music listening habits and artificially intelligent software to reinforce those habits.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nSpotify’s algorithm got me the way an old friend gets me and my weird affection for yacht rock.\n\nQuitting and unquitting Spotify made me realize something, though. As central as algorithmic feeds are to how you consume information, you have more control over how those algorithms shape your tastes and behavior than you might think.\n\nIf an algorithm works for you — as Spotify’s does for me — don’t feel bad about submitting to its effortless and convenient offerings.\n\nLean-forward listening\n\nMusic has always been important to me, and over the years, it started to feel like I had to gamify Spotify to find songs that I truly loved. When Spotify launched in 2011, it was basically a massive library of all the music, but over the years, it introduced more and more algorithmic recommendations and playlists that promised to match my taste. It still took work to find the good stuff.\n\nThis work is what has now made Spotify’s algorithms irreplaceable to me. It has a decade-and-a-half of my listening history, and over the years, I’ve learned its quirks and tinkered with it to meet my needs. I spent months trying to replicate this experience on Apple Music, but its algorithms struggled to surprise me.\n\nRelated Why I quit Spotify\n\nAll music streaming algorithms operate on two basic principles: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. The content-based filtering tries to identify specific aspects of a song itself, including the artist, genre, mood, and so forth, to queue up the next song. Collaborative filtering refers to recommendations made based on other people who listen to a certain song and what else they listen to. If two people listen to the same five songs, there’s a good chance they’ll both like this sixth song. It’s all math, and sometimes there are anomalies that will delight you.\n\n“Some of the serendipity that you get is sort of error turned into virtue,” Glenn McDonald, a former data alchemist at Spotify and creator of Every Noise at Once, told me. “So you’re surprised, and sometimes those surprises are pleasant.”\n\nIt’s not just that Spotify’s recommendations tend to be pleasant because it has a lot of data about me. It’s that Spotify has the listening history of 675 million people, whose interests may overlap with mine in countless different ways. Over the years, I’ve developed a set of habits that help me hone those recommendations — things like making playlists, rejecting recommendations I don’t like, exploring artists’ catalogs, and maybe most importantly, digging through other people’s playlists.\n\nThis is what I call lean-forward listening. While it’s easy enough to click on Discover Weekly every Monday, lean back and listen to the whole thing like a radio show, and then move on to the next playlist, the more effort you put into curating your experience, the better the algorithms will work next time. At the very least, you’ll find your way onto a playlist that algorithms didn’t create.\n\nHow to resist algorithmic rule\n\nLike them or not, algorithmic recommendations aren’t going anywhere. Companies like Spotify like them because — when they work — algorithms keep people hooked on their products. Companies like Amazon like them because algorithmic recommendations enable them to steer people’s behavior. The right product recommendation could lead someone to buy something they didn’t otherwise plan on buying. (We’ve all done it.)\n\nYou can probably learn to live with it when you’re talking about music on Spotify or burrito restaurants on DoorDash. “The stakes are a little bit higher when it comes to recommending things like products on Amazon, and even higher when it comes to recommending things like content on Facebook,” said Meredith Broussard, a data journalism professor at New York University. “Because, as we all know, disinformation and misinformation are very, very popular, but not good.”\n\nThe role algorithms, which are designed to boost engagement, play in spreading misinformation is a book-length topic. For now, I’ll just reiterate that you don’t have to lean back and let Facebook, Google, or X flood you with algorithmically generated information. You can learn more about how these platforms use algorithms and steer them to your advantage.\n\nIf you’re sick of the algorithm on X feeding you right-wing propaganda, try Bluesky, which lets you pick different algorithms for your feed. And if Netflix or any other streaming service has gotten stale, try nuking your view history and starting over. Spotify offers a list of details about how it recommends content and how you can make tweaks. And Amazon has a tool that’s designed to improve your recommendations. (I have tried all of these things, including the Amazon tool, which is very tedious but still possibly helpful.)\n\nThings get a little tougher on big platforms like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, whose algorithms tend toward the black box end of the spectrum. Still, knowing how algorithms work and playing an active role in making them work better for you can improve your experience on almost any platform. Algorithms are only in charge if you let them be.\n\nIn some cases, you might like it when the algorithm’s in charge. This is how I generally feel on Spotify, although I’m constantly correcting it and guiding it. This is also how I generally feel on Amazon, where I try to buy only the basics. I quit Instagram a while ago when I decided the algorithm was in charge a little too much. If I get bored one day, I might try it again.",

She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.\n\nA commuter wearing a protective mask enters a subway station in the Herald Square area of New York on Tuesday, May 12, 2020. Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn the first few months of the Covid-19 pandemic, the media did not exactly cover itself in glory. To quote myself from an early February 2020 piece, when the virus had already been spreading for more than a month in China and the US already had confirmed cases:\n\nIn the last week or so, new cases of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus have soared … so have news articles scolding us for worrying about it. “Don’t worry about the coronavirus. Worry about the flu,” BuzzFeed argued. The flu “poses the bigger and more pressing peril,” the Washington Post said. “Why should we be afraid of something that has not killed people here in this country?” an epidemiologist argued in the LA Times. Other outlets have agreed. An ex-White House health adviser has told Americans to “stop panicking and being hysterical.”\n\nMy article made the case that maybe it was slightly reasonable to worry about the coronavirus. But of course, I got some crucial stuff wrong, too. I wrote:\n\nSimilarly, there’s a conspiracy theory circulating that the virus escaped from a Wuhan research lab. (Not true.) And there’s a different conspiracy theory that it was engineered by Bill Gates (who funds a research group that has done pandemic-control exercises about a hypothetical deadly coronavirus). (Also not true.) Internet trolls have spread false claims that drinking bleach protects against coronavirus. (Please don’t do this.)\n\nTwo of those conspiracy theories were in fact absurd, but one was correct: the virus absolutely may have escaped from a Wuhan research lab. We’ll probably never know, but we know for sure that many of the scientists publicly asserting that this was a wild conspiracy theory privately worried that it was true.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Instead, almost everyone I talk to remembers another article that Recode (at that time a vertical of Vox) ran a week later.\n\nThe piece was headlined “‘No handshakes, please’: The tech industry is terrified of the coronavirus,” and while it doesn’t actually contain any blatant factual inaccuracies, the tone is very clear: Only a paranoid tech bro would be worrying about the coronavirus.\n\n“Data from the CDC suggests that the flu is a greater threat to Americans than the coronavirus. Yet unlike the flu, the coronavirus is new and not well understood, which makes it especially scary to the public, including Silicon Valley’s elite,” the article argues. But of course, even at that early moment in the pandemic, it was entirely correct to be more nervous about the novel coronavirus — which had a much wider range of possible outcomes — than a known health threat like the flu.\n\nAlmost no one I talk to here in the Bay Area about Vox’s performance on Covid-19 remembers my article pushing back on dismissiveness and warning people should take Covid more seriously. Almost all of them remember the contempt they felt that the Recode article was encouraging toward them.\n\nRelated What the media needs to get right in the next pandemic\n\nThe lesson here — for the media and for anyone who works in public communication — is that it’s much easier to lose trust than to gain it.\n\nMoving forward without ever looking back\n\nA few weeks later, Europe was hit hard with the first catastrophic Covid surges — hospitals overwhelmed, bodies piling up, patients struggling to breathe in hallways — and the media started taking Covid seriously.\n\nIn a sense, this is exactly what is supposed to happen — people saw new information and changed their minds. But the fact that there was an abrupt swerve was rarely acknowledged.\n\nWhen a journalist writes a piece that contains a clear factual inaccuracy requiring a correction, it’s a pretty big deal. I’ve had to issue corrections, and quite a few people are involved: my boss has to spend a fair bit of time working with me on the wording, and their boss has to sign off.\n\nCorrections are a high priority in the media — people will drop lots of other work to get a correction to a piece up. Journalists feel real pressure not to get things factually wrong, and to fix them when they do. A reporter having written several pieces that needed serious corrections is the kind of thing that will absolutely show up negatively on a performance review.\n\nBut there’s no clear mechanism for similar reflection when a piece doesn’t necessarily get the facts wrong, but just frames them wrongly. That’s a problem, because framing can do just as much to misinform readers as facts.\n\nThe price of ignoring getting it wrong\n\nIn the case of the Covid pandemic, early coverage that dismissed peoples’ fears and suggested they were irrational probably delayed our collective response — and lastingly decreased the credibility of the media and public health communicators when they later needed to muster a serious response.\n\nA lot of the fault here lies with public health officials, many of whom initially downplayed the threat and called the lab origin theory a conspiracy. But too often the media tended to treat these proclamations without the skeptical questioning that was warranted, especially given the uncertainty. And while I’ve chosen to highlight the early February spats over whether Covid was less concerning than the flu, this pattern repeated itself over and over again.\n\nThis story was first featured in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\n\nThe initial justification for lockdowns was that we just needed a few weeks to slow the spread so our first responders weren’t overwhelmed; but then those lockdowns persisted, without clear acknowledgment that the plan had changed. On masks, the line went from “masks don’t help much and should be reserved for first responders and doctors” (the contradiction here rarely acknowledged) to “masks are crucial.”\n\nOutdoor gatherings were always much safer than indoor ones (and I said so here in Vox from early on), but a lot of public health officials criticized outdoor gatherings — up until the Black Lives Matter protests, at which point they largely said such events were fine.\n\nEvery one of these changes happened without much reflection on why we had previously got it wrong. Every one of them spent credibility that was desperately needed with the American people. Every one meant treating people, frankly, like they weren’t very smart, and in the long run did incalculable damage to public trust.\n\nSo why hasn’t there been more of a reckoning? The primary reason is that there are incredibly powerful incentives for everyone involved not to participate in one.\n\nWith something as new and as fast moving as Covid, it was almost inevitable that everybody would get something radically wrong. When we open up the Pandora’s box of recriminations and accountability, our mistakes loom much larger than our correct calls.\n\nThe sociologist Zeynep Tufekci, one of the better pandemic commentators, wrote earlier this week about how we were lied to about the possibility of a Covid lab leak. She was met by near universal, seething hostility from Twitter, which blamed her for all of the New York Times’s bad coverage of everything related to the whole pandemic.\n\nA better way to cover uncertainty\n\nI’m expecting a similar overwhelmingly negative response to this piece, in which I admit a mistake — initially dismissing the lab leak theory — that everyone had probably forgotten about. Ours is a media environment that doesn’t encourage acknowledging your errors; it’s much safer to memory hole them.\n\nWith Covid, this has been made worse by the fact that there are still major disagreements over key questions about our response. I think that masks work to prevent the spread of disease, though I also think we made the wrong tradeoff in requiring kids to wear masks and generally refused to acknowledge what a major sacrifice they were for many people who just hated the feeling on their faces.\n\nBut that’s not satisfying to someone who thinks that all masking policy was a mistake and that a true Covid admission of errors would mean admitting that masks didn’t work, period. I think the vaccines were great, so my takeaways on the lessons from Covid won’t be convincing to the half of the country that thinks the vaccines were terrible.\n\nGiven all that, it’s not shocking that there hasn’t been a real Covid reckoning. But I think that has been very, very damaging.\n\nEvery single one of us lived through a devastating period during the pandemic. Many of us buried loved ones. Many worked to exhaustion in overcrowded hospitals. Many were asked to make sacrifices that they feel were later treated with contempt and indifference.\n\nIt was a massive, collective world-altering event — and now that it’s over we barely talk about it, because talking about it would mean reckoning with it and no one in power wants to reckon with it.\n\nSo Covid’s long-term effects will reverberate through the country: lower trust in institutions, an absolute unwillingness to think seriously about preventing the next pandemic, failing schools, and rising isolation. And all that will unfold without any real clarity on how we got here and how we can make sure it never happens again.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter.

They intensively lobbied policymakers, ran advertising campaigns, and funded think tanks to cast doubt on climate science.\n\nAccording to two new papers recently published in the journals Environmental Research Letters and Climate Policy, another industry knew of its role in climate change decades ago and engaged in similar tactics: the US beef industry.\n\nThe story begins in February 1989, when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) held a workshop for a report on how to reduce livestock methane emissions. Experts at the time knew that cattle produce significant amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change at a much faster pace than carbon dioxide. (Today, almost one-third of methane stems from beef and dairy cattle).\n\nThis story was first featured in the Processing Meat newsletter Sign up here for Future Perfect’s biweekly newsletter from Marina Bolotnikova and Kenny Torrella, exploring how the meat and dairy industries shape our health, politics, culture, environment, and more. Have questions or comments on this newsletter? Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!\n\nThere was also increasing awareness among scientists and environmentalists about livestock’s impact on other environmental issues, like water pollution and biodiversity loss.\n\nA representative from the nation’s largest and oldest beef industry group — the National Cattlemen’s Association (NCA) — attended the EPA workshop, and soon after, an arm of the organization began crafting a plan to defend itself against what they anticipated would be growing attacks over beef’s role in global warming and other environmental ills.\n\nThe Cattlemen’s plan — an internal 17-page memo titled “Strategic Plan on the Environment” — went unnoticed for decades until two University of Miami researchers, Jennifer Jacquet and Loredana Loy, recently unearthed the document in the NCA’s archives.\n\nNotably, the beef industry plan had barely a mention about addressing cattle pollution. Instead, it centered around how the public and policymakers would perceive that pollution.\n\n“Public relations activity directed toward key influencers is a fundamental thrust of this plan,” one part reads. Other goals of the plan: to positively influence legislation and regulations, and commission experts to write papers in response to critics as part of its “crisis management” strategy. They hired one such expert to address the EPA’s report, which came out in August 1989 and called livestock “one of the larger” sources of methane.\n\nA cattle feedlot near Lubbock, Texas. Richard Hamilton Smith /Design Pics Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nIn 1996, the National Cattlemen’s Association merged with another group to become the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. The organization didn’t respond to an interview request for this story.\n\nLooking back now, the plan seems to be the blueprint for how the beef industry, and the broader animal agriculture sector, would go on to respond to climate scientists and critics for the next 35 years.\n\nWhile these delay-and-obstruct tactics largely mirror those of the fossil fuel industry, there’s one way the two sectors radically differ in their public relations wars: what role they say consumers should play to combat climate change.\n\nWhat polluting industries want you to do — or not do — on a heating planet\n\nOver the past decade, many environmentalists have become critical of focusing on individual actions — such as purchasing a hybrid vehicle, using efficient light bulbs, or flying less — as meaningful solutions to climate change. Critics argue that putting the responsibility of fighting climate change on individuals has been a tactic purposefully employed by fossil fuel companies to help them evade accountability.\n\nThat’s largely true. BP popularized the personal carbon footprint calculator while Chevron — which, to be clear, is an energy company — has run ads encouraging its customers to use less energy. A 2021 analysis of ExxonMobil’s communications concluded that the company is “fixated” on individual responsibility.\n\nBut when it came to the meat industry, Jacquet and Loy found the opposite: It really doesn’t want people to take the individual action of eating less meat.\n\n“Rather than embrace notions of individual responsibility, the animal agriculture industry hired scientists, pressured the media, and formed business coalitions to obstruct” initiatives that encourage people to eat less meat, the two researchers wrote in the Climate Policy paper.\n\nEconomist Jeremy Rifkin speaking at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2017. Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for Ford\n\nOne of the earliest examples of such obstruction occurred in the early 1990s, when economist and activist Jeremy Rifkin published the book Beyond Beef: The Rise and Fall of the Cattle Culture. Rifkin paired the book launch with a large coalitional campaign featuring advertisements, mass protests at McDonald’s locations, and a book tour, all aimed at persuading people in 16 countries to cut their beef consumption in half and replace it with plant-based foods.\n\nA beef industry publication considered Rifkin’s actions a declaration of war and the industry organized a “determined counterattack,” according to the Chicago Tribune. That counterattack included an advertising campaign telling people not to blame environmental problems on cows and the formation of an alliance of 13 industry groups to push back against activists like Rifkin, which included tactics like handing out hamburgers at one of his events. Around this time, the Beef Industry Council launched the infamous but influential “Beef. It’s What’s for Dinner” marketing campaign with a budget of $96 million in today’s dollars.\n\nIt was effective: According to a 1992 story in the Washington Post, people screamed at Rifkin on call-in radio shows, his publisher received angry letters and phone calls, and his book tour was canceled early on because people called event hosts to either disparage him or pose as his publicist to cancel. Rifkin chalked it up in part to aggrieved cattle ranchers, a claim that the National Cattlemen’s Association fiercely denied at the time.\n\nThis back-and-forth fight over the American diet has continued ever since:\n\nMeatless Monday: The Meatless Monday campaign rose to prominence in the 2000s with celebrity support, featuring dozens of large university cafeterias and school districts ditching meat on Mondays, all of which angered the livestock sector. Meat industry lobbyists sent Baltimore City Public Schools\n\nThe Meatless Monday campaign rose to prominence in the 2000s with celebrity support, featuring dozens of large university cafeterias and school districts ditching meat on Mondays, all of which angered the livestock sector. Meat industry lobbyists sent Baltimore City Public Schools cease and desist letters for participating in the program, and an industry-funded academic at UC Davis named Frank Mitloehner called it a public policy tool to defeat animal agriculture. According to Jacquet, he also downplayed Meatless Monday’s potential to cut greenhouse gas emissions. (Disclosure: From 2012 to 2013, I worked at the Humane Society of the US on its Meatless Monday initiative.)\n\nUS Dietary Guidelines: In 2015, an advisory committee of government-commissioned nutrition experts recommended that the government modify the US dietary guidelines to encourage Americans to reduce meat consumption to make their diets more sustainable. In response, industry trade groups\n\nIn 2015, an advisory committee of government-commissioned nutrition experts recommended that the government modify the US dietary guidelines to encourage Americans to reduce meat consumption to make their diets more sustainable. In response, industry trade groups aggressively lobbied Congress and launched a petition that decried the committee experts as “nutrition despots.” Ultimately, the committee’s recommendation didn’t make it into the final dietary guidelines.\n\nThe EAT-Lancet report: In 2019, a In 2019, a landmark report published by nutrition and environmental experts recommended that people in high-income countries significantly cut back on meat for personal and planetary health. Mitloehner, the UC Davis academic, coordinated massive “#yes2meat” counter-campaign that spawned millions of tweets.\n\nSo why do fossil fuel companies and livestock producers seemingly have such a different take on personal responsibility? Jacquet says much of it comes down to the simple fact that consumers have relatively little flexibility in reducing fossil fuel use, so messages that encourage people to make lifestyle changes pose little actual threat to fossil fuel companies’ bottom line.\n\nIndividuals are “locked into a fossil fuel energy system,” Jacquet said. But “food is not like that,” she added. “You really do have a lot of flexibility in your diet, and you make those decisions three times a day. … These are really dynamic decision spaces, and that’s a threat” to the meat industry.\n\nTo state the obvious, individual dietary change alone is insufficient to reform the cruel, polluting factory farm system. But it is a start. To pass even modest regulatory reforms, policymakers will first need to see public support, and one way the public can show it is by eating less meat.\n\nNot only is it considered one of, if not the most effective individual actions to reduce carbon footprints, but dietary change also has cascading positive effects. Animal agriculture is arguably the leading source of US water pollution, a major air polluter, and far and away the main cause of animal suffering — around 25 land animals are factory-farmed each year to sustain the average American’s diet.\n\nAccording to agricultural economists Jayson Lusk and F. Bailey Norwood, eating less meat, milk, and eggs does affect how many animals are raised for food. It’s not on a 1:1 basis, but if more people reduce their animal consumption, they’d collectively send a signal to the industry to raise fewer animals.\n\n“It may be hard to see the consequences of our decisions,” the two wrote in their 2011 book Compassion, by the Pound: The Economics of Farm Animal Welfare, “but let there be no doubt, each purchase decision matters.”",

He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nA Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?\n\n“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent.\n\nAnd though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years.\n\nBut that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades.\n\nThere are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.\n\nClass warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nPart of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.\n\nAt its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.\n\nIn his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\n\nRelated Elon Musk and the age of shameless oligarchy\n\nThe hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards.\n\nWhy is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.\n\nThe concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.\n\nBut if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.",

He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nFederal law seeks to make communications technology like telephones and the internet, in the words of one older statute, “available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States.” A longstanding federal program that seeks to implement this goal is now before the Supreme Court, in a case known as FCC v. Consumers’ Research, and the stakes could be enormous.\n\nIf the Supreme Court accepts an argument raised by a federal appeals court, which struck down the federal program, it would bring about one of the biggest judicial power grabs in American history, and hobble the government’s ability to do, well, pretty much anything.\n\nThe Court will hear arguments in Consumers’ Research on March 26.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

In these areas, if telephone and internet providers charged a fair market rate, their services could be prohibitively expensive.\n\nWhich is why Congress created the Universal Service Fund. It effectively taxes telephone and internet service providers, and uses that money to pay for service to underserved communities. As a practical matter, service providers pass the cost of these taxes on to their customers in urban and other cheap-to-serve areas, so Americans living in cities wind up subsidizing telephone and internet in more sparsely populated regions of the country.\n\nBecause the amount of money the Fund must raise to achieve universal service will vary from year to year, Congress also tasked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with determining how much money the Fund should collect from service providers each year. The statute also provides the FCC with detailed instructions on how to determine the amount it should collect, and how that money should be spent.\n\nThis program has hummed along without incident for nearly three decades — the Fund was created in 1996 — until the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit abruptly declared it unconstitutional. If you’re familiar with the Fifth Circuit’s work, you know that this kind of thing is common. The Fifth Circuit is the most right-wing appeals court in the federal system, and its judges often strike down decades-old laws based on unusually creative interpretations of the Constitution.\n\nRelated The Trumpiest court in America\n\nThe Supreme Court, despite its 6-3 Republican majority, hands down a few cases every year reversing these Fifth Circuit decisions. Last May, for example, the Court reversed the Fifth Circuit’s attempt to strike down an entire federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nNevertheless, the Consumers’ Research case is worth watching for two reasons. One is that the Fifth Circuit’s decision was authored by Judge Andy Oldham, a Trump appointee who is widely considered a strong candidate for promotion to the Supreme Court in this administration. Oldham’s opinions are often sloppy, and his opinion in Consumers’ Research is no exception.\n\nThe second is that Oldham relied on a legal doctrine known as “nondelegation” in his opinion targeting the Universal Service Fund. The nondelegation doctrine claims there are strict constitutional limits on Congress’s power to empower federal agencies to do all kinds of things, from limiting pollution from power plants, to setting minimum standards for health insurance, to, at least if Oldham gets his way, providing broadband to rural communities.\n\nThe Supreme Court has only invoked this doctrine twice, both times in 1935, to strike down a federal law, and its decisions since then hold that the doctrine is more or less dead. Still, five of the Republican justices have, at various times, advocated for reviving the nondelegation doctrine. So there is a real risk that the Court could use the Consumers’ Research case as a vehicle to do so.\n\nIf that happens, it would shift a simply enormous amount of power from the elected branches of government to the judiciary. And it could potentially strip the federal government of a whole lot more than its power to equalize telephone and internet rates.\n\nWhy are the stakes in Consumers’ Research so high?\n\nCongress frequently enacts laws which lay out a general policy, then task a federal agency with implementing that policy and determining how to achieve it. The law creating the Universal Service Fund, for example, lays out the broad goal of taxing communications service providers and using that money to ensure that everyone has access to those services. But it is also recognized that the amount of money that needs to be raised to achieve this goal, as well as the question of how that money should be distributed, is a moving target that needs to be periodically reassessed by the FCC.\n\nOther laws delegate authority to an agency because technology evolves, and agencies employ experts who can monitor that technology and update federal policy accordingly. The Clear Air Act, for example, declares that certain power plants should use the “best system of emission reduction” that currently exists, while also accounting for factors such as costs. Because Congress recognized that the best system in 2025 will be more advanced than the best system that existed in 1972, it also tasked the EPA with determining what that system is and updating federal power plant regulations so that those plants use modern technology.\n\nThe stakes in the Consumers’ Research case are mitigated somewhat because the Court’s Republican majority has already given itself the power to veto federal agency actions.\n\nThe idea behind the nondelegation doctrine is that the Constitution limits Congress’s power to delegate power to agencies in this way, but there’s a big problem with it: The doctrine appears nowhere in the Constitution itself, so judges who wish to apply it cannot refer to any text to determine which delegations of power are not allowed. If nondelegation were revived, the only real factor governing which congressional delegations are allowed, and which ones must be struck down, would be whether five justices wanted to strike a particular law down.\n\nMany right-leaning legal scholars have argued that this extraconstitutional doctrine is implicit in the Constitution, but it’s noteworthy that the people who actually wrote the Constitution disagreed with them. The First Congress made sweeping delegations of power to executive branch officials, giving them, among other things, the power to set regulations governing “all things touching” trade with Indigenous tribes, and the power to grant patents so long as they “deem the invention or discovery sufficiently useful or important.”\n\nAnd so the Supreme Court has historically treated the nondelegation doctrine with extraordinary suspicion. The Court did apply it twice, in 1935, to New Deal statutes which gave virtually unbounded power to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but it has never done so again. Supreme Court decisions stretching back nearly a century permit Congress to delegate authority to federal agencies, so long as Congress “lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform.”\n\nThough the current Supreme Court has not, at least not yet, struck down a law on nondelegation grounds, it did invent a similar legal doctrine — which, like nondelegation, cannot be found in the Constitution itself — known as the “major questions doctrine.” Under this doctrine, a majority of the Court may veto any action by a federal agency which five justices believe to be too politically or economically significant.\n\nRelated How the Supreme Court put itself in charge of the executive branch\n\nSo the stakes in the Consumers’ Research case are mitigated somewhat because the Court’s Republican majority has already given itself the power to veto federal agency actions. But there’s also an important difference between major questions and nondelegation.\n\nUnder the major questions doctrine, the proper remedy, if five justices wish to veto an agency action, is to block that specific action — but to otherwise leave the federal law permitting the agency to act intact. The nondelegation doctrine, by contrast, often calls upon federal courts to toss out a statute delegating power to a federal agency altogether.\n\nBasically, the Court has already given itself the power to make a targeted strike on any individual agency action it doesn’t like, but it could use Consumers’ Research to carpet bomb agencies’ authority, stripping them of any power to act in the future.\n\nOldham’s Consumers’ Research opinion is extremely sloppy\n\nOne reason the justices might stay their hands in Consumers’ Research is that this case is a poor vehicle for reviving the nondelegation doctrine. The statute governing the Universal Service Fund provides detailed instructions to the FCC on how it should exercise its authority — far more detail than Congress provided in many other statutes that the Supreme Court has upheld against nondelegation challenges, including cases involving executive branch policy on navigable waters, natural gas rates, and commodity prices. Some of the statutes upheld by the Supreme Court do little more than instruct agencies to remove “unreasonable” obstacles to commerce.\n\nOldham should have followed these decisions, as he should have followed the Court’s precedents requiring him to uphold the Universal Service Fund statute so long as it provides an “intelligible principle” that the FCC can use to guide its decisions.\n\nThe Universal Service Fund statute lays out six goals that the FCC should accomplish, in its efforts to provide telecommunications access to rural and poor communities. It specifies who should be taxed (“Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute”), and who should benefit from this tax revenue. And it instructs the FCC on how to determine the rate of taxation.\n\nOne provision, for example, states that rural customers should receive service “at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.” Thus, the FCC must tax service providers at a high enough rate to ensure that rural customers pay similar rates to urban customers, but not at such a high rate that rural customers pay significantly less than urban customers.\n\nThere’s simply no question, in other words, that the Universal Service Fund statute provides an “intelligible principle” to guide the FCC’s decisions.\n\nThe Universal Service Fund would likely survive judicial review even under a more aggressive approach to nondelegation favored by some members of the Court. Dissenting in Gundy v. United States (2019), for example, Justice Neil Gorsuch proposed replacing the intelligible principle standard with a vague new rule providing that Congress must put “forth standards ‘sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts, and the public to ascertain’ whether Congress’s guidance has been followed” whenever it delegates power. Here, Congress has laid out definite and precise rules governing who the FCC should tax, how much it should tax them, and how that revenue should be spent.\n\nSo how, then, did Oldham justify striking down the Universal Service Fund? The answer is he took extraordinary liberties with the law, ignoring most of the statute, openly defying the Supreme Court’s decisions, and simply making up new rules along the way.\n\nAt one point, for example, Oldham claims that only two provisions of the statute are “relevant” to determining whether it violates the nondelegation doctrine — a provision stating that the FCC should raise funds “sufficient…to preserve and advance universal service,” and another provision indicating telecommunications services “should be available at…affordable rates.”\n\nIf these were the only instructions the statute provided to the FCC, then Consumers’ Research might be a more difficult case. But, of course, Congress said a whole lot more than these two things when it instructed the FCC on how to wield its authority.\n\nOldham also relies on a concurring opinion, by Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones, which the Supreme Court repudiated last spring. He places a simply enormous amount of weight on the fact that the FCC created a corporation, known as the Universal Service Administrative Company, which advises it on how to set Universal Service Fund rates. But the Supreme Court held in Sunshine Anthracite Coal v. Adkins (1940) that these sorts of advisory bodies are “unquestionably valid.”\n\nIt appears, in other words, that Oldham started with the result he wanted — striking down the Universal Service Fund — and then wrote an opinion pretending that the law actually supports his preferred outcome.\n\nSo how is the Supreme Court likely to approach this case?\n\nRealistically, it is unlikely that even this Supreme Court will strike down the Universal Service Fund. The statute is too detailed, and Oldham’s opinion is too nonsensically argued, to justify the result the Fifth Circuit wants to achieve.\n\nOne thing to watch out for, however, is whether the Republican justices attempt to shift the law governing nondelegation cases, while still upholding the Fund. The Court could, for example, write an opinion repudiating the intelligible principle test and upholding the Fund under Gorsuch’s “sufficiently definite and precise” standard — a standard that, because of its vagueness, would give judges far more discretion to strike down laws they do not like on nondelegation grounds.\n\nSo, while Oldham is unlikely to succeed in his ambitious attempt to sabotage the Fund, he may nonetheless achieve a significant victory. By ignoring the law in his Consumers’ Research opinion, Oldham gave the justices an opportunity to revive a dangerous legal doctrine, and to do so in an opinion that appears moderate compared to the reactionary Fifth Circuit.",

        "content": "The finding, released this week, relies on data from the American Time Use Survey and shows that in 2023 about one in four Americans ate all of their meals alone the previous day, an increase of 53 percent since 2003. The analysis also found that eating meals solo, including at home or out at a restaurant, has become more common in all age groups, but most pronounced among those under 35.\n\n“The extent to which one shares meals,” says Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, a professor of economics and behavioral science at the University of Oxford and co-editor of the World Happiness Report, “is an extraordinary proxy for measuring people’s social connections and their social capital. It underpins people’s social support. It drives prosocial behaviors, and all of that, in turn, leads it to be a very strong indicator — predictor — for people’s life satisfaction.”\n\nEconomic factors, like high income and employment status, are often used as indicators of happiness. But researchers found the ritual of sharing meals to be an even more effective indicator of general well-being than job status and salary. “That surprised us as a research team,” De Neve says.\n\nThe most obvious driver of solo dining is the rise of solo living. The share of single-person households in the US has steadily increased since the 1940s, when just under 8 percent of homes were occupied by one individual. By 2020, that number had grown to 27 percent. But even those who cohabitate choose to eat their meals alone. In 2023, about 18 percent of Americans who lived with others ate all of their meals alone the day prior, the report found, compared to 12 percent in 2003 — a 50 percent increase.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

As social media and smartphones became more entrenched in the 2010s, the less often people shared meals with others. (De Neve has no explanation for the spike in solo dining in 2011.)\n\nResearch shows that those who eat with others are happier, more satisfied with life, more trusting, have more friends, and are more engaged in their communities.\n\nThe finding also points to increasingly individualistic habits. Solitary pursuits branded as “self-care” may have led to increased isolation. The top reason cited by those who considered eating alone in restaurants in 2024 was to get more “me time,” according to consumer research polling from OpenTable and Kayak.\n\nThe rise of solo dining has implications beyond the table. Research shows that those who eat with others are happier, more satisfied with life, more trusting, have more friends, and are more engaged in their communities. Increased social isolation meanwhile can lead to feelings of loneliness, which, in turn, can lead to cardiovascular health risks and increased feelings of depression, risk, and anxiety.\n\nOn a broader scale, loneliness and solitary tendencies breed distrust, which has profound consequences for the state of civil society. The simple act of sharing a meal with a colleague or friend can help bridge divides and increase well-being.",

He is particularly interested in global health and pandemic prevention, anti-poverty efforts, economic policy and theory, and conflicts about the right way to do philanthropy.\n\nIf the bipartisan consensus around helping foreigners had two spokespeople, it’d be George W. Bush and Bono. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n\nI have, like I suspect many readers, been in quite a bad mood for the last two months. My go-to joke explaining why — which I feel like should land with readers of this newsletter — has become: “I didn’t realize quite how much my overall optimism about the state of the world depended on the fact that Lindsey Graham likes foreign aid.”\n\nTo unpack that a bit: For many years, the US spent tens of billions annually on foreign aid, including billions on vaccinations, preventive gear, and treatments for cheap-to-treat killers like HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis.\n\nIt did that not because a bunch of bleeding-heart liberals have been in power continuously for decades, but because a critical mass of conservative Republicans like Graham (and former President George W. Bush, and former House foreign affairs chair Michael McCaul, etc.) genuinely supported foreign aid, often out of sincere moral conviction. Aid actually grew dramatically under Bush, and remained roughly constant through President Barack Obama’s time in office and during Donald Trump’s first term.\n\nThis story was first featured in the Future Perfect newsletter. Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.\n\nThis, obviously, has not been the story of foreign aid under Trump’s second term. Already, his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, acting as the US Agency for International Development’s (USAID) interim head, has canceled programs amounting to at least a third of USAID’s annual spending. Some areas were hit even harder: Efforts to improve maternal and child health are in for an 83 percent cut, and pandemic prevention is getting a 90 percent cut. (On Wednesday, a federal judge said that the Trump administration’s efforts to close USAID were likely unconstitutional and ordered the government to reinstate USAID systems, though it’s anyone’s guess how meaningful that ruling will prove to be.)\n\nDespite Elon Musk’s lies that the cuts in funding haven’t killed anyone, the lack of funds at HIV clinics caused by Musk, Rubio, and Trump has already led to children dying. Journalist Nick Kristof has some of the names of the dead. Working with the Center for Global Development, he estimates that more than 1.6 million could die within a year without HIV aid and prevention from the US.\n\nGraham, to his credit, has been pushing back, particularly in defense of PEPFAR, the US’s wildly successful anti-HIV program. So has McCaul. It just hasn’t mattered: The administration has seized control of spending from Congress, particularly on foreign aid matters, and so the bipartisan coalition that kept aid programs alive for decades has been largely helpless. Graham liking foreign aid has proved to be a less important positive for the world than I had thought.\n\nThis is an example of a broader, alarming trend in American politics that has been slowly unfolding over the past 10 or 15 years. At least going back to the 1980s, there was a kind of informal, cross-party consensus in the US around a set of policies that opened the US economy, and sometimes government coffers, to the world.\n\nIt was an era of elite cosmopolitanism, and that era feels like it is coming, or has come, to a close.\n\nThe globalist golden years\n\nThere were, of course, important and significant differences between the parties on a huge variety of issues during the period I’m talking about (let’s say 1986 to 2016, roughly, though I’m not wedded to either specific year). But on many international economic questions, there was broad consensus.\n\nBoth parties championed free trade. Ronald Reagan negotiated a tariff-reduction pact with Canada, and instead of reversing course, Bill Clinton followed that up with NAFTA and the creation of the World Trade Organization; Bush and Obama followed up with trade deals of their own.\n\nBoth parties championed immigration. In 1986, Reagan signed a law providing amnesty for undocumented immigrants, and both Bush and Obama supported bipartisan congressional efforts to give legal status to those who came after that year.\n\nThe foreign aid part of the consensus is more recent. In the 1990s, USAID was hollowed out in terms of both staff and funding, both due to the end of the Cold War (removing a geopolitical reason for it to operate in countries at risk of Communist takeover) and due to a sustained assault from Senate Foreign Relations Chair Jesse Helms (R-NC), a dedicated foreign aid opponent and outspoken racist.\n\nBut foreign aid got a surprise second act under George W. Bush, who not only created and poured billions into PEPFAR, but also launched the President’s Malaria Initiative (which became one of the world’s leading anti-malaria funders) and made the US the first country to donate to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a major multilateral funder. Obama and Joe Biden supported these efforts, and they survived budget cut proposals during the first Trump term due to bipartisan congressional support.\n\nDespite the slightly different chronologies, I think lumping these three areas of bipartisan consensus — trade, immigration, and aid — together makes sense.\n\nAll of them involve American openness to foreign countries. All of them have benefited from “bootleggers and Baptists” coalitions combining moralists and baser economic interests.\n\nSome activists supported migration on moral grounds, but the US Chamber of Commerce was arguably the biggest booster; reducing trade barriers obviously helped businesses importing tariffed goods or exporting to tariffing nations, but many architects of trade liberalization felt a moral duty to use trade to help poorer countries like Mexico and China to grow; foreign aid serves a national security purpose in boosting US soft power, but Bush’s main motive in reviving it, and the main motive of most pro-aid activists I know, was a sense of moral duty.\n\nAll three issues, then, reflected a kind of light noblesse oblige on the part of US political elites. They were willing to take significant actions to help people born abroad, either staying there trying to survive (aid), staying there and trying to work (trade), or coming to the US (immigration).\n\nTheir willingness was not purely due to altruism. There were economic and geopolitical motives at work too. But the positive effects on billions of foreign-born people were real nonetheless.\n\nWhy the consensus fell apart\n\nIf this elite cosmopolitanism was able to support large-scale immigration, low trade barriers, and generous foreign aid for decades, why has it not been able to stop the Trump administration from devastating all three?\n\nIt’s not because the public suddenly changed its mind. While the Biden term was a period of historic anti-immigrant backlash, the consensus started fraying in Obama’s second and Trump’s first terms, when anti-immigrant sentiment was, perhaps surprisingly, at a low ebb. In June 2016, only 38 percent of voters said that immigration should be decreased, compared to 65 percent in 1993 and 55 percent in 2024.\n\nBut while restrictionists were a minority in 2016, they became a much louder and more influential one. The mass refugee flows from the Syrian civil war meant that the topic had higher salience in the US and especially in Europe. Most importantly, Trump broke basically every social taboo about discussing the topic during his primary run, and not only didn’t suffer but won the nomination as a result.\n\nIt wasn’t a majority position — Trump would lose the popular vote after all — but it was clearly more potent than previously thought.\n\nThe 2016 race also scrambled the politics of trade. Bernie Sanders’s stronger-than-expected challenge to Hillary Clinton led her to come out against Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, an anti-China trade pact that she passionately advocated for as secretary of state; she clearly saw in the strength of Sanders, and Trump, evidence that trade restrictionism had become a political imperative.\n\nClinton’s eventual loss due to Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania led to a folk understanding among professional Democrats that not passing protectionist measures to help Rust Belt states would be electoral suicide.\n\nThis never made any sense; the shock of competition from China and elsewhere did hurt these places, but it’s long since over and no policy measures could ever bring manufacturing employment in Detroit back to where it was in 1970. But this conclusion meant that both parties were running away from open trade simultaneously, and as a result, the US as a whole has retreated from free trade over the last decade.\n\nIt is also possible, as political scientist Margaret Peters has argued, that immigration support has suffered precisely because trade was liberalized in the 1990s and ’00s. Historically, nativist forces have been kept at bay because of business lobbies supporting immigration, but the ability to offshore manufacturing to foreign countries provided an alternative for businesses to bringing in foreign laborers to the US.\n\nPeters argues that this effect, not just of trade deals but of things like standardized shipping containers, has undermined support for immigration over time by taking business lobbyists off the board. There go the bootleggers.\n\nThe saddest case, though, is foreign aid. Why did this tiny portion of the federal budget come in for such a beating this year?\n\nI don’t really have deep structural answers. Foreign aid has never been very popular, and voters routinely overestimate how much the US spends on it. It has always survived on elite, not popular, support, and was in a vulnerable position should someone like Elon Musk go after it. The declining religiosity of American conservatism also weakened the evangelical forces who so strongly supported PEPFAR under Bush.\n\nAs for why Musk had such a vendetta against foreign aid, the best explanation is that he fell under the influence of rabidly anti-USAID conspiracy theorist Mike Benz. He wouldn’t be the first dubious source who Musk decided against all reason to trust absolutely.\n\nPut all together, though, and the picture looks bleak for anyone who thinks the US can play an important role in making the lives of people around the world, not just here at home, better. In three different domains, the fragile coalitions supporting that vision have cracked and been beaten back. I’m not throwing in the towel just yet. But the game is going very badly.",

        "content": "On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. And while, within a few weeks, that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges, it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the questions: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In the video above, we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.",

And colleges across the country are taking similar steps to protect their own funding.\n\n\n\nWhat other choice do they have? To fight. Perkins Coie, another firm whose security clearances Trump targeted, sued. And, last week, a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration from enforcing Trump’s order, finding it likely violates the firm’s First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights. (In response, the Trump administration today tried to get the judge kicked off the case.)\n\n\n\nWhat’s the big picture? These are powerful institutions with vast resources. Yes, they’re still less powerful than the federal government, and yes, they have plenty to lose. (The Times reports that Paul, Weiss considered its own legal challenge but deemed the financial risk too high.) But we all have even more to lose if the rule of law is replaced by a system in which the president can use the federal government to pursue personal vendettas and enforce compliance with his agenda.",

Previously, Sean was Vox’s weekend editor.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waits outside of the West Wing before welcoming King Abdullah II of Jordan to the White House in Washington, DC, on February 11, 2025. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe spate of federal firings that stretched throughout last week escalated last Friday, and continued through the holiday weekend.\n\nNearly all of those fired were “probationary” employees, a status usually conferred on new workers, those that switch agencies, and the recently promoted, that provides fewer protections against removal.\n\nReports have been unclear about exactly how many people were fired and where. However, we do know some details:\n\nThe Trump administration has argued these cuts (and more) are needed to slash federal spending, and to shrink a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, the latest reduction in force is unlikely to provide taxpayers with major savings, and could jeopardize the government’s mandate to protect its citizens.\n\nTake, for instance, the VA’s claim that its terminations will save $98 million per year. That is a lot of money to me, but it represents only 0.00145 percent of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Celebrating that cut is like me jumping for joy because I managed to save a tenth of a penny by foregoing something at the grocery store. Sure it’s money saved, but not really an appreciable sum.\n\nThe point is — and it’s a point others have made — the US will need to make massive cuts, on the trillion, not million, dollar scale if it really wants to appreciably tighten its belt. To do that, it would need to slash spending on expensive programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense.\n\nNow to the other claim: that the government is too big.\n\nMuch like with the VA’s savings, those let go represent a fraction of the federal workforce. If you combine the latest round of layoffs with previous rounds — and even with the roughly 75,000 people who took the government’s buyout offer — then just under 4 percent of the government’s 2.4 million person workforce has been cut.\n\nThat means the government is still pretty big. The good news about that is it means government services are unlikely to keel over tomorrow. The worry is about the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe’re not out of fire season, and fire experts and Forest Service workers are expressing great concern that they won’t have the manpower to keep communities safe.\n\n“It’s just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this season,” one Forest Service firefighter told Stateline.\n\nSpring break and summer travel season are coming in fast too. The FAA was clear that it didn’t fire any air traffic controllers, but, as you read in this newsletter a few weeks ago, aviation experts believe our flight systems are seriously overtaxed.\n\n“Right now, flight operations are like a rubber band,” the University of North Dakota’s Daniel Adjekum told me recently. “And we keep pulling it.”\n\nAnd it’s not just a matter of fire or flying: a disaster could happen at any time requiring FEMA’s full attention; the CDC might need to be called into action over a new pandemic — federal agencies were already struggling to get bird flu under control.\n\nIt’s impossible to tell you right now what the effects of these cuts will be, and if things will go as badly as some now claim. But the worry is, if things do go south due to lack of personnel, it will be too late — avoidable tragedy will have struck.",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox. He covers a wide range of political and policy issues with a special focus on questions that internally divide the American left and right. Before coming to Vox in 2024, he wrote a column on politics and economics for New York Magazine.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris holds a campaign rally at the Jenison Field House on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, on November 3, 2024, in the final days before the election. Adam James Dewey/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nDemocrats have spent months debating how and why they lost the 2024 election. But the full picture of what happened on Election Day is only now coming into view.\n\nThe most authoritative election analyses draw on a variety of different data sources, including large sample polling, precinct-level returns, and voter file data that shows definitively who did and did not vote. And those last figures became available only recently.\n\nThe Democratic firm Blue Rose Research recently synthesized such data into a unified account of Kamala Harris’s defeat. (Blue Rose Research did ad testing for Future Forward, the largest PAC supporting Harris, which had disputes on strategy with the campaign itself.) Its analysis will command a lot of attention. Few pollsters boast a larger data set than Blue Rose — the company conducted 26 million voter interviews in 2024. And the firm’s leader, David Shor, might be the most influential data scientist in the Democratic Party.\n\nI spoke with Shor about his autopsy of the Harris campaign. We discussed the problems with the popular theory that Democrats lost because of low turnout; why zoomers are more right-wing than millennials; how TikTok makes voters more Republican; where Donald Trump’s administration is most vulnerable; what Democrats can do to win back working-class voters; and whether artificial intelligence is poised to turbo-charge America’s culture wars, among other things. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nBefore we get into why Democrats lost the 2024 election, let’s talk about how they lost it: Which voting blocs shifted the furthest right over the past four years?\n\nThe most important thing is that we saw incredible polarization on political engagement itself. There’s a bunch of different ways to measure this: There’s how many elections you vote in, or how important politics is to your identity. There’s how closely you follow the news. But across all of these, there’s a consistent story: The most engaged people swung toward Democrats between 2020 and 2024, despite the fact that Democrats did worse overall.\n\nMeanwhile, people who are the least politically engaged swung enormously against Democrats. They’re a group that Biden either narrowly won or narrowly lost four years ago. But this time, they voted for Trump by double digits.\n\nAnd I think this is just analytically important. People have a lot of complaints about how the mainstream media covered things. But I think it’s important to note that the people who watch the news the most actually became more Democratic. And the problem was basically this large group of people who really don’t follow the news at all becoming more conservative.\n\nIf they’re not responding to mainstream media information, where are they getting their views on politics? Is this group reacting to the prices at the grocery store, or firsthand experience of changes in the economy, immigration, or culture?\n\nMost people have to balance their reaction to objective facts in the economy with their preexisting ideological beliefs. A strongly Democratic voter isn’t going to switch to Trump just because they’re upset about high prices. So, it isn’t too surprising that the people with the weakest political loyalties would be the most responsive to changes in economic conditions.\n\nThis story was first featured in The Rebuild. Sign up here for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.\n\nAnd people who are politically disengaged — like every other subgroup of people this election — overwhelmingly listed the cost of living as the thing they were the most concerned about.\n\nBut it can’t just be inflation. Politically disengaged voters went from being a roughly neutral group in 2020 to favoring the Republicans by about 15 points in 2024. But during the Obama era, this was a solidly Democratic group, favoring us by between 10 and 15 points. So there’s also this long-term trend that goes beyond inflation or social media. Our coalition has been transitioning from working-class people to college-educated people.\n\nTo move beyond the why, this shift in the partisanship of politically disengaged voters has a really important implication: For most of the last 15 years, we’ve really lived in this world where the mantra was “If everybody votes, we win.” But we’re now at a point where the more people vote, the better Republicans do.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, you’re suggesting that Democrats cannot rebuild a national majority merely by juicing higher turnout, since registered voters as a whole were more pro-Trump in 2024 than those who actually showed up at the polls.\n\nNevertheless, many progressives have attributed Harris’s loss to depressed turnout among Democratic voters specifically. They point to the fact that, between 2020 and 2024, the Democratic presidential nominee’s vote total fell by significantly more than Trump’s tally increased. And they also note that, according to AP VoteCast, only 4 percent of Biden 2020 voters backed Trump last year — while a roughly equal percentage of Trump 2020 voters switched to Kamala. So, in their telling, if defections roughly canceled out while a large number of voters went from supporting Biden to staying home, then clearly the problem was inadequate Democratic turnout. So if Harris had focused more on energizing the progressive base, she might have won. What do you think is wrong with that narrative?\n\nWell, the problem with the AP VoteCast data is that it was released the day after the election. There was just a lot of information that they didn’t have at the time. At this point, voter file data has been released for enough states to account for an overwhelming majority of the 2024 vote. And what’s really cool about having that data is that you can really decompose what fraction of the change in vote share was people changing their mind versus changes in who voted.\n\nAnd when you do that, you see that roughly 30 percent of the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024 was changes in who voted — changes in turnout. But the other 70 percent was people changing their mind. And that’s in line with the breakdown we’ve seen for most elections in the past 30 years.\n\nThe reality is that these things always tend to move in the same direction — parties that lose ground with swing voters tend to simultaneously see worse turnout. And for a simple reason. There were a lot of Democratic voters who were angry at their party last year. And they were mostly moderate and conservative Democrats angry about the cost of living and other issues. And even though they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, a lot of them stayed home. But basically, their complaints were very similar to those of Biden voters who flipped to Trump.\n\nThe reality is if all registered voters had turned out, then Donald Trump would’ve won the popular vote by 5 points [instead of 1.7 points]. So, I think that a “we need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone” strategy would’ve made things worse.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nAccording to your data, voters who got their news from TikTok were much more likely to swing to the GOP than other voters, even after controlling for demographics. Why do you think that is?\n\nI think people can debate how much of this is the nature of the algorithm versus the strategic choices that the parties made. A lot of people argue that maybe TikTok just helps negative content get promoted, and that’s naturally bad for whoever’s the incumbent. But TikTok is also really different from social media that came before.\n\nOther social media sites are very dependent on what people call “the follower graph.” If you look on Instagram Reels, for example, the correlation between how many views a video gets and how many followers the creator has is extremely high. On TikTok, it’s quite a bit lower than any other platform. And the reason is TikTok uses machine learning to analyze a video — and make a good guess about whether it will be appealing — before they show it to anyone. So if your video is likely to be engaging, it can get wide distribution even if you don’t have a following. And that has been genuinely democratizing.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nWe used to live in this world where in order to get your message out there, you had to get people who write really well to absorb your message and put it out. And now, we’re in a world where anyone can make a video and if that video is appealing, it’ll get out there. And this is naturally bad for the left, simply because the people who write really well are a lot more left-wing than the overall population.\n\nOne of my favorite stats on this is something that Nate Cohn put out a couple years ago: Working-class white voters who’ve read a book in the last year are much more Democratic than working-class white voters who haven’t.\n\nSo what other groups did Democrats lose ground with, beyond those who pay little attention to politics and TikTok enthusiasts?\n\nIf you look at predominantly immigrant neighborhoods, whether they’re white or Hispanic or Asian or African, you really see these absolutely massive shifts against Democrats. Trump won Corona in Queens. Immigrants go from a D+27 group in 2020 to a potentially R+1 group in 2024.\n\nI’m not sure why that happened. I think we’re still waiting for data to come back. But I’d guess it’s the same stories about the cost of living and cultural issues and ideological polarization.\n\nSpeaking of ideological polarization: One of the findings in your data is that nonwhite voters who identify as “conservative” or “moderate” have been voting more and more like their white ideological counterparts over the past few elections. So, the electorate is polarizing less on race and more on ideology.\n\nI feel like there’s an argument that this was inevitable: Hispanic and Asian Americans were always likely to follow the political trajectory of other immigrant groups, many of which were tethered to the Democratic Party for the first couple of generations but then started to polarize ideologically as they became more affluent and assimilated. And you could perhaps tell a similar story about Black Americans, in which the easing of extreme racial oppression and segregation makes it easier for conservative African Americans to consider voting for the GOP.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Democrats just made some avoidable mistakes that alienated these constituencies. So I’m wondering how you understand this development?\n\nIf we look at 2016 to 2024 trends by race and ideology, you see this clear story where white voters really did not shift at all. Kamala Harris did exactly as well as Hillary Clinton did among white conservatives, white liberals, white moderates.\n\nBut if you look among Hispanic and Asian voters, you see these enormous double-digit declines. To highlight one example: In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates. Fast-forward to 2024; Democrats got only 57 percent of Hispanic moderates, which is really very similar to the 51 percent that Harris got among white moderates.\n\nYou know, white people only really started to polarize heavily on ideology in the 1990s. Now, nonwhite voters are starting to polarize on ideology the same way that white voters did.\n\nIf you look at African Americans, they did not swing nearly as much. But in our polling, before the Kamala switchover, Black voters were poised to swing 7 to 8 percentage points against us.\n\nAs to whether this is inevitable, I would say that to some degree getting 94 percent of any ethnic group is unsustainable. But I think the losses that we’re seeing among nonwhite voters and immigrants is symptomatic of this broader, ideological polarization that Democrats are suffering from.\n\nFundamentally, 40 percent of the country identifies as conservative. Roughly 40 percent is moderate, 20 percent is liberal, though it depends exactly how you ask it. Sometimes it’s 25 percent liberal. But the reality is that, to the extent that Democrats try to polarize the electorate on self-described ideology, this is just something that plays into the hands of Republicans.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily as ideologically restrictive as people think. If you look at moderates — and especially nonwhite moderates — a bunch of them hold very progressive views on a variety of economic and social issues. A very large fraction of Trump voters identify as pro-choice. We’ve seen populist economic messaging do very well in our testing with voters of all kinds. But I think that there are also some big cultural divides between highly educated people who live in cities and everybody else. And to the extent that we make the cultural signifiers of these highly educated people the face and the brand of our party, that is going to make everyone else turn against us.\n\nOne surprising thing Young people have been one of the most reliably Democratic constituencies for more than a decade. According to the Democratic data firm Catalist, Joe Biden won voters under 30 by 23 points in 2020. But Blue Rose Research’s data suggests that Trump narrowly won that demographic in 2024.\n\nHow do young voters fit into this? In my understanding, young voters shifted significantly against Democrats in 2024.\n\nYeah. So this is related to the other trends: Young people are more nonwhite than the overall electorate. They’re more politically disengaged than the overall electorate. But the single biggest predictor of swing from 2020 to 2024 is age. Voters under 30 supported Biden by large margins. But Donald Trump probably narrowly won 18- to 29-year-olds. That isn’t what the exit polls say. But if you look at our survey data, voter file data, and precinct-level data, that’s the picture you get.\n\nAnd if you look at people under the age of 25, every single group — white, nonwhite, male or female — is considerably more conservative than their millennial counterparts. And it even seems that Donald Trump narrowly won nonwhite 18-year-old men, which is not something that has ever happened in Democratic politics before.\n\nSo, young people are quite a bit more right-wing than they were four years ago. And a lot of that is replacement. It’s a different set of young people. It turns out, people age.\n\nWhat’s your sense of why this generation of young people is more conservative than we were? Is it about each cohort’s distinctive formative experiences? In my understanding, political events that transpire during your adolescence and early adulthood can shape your worldview in a durable way. So, maybe the millennial generation came of age during the disaster that was George W. Bush’s second term, and then associated Democrats with an incredibly charismatic two-term president in Barack Obama — while young zoomers associated Democrats with Covid and inflation under Biden? Or is something else at play?\n\nYeah, I think some of that story is true. Yair Ghitza has an incredible paper that shows that people have formative political years. And you can predict a lot of how conservative someone will be from how popular the incumbent president was when they were teenagers or when they were in their 20s. And so I think that’s definitely true and it’s definitely part of the story. But I think that there’s more to the story than that.\n\nIf you look at the millennials, the millennials were more left-wing in a bunch of countries — Canada, the UK, and Europe. I think that there’s a story you can tell: Baby boomers were an incredibly left-wing generation in most places in the world. And millennials were their kids.\n\nBut Gen X was really quite a bit more conservative than the Boomers in most countries. And there’s a lot of theories you can make about that — response to the oil shocks, stagflation, neoliberalism. But whatever the reason, Gen X came out more conservative. So I think that part of the story is simply that the current crop of young people had Gen X parents. And in our surveys, if we ask people, “How Democratic were your parents growing up?” zoomers are something like 7 percent more likely to say they had Republican parents than millennials are.\n\nBut isn’t part of the Democrats’ problem with younger voters about men, specifically?\n\nYeah. There’s also this enormous amount of gender polarization. If you look at the gender gap — just what fraction of the vote Kamala Harris got versus what fraction of the vote Donald Trump got among men and women — for voters over the age of 30, there was about a 10 percent gender gap between men and women. And that’s, roughly speaking, where it’s been in American politics for most of the last 20 years.\n\nBut if you look at voters under the age of 25, the gender gap has doubled in size. And if you look at 18-year-olds specifically, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to vote for Donald Trump than 18-year-old women. And gender polarization seems to be increasing in other countries as well. How it plays out varies from country to country. In Germany, for example, young women voted in very high numbers for Die Linke, the left-wing party there.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nA lot of different things could be causing this. But I think that if you look at non-political polling, you can really see evidence that there is wild, cultural change afoot here and basically everywhere else in the online world. In Norway, there’s a poll of high school students where the fraction of young men saying, “gender equality has gone too far” spiked in recent years.\n\nI don’t know necessarily what the answer to that is. But I think it’s important to resist nihilism. These young men who have terrible, retrograde views on politics and gender relations are still pro-choice. They still support universal health care. I think we need our politicians to focus on those fights. But it’s extremely important for other people — who don’t need to win elections — to try to improve the online discourse around these more divisive issues.\n\nEarlier, you referenced the divide between cosmopolitan, college graduates who live in big cities and working-class voters. And you suggested that Democrats need to distance themselves from the sensibilities of highly educated urbanites. I’m wondering if you could get more concrete. Do you think the party merely needs to increase the salience of its best issues by focusing on them rhetorically? Or are there areas where you believe Democrats need to become substantively more conservative?\n\nI think there are two very important things to understand about this election. The first thing is that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular. His approval ratings collapsed after Afghanistan and then continued to decline as prices went up and immigration happened. The budget fights in the fall of 2021 around the reconciliation package were particularly damaging. And then, his approval ratings never really recovered. And so, I think there’s a substantive angle to that.\n\nThe way that we like to track issues is that we look at 40 different issues and we ask people basically, “How important are these issues?” And then, “What party do you trust more on these issues?”\n\nIn 2020, what people cared about the most was Covid and health care. And those were also the issues that people trusted us on the most. And so the thing we had to do was very straightforward: We just had to talk about Covid and health care. That’s what we did. And we won.\n\nBut the situation this time was a lot harder. The issue that voters cared the most about was overwhelmingly the cost of living. I really cannot stress how much people cared about the cost of living. If you ask what’s more important, the cost of living or some other issue picked at random, people picked the cost of living 91 percent of the time. It’s really hard to get 91 percent of people to click on anything in a survey.\n\nAfter the cost of living, it was the size and scope of the federal government, the budget deficit, immigration, crime, and also health care. And people trusted Republicans on these issues by double-digits — except for health care, where we had a 2-point advantage, which was much lower than our traditional advantage on that issue.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nI think there’s this nihilism that’s very popular in our industry — that nothing we do, or that the other side does, really matters. But in the wake of inflation, voters went from favoring Republicans by about 5 points on the economy to favoring them by 15 or 16. And after Dobbs, voters started trusting the Democrats much more on abortion. Education used to be the Democrats’ strongest issue. But our standing on that collapsed during Covid, and now it’s basically even. So, what people care about and trust us on really is responsive to concrete events that happen in the world. That isn’t 100 percent of the story. There are a lot of other things going on. But what we do and what we say does matter.\n\nTo directly answer your original question — about how much of this is changing what our positions are versus messaging — I think the exact details of that vary from issue to issue. But I think that we have to approach this from the position that we are in a deep trust hole. The people that we’re trying to persuade have very different values than we do and have a very different perception of reality. And a lot of these people are very poorly informed and literally do not consume the sources of information that we broadcast to.\n\nAnd so, there has to be some combination of messaging and outreach and changes in how we approach these platforms, and also probably some substantive changes that address what voters see as an error.\n\nIt seems to me that the Democratic Party’s biggest challenge is less how to win the presidency than how to win comfortable Senate majorities. The median US state is much more conservative than America as a whole, and this means that the Senate is heavily biased against Democrats. In 2018 and 2020, Democrats won really strong national victories — and still ended up with just 50 Senate votes in 2021. So, how grim do you think the party’s prospects of winning back the Senate are in the near term, and how can it go about improving those odds?\n\nI think we should start by recognizing how lucky we are. In 2020, we won basically every competitive Senate race. And in both 2022 and 2024, we saw something that I had never seen before, which is that we did a lot better in swing Senate races than we did nationally.\n\nBut a lot of that was the other side running terrible candidates. And we can’t count on that happening forever. And even despite that — even despite historically well-run campaigns and historically weak opposition — here we are four years later at 47 Senate seats and with a very difficult path to getting back to 50 even in a wave Democratic year.\n\nAnd I think that something has to change in order for us to have a majority that’s capable of securing the Senate. But I don’t want to overemphasize the ideological dimension of that. What we really need to do to win in places like Ohio and Iowa is change the brand.\n\nThe candidate who outperformed the most in 2024 at the top of the ticket was Dan Osborn in Nebraska. And some of that was just because he ran as an independent. But a lot of it was that he ran an economically populist campaign that focused on issues that people cared about. I think that the moderate and left-wings of the party don’t like each other very much, but they did both like Dan Osborn.\n\nTo push back a little on that, Osborn definitely ran a populist campaign. But he also aired advertisements declaring himself “the only real conservative” in the race, attacked his Republican opponent for voting to fund the government, said that he would personally help build Trump’s border wall, and didn’t endorse Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd so, I feel like there definitely was an element of ideological moderation — or at least, heterodoxy — to his approach. More critically, Osborn refused to say which party he would caucus with once he got to the Senate. And yet, assuming he secretly did intend to caucus with the Democrats, that’s a play you can only run a single time. After that first run, voters know which party you really favor. And it doesn’t seem tenable for Democratic Senate candidates writ large to all pretend that they support Trump or might actually caucus with Republicans. So it’s not clear to me how the Osborn model scales.\n\nI think the main problem is that we tried this strategy in an incredibly red state. I think Trump won Nebraska statewide by 20.5 points. But there are a bunch of states he won by between 4 and 7 points. The degree of ideological compromise that is necessary to win in a state like Ohio is very different than the degree of ideological compromise that’s necessary to win in a state like Nebraska. And the current status quo is that we have a very low chance of winning in these places at all using the current strategy. But that said, I think that both wings of the party have to make sacrifices in order for us to achieve the coalition that we want.\n\nThere’s an interesting tension in your polling: Voters generally say that they would like the Democratic Party to be more moderate, while also saying they favor “major change” and a “shock to the system” because things in America are going poorly. I think many people would look at that and see a contradiction. After all, moderate Democrats generally have less enthusiasm for major policy change — and feel more comfortable with the status quo — than progressive Democrats do.\n\nIt’s tricky. On the one hand, voters say they thought that the Democratic candidate was too liberal. But on the other hand, in our randomized control trials, the best testing advertisements were more compatible with progressive critiques of the Harris campaign. The single best testing ad by the Kamala Harris campaign was one where she looked directly into the camera and said something like, “I know the cost of living is too high, and I’m going to fix that by building more housing and taking on landlords who are charging too much.”\n\nAnd I think you can get into existential debates about what economic populism really is. But I think that the existing research really pointed clearly toward the idea that the electorate wanted economic change — and cared more about that than preserving America’s institutions.\n\nWhatever you want to say about Trump, he has delivered a “shock to the system” — though maybe not the one that voters were hoping for. In your polling, has there been a reduction in support for the president since he took office? If so, where do you see him as being most vulnerable?\n\nYeah. Trump’s approval rating has dropped since he took office. His ratings on his handling of the economy, which historically was a strong suit for him, have dropped the most, and his handling of cost of living has also gone down by quite a bit. And Elon Musk has become much more unpopular and is now the most unpopular member of his administration by a good deal. Trump and Elon have really spent the first part of their term diving into the biggest weaknesses of the Republican Party — namely, they’re trying to pass tax cuts for billionaires, they’re cutting essential services and causing chaos for regular people left and right, while trying to slash social safety net programs. It’s Paul Ryan-ism on steroids.\n\nI think we have a real opportunity to return to the politics of 2012, in terms of vigorously opposing these very unpopular economic changes that Trump is pushing through.\n\nThe presentation that you’ve been giving to Democratic stakeholders takes a sharp turn at the very end. You warn that the party cannot get stuck fighting the last war, and argue that 1) AI is going to cause mass unemployment in the relatively near future, 2) this social and political shock is likely to exacerbate partisan tensions in the US, and 3) Democrats need to start preparing for this scenario. Can you explain your reasoning?\n\nI’m not an AI expert by any means, but AI capabilities are increasing dramatically. And AI experts are very, very bullish on the extent to which AI systems are going to be able to replace some fraction of jobs. The prediction markets say this, too. And I think something that’s really important is that regardless of whether it’s going to happen or not, the public believes it will happen.\n\nIf you just ask, “Do you believe that AI will be able to perform most people’s jobs better than humans can in the next 10 years?” 65 percent of the population says yes and 35 percent says no.\n\nAnd then, when you ask, “Do you think this will be good or bad?” Something like 80 percent of the population believes that this is going to be bad. And so, I think this is something where voters are ahead of the political classes of both parties right now.\n\nI think when you try to speculate about something like this, it’s important to recognize that nothing like this has ever really happened before, so it’s hard to make predictions. But we worked with two economists, Jonathan Hersh and Daniel Rock, who have made fine-grained estimates of which jobs are going to be the most affected by AI and which the least. And their work indicates that this will impact college-educated people more than working-class people for the simple reason that LLMs are advancing more quickly than robotics is. And AI will also have a bigger impact on employment in cities and suburbs than in rural areas. And it will impact women more than men.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nAnd I really worry that this may accelerate these cultural divides that politics have been centered on in the last decade, in a way that could be unproductive and dark. In a lot of ways, this could be the biggest culture war fight of the century. And I don’t pretend that I have the answer on what we should do. But with Covid, we had this sudden shock and our response just reinforced the dysfunctional cultural divides that had already opened up in 2016. And those effects have persisted and made it harder for us to win elections today. But unlike with Covid, we have a real chance of seeing this next shock a year or two ahead of time. And we really have to think about this proactively and not just dig our heads into the sand.\n\nCorrection, March 18, 12pm: Trump won Nebraska statewide by about 20.5 points.

A 2019 fellow of the National Critics Institute, they’re considered an authority on fandom, the internet, and the culture wars.\n\nLate in Hulu’s new series Good American Family comes a moment of irony that’s become all too familiar in true crime docudramas. The fictionalized Natalia Grace Barnett — at this point in the story a teen, being played by the 27-year-old Imogen Faith Reid — glowingly reads supportive comments from random internet strangers. “I feel so bad I doubted you, Natalia,” one comment reads, “But I guess that’s what the media wanted.”\n\nAh, yes: the ancient narrative that the media made a complicated situation worse, being proffered by a piece of media that’s currently making it worse.\n\nGood American Family dramatizes the twisted saga of Natalia Grace, a Ukraine-born adoptee who was born in 2003, 1989, or somewhere in between, according to a litany of contradicting stories and court records. The new series’ interminable eight episodes rehash the saga many Americans first learned about in 2019, when her second set of adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, gained media attention for adopting and then abandoning her in the US when they moved to Canada without her. The Barnetts publicly claimed that their daughter was an evil, murderous 20-something con artist pretending to be a little girl.\n\nYes, it’s the plot of the movie Orphan, but in real life. (To be clear, Natalia Grace’s tale did not inspire the 2009 movie, as she was adopted in 2010, but may well have been inspired by it.) The Barnetts’ behavior resulted in ultimately unsuccessful criminal charges of neglect. Though the messy details of this back and forth are recounted for viewers, including the accompanying media spectacle, the Hulu series ultimately does little to justify itself, either as entertainment or as a further examination of an abuse victim whose entire life has been lived under a magnifying glass as a result of her abuse.\n\nHere’s what to know about the saga of Natalia — and why the Hulu docuseries probably isn’t the last time you’ll be hearing her name, even though it probably should be.\n\nNatalia was 6 or 7 — or maybe 8 or 9 — when she was adopted in 2010\n\nBy their own telling, Indiana residents Kristine and Michael Barnett and their three sons were an all-American family: Kristine would go on to author a much-lauded book about raising her son Jacob, who is a high-functioning child prodigy. The memoir, The Spark, was so popular it was nominated for a Goodreads Choice Award in 2013 — but while it details Kristine Barnett’s miraculous job parenting her sons, it reportedly contains no mention whatsoever of the little girl she adopted alongside them.\n\nThe Barnetts adopted Natalia in 2010. According to Michael Barnett, they were only given 24 hours by a shady adoption agency to make a decision about adopting her, and were provided very little information about Natalia’s background and medical history. What we know is that Natalia’s birth mother had been born in Latvia and was living in Ukraine at the time of Natalia’s birth, which was listed on Natalia’s birth certificate as September 4, 2003. She placed Natalia in an orphanage. In 2008, at the age of 5, she was brought to the US by Dyan and Gary Ciccone, a New Hampshire couple with ties to an area adoption agency focused on Russian adoptees. What happened is unclear, but Natalia’s unsuccessful placement underscores the often murky and dysfunctional process of adoption, especially international adoptions, which can exploit children.\n\nImogen Faith Reid, Ellen Pompeo, and Mark Duplass in Good American Family. Disney/Ser Baffo\n\nThe Barnetts immediately ran into problems with the adoption. They claimed that Natalia, who was born with dwarfism, was showing signs of puberty, including menstruation and pubic hair, despite being only 6 or 7 according to her official birth certificate. They also claimed that Natalia had tried repeatedly to kill them, including by placing thumbtacks on the stairs, pouring Pine Sol into coffee, wielding knives, and allegedly pulling Kristine Barnett into an electric fence. According to Michael Barnett, their response to these incidents included begging the police to arrest their 7-year-old; police declined. Child services were alerted to the situation, however, and began investigating the couple’s treatment of their daughter. During the same period, the Barnetts had Natalia seen by various medical experts, apparently in attempts to determine her “real” age. Medical providers in the Barnetts’ lives have since come forward to allege that they told the Barnetts Natalia was a child.\n\nTo this day, it’s not fully clear whether the Barnetts actually believed their own lie about Natalia being an adult, or whether they just made it up as an excuse to be rid of her. Kristine Barnett has fallen back on the medical advice she claims she was given by experts, while Michael Barnett has emphasized the court rulings concerning her age; the new Hulu docuseries depicts him as being manipulated by Kristine’s own narcissism, though not without culpability.\n\nIn 2012, the Barnetts successfully petitioned a probate court to change Natalia’s official birth year from 2003 to 1989, which made her legally 22 years old instead of 8. According to court documents, the change was made “based on age estimates provided by a primary care physician and a social worker,” without holding an evidentiary hearing or providing Natalia with her own legal representative in the matter. This also meant that the child services case was closed, since Natalia was now legally an adult.\n\nAround the time of this ruling, Natalia spent nine weeks in a mental hospital. She also spent time at a halfway house. The Barnetts rented two subsequent apartments for her, including one in Lafayette, Indiana — a decision made, according to court testimony from a state police detective, “Because Kristine said Lafayette is a white-trash town and nobody is going to care or worry about [Natalia].” The Barnetts also appeared to disbelieve that the physical disabilities associated with Natalia’s medical condition were real; though she had used a walker since she was a child, the apartment they rented for her was on the second floor of a house with no easy street access. After relocating Natalia to this isolated, inaccessible house in Lafayette, the Barnetts moved to Canada with their sons in 2013, leaving her behind. Natalia never saw Kristine Barnett again.\n\nThe couple divorced in 2014 — but their entanglement with Natalia was only just beginning.\n\nThe courts perpetuate a wrong and then fail to redress it\n\nFollowing her abandonment by the Barnetts in 2013, Natalia was taken in by Cynthia and Antwon Mans and their children. (Some reports say the Mans have 10 children, others say five.) Over the next decade, Natalia and others tried repeatedly to have her age change reversed in the courts, only for the courts to reaffirm that she was an adult. Natalia was legally considered an adult for most of her childhood. At one point, per court records, the Mans attempted to gain legal guardianship over Natalia, only for Michael Barnett to block their efforts because, he claimed, Natalia was an adult.\n\n“All I was told was, ‘You’re 22 now,’” Natalia later told ID’s multi-season docuseries about the saga, The Curious Case of Natalia Grace. “‘Whenever somebody asks you what your age is, you say you’re 22 and you tried to murder your family.’ I was taught to lie.”\n\nProsecutors soon became interested in Natalia’s case. Confusion over Natalia’s actual age began to dominate the investigation into the Barnetts’ behavior, which was serious enough that they were each charged separately in 2019 with criminal counts related to both child neglect and neglect of a dependent [adult]. The child neglect charges were ultimately dismissed due to the outstanding quandary of her age.\n\nIn 2023, a DNA lab conducted testing that seemed to conclusively put the matter of Natalia’s age to rest: she was likely around two years older than the age indicated by her birth certificate at the time of her adoption, born around 2001. At the time of her adoption, she would have been 8 or 9, and at the time of her abandonment in Lafayette, she would have been 11 or 12 — not 23, as the court system legally claimed.\n\nBut because the original court ruling still stood, in 2020, prosecutors had to drop all charges related to child neglect. At Michael Barnett’s 2022 trial for neglect of a dependent adult, Natalia testified against her adopted father. She alleged that she had fallen repeatedly while attempting to navigate her inaccessible apartment, and that the Barnetts had left her to fend for herself without teaching her how to access her disability payments or perform basic tasks like laundry or food preparation.\n\nMichael Barnett’s lawyer, however, was able to successfully allege that at 23 — the only age Natalia was legally permitted to acknowledge under the court ruling — she should have been able to do all of those tasks as a functioning adult. Defense attorneys also implied that the Mans family were manipulating and exploiting Natalia — allegations of stealing benefits that would linger after the trial. Jurors ultimately found Michael Barnett not guilty on the neglect charge, and the pending charges against Kristine Barnett were subsequently dropped.\n\nFrom there, despite the mudslinging, it seemed as though things were finally resolved between Natalia and the Barnetts. By that point, however, the Barnetts, Natalia, and the Mans were something more than a set of dysfunctional squabbling families — they were all reality stars.\n\nFrom one messy situation to another\n\nIn late 2019, the news of criminal charges laid against the Barnetts began to make headlines, and the lives of all involved irrevocably changed. Tabloid media quickly labeled Natalia a “‘Psycho’ dwarf,” and Natalia and the Mans family went on Dr. Phil — and all of this was within weeks of the story coming to light.\n\nThen came ID’s multi-season docuseries, The Curious Case of Natalia Grace, which began airing in 2023 shortly after the court proceedings. By that point, Natalia was living with the Mans family, who the docuseries framed as her saviors. The Mans, who claimed Natalia had never been dangerous at all, formally adopted her in 2023 — when she was around 21 — in a splashy event that made up part of the show’s second season.\n\nThe pressure to provide TV drama may have been too much for the Mans family, however. Despite caring for Natalia for nearly a decade without issues, they abruptly dramatically leaned into the “Natalia is evil” theme, with Antwon Mans calling the show’s producers to allege that her behavior had been disturbing and selfish. The ID producers, naturally, revealed this development as a shocking twist and a season-ending cliffhanger.\n\nIn the documentary’s third season, Natalia accused the Mans family of physical and emotional abuse. To the Hollywood Reporter, ID president Jason Sarlanis described the docuseries’ decision to delve into Natalia’s time with the Mans as “do[ing] right by our audience” — whether anyone considered doing right by Natalia and her new family dynamic was less clear.\n\nIn 2023, Natalia left the Mans family’s Nashville residence and moved in with yet another family: The DePauls, a family of little people who reportedly wanted to adopt Natalia all the way back in 2009, prior to her adoption by the Barnetts. The ID series filmed them helping Natalia dramatically “escape” from the Mans in the middle of the night, into a new wholesome life with a family who hopefully could finally understand her.\n\nA happy ending? Yes and no. While there’s little left to say about Natalia’s story at this point, it’s clearly going to keep going in the public eye. In January 2025, People placed now 23-year-old Natalia on the cover, with the lurid headline “Victim or Villain?” even though years of reporting within its own pages make the answer abundantly clear. Hulu’s Good American Family similarly plays with blaming a disabled child for her own abuse. On top of that, the show drags out over eight episodes and features a parade of flat, dull characters. Ellen Pompeo as Kristine is especially one-note, narcissistic and brittle with little nuance, while Mark Duplass as Michael goes through a histrionic and unbelievable series of emotional swings as he wrestles with who to believe. The Mans are depicted as well-meaning grifters who rescue Natalia but aren’t without their own issues.\n\nThough it ultimately fully accepts the framing that the Barnetts emotionally and physically abused and gaslit Natalia to a heartbreaking degree, it also initially perpetuates the idea that Natalia’s behavior is alarming and disturbing. Above all, casting 27-year-old Reid to play a child 20 years younger at the time the series starts does more to confuse the narrative than clarify it. While the narrative depicts Natalia as finding closure, it’s hard not to see the show leaving the door open for another season, just as ID has done again and again.\n\nWhat’s more, Nicole DePaul recently alleged on Facebook that the docudrama had not compensated Natalia in any way for the use of her story — though they were, she claimed, compensating Kristine Barnett, perhaps in the hopes of staving off a lawsuit. (Hulu did not respond for comment.)\n\n\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time that a high-profile true crime docudrama has been castigated for exploiting victims. But instead of learning any lessons from those other cases, or even from Natalia’s own story, it seems we’re destined to repeat these same mistakes in the quest for drama — with diminishing returns.",

He’s worked at Vox since the site’s launch in 2014, and before that, he worked as a research assistant at the New Yorker’s Washington, DC, bureau.\n\nConservative activists have been dreaming of dismantling the Department of Education for decades.\n\nThey’re closer than ever to achieving their goal.\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that he said would “begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all.” That comes after, earlier this month, the Department of Education announced mass firings of its workforce, which would cut the department staff down to about half of what it was when Joe Biden left office — from about 4,000 to about 2,000.\n\nTrump had promised to abolish the department on the campaign trail, but since it was established by Congress and many of its functions are legally required, he can’t make it go away with a stroke of a pen. Instead, his team is slashing its personnel and will likely try to cut back its spending to the greatest extent they think they can get away with.\n\nNow, it’s very unclear how big the policy impact of these layoffs will actually be. The biggest things the Education Department does in practice are sending money to public schools that have many low-income students, sending money to help educate students with disabilities, and running the federal student loan program. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has said that the department would keep doing all these things — though staff cutbacks seem likely to make such services more dysfunctional.\n\nBut all this is an important symbolic victory for ideological conservative activists. Because, ever since the Education Department was created as a standalone agency in 1979, they’ve wanted it gone.\n\nThese activists generally argue that education should be a local matter without federal “interference.” Many of them also disdain the public school system and support bolstering private alternatives (or home schooling).\n\nFor 45 years, they kept on failing to get their way, even when Republican presidents were in power. For much of that period, the GOP was split on education: Anti-government conservatives wanted the federal government to stay away, but other Republicans saw a federal role in improving public schools.\n\nPlus, it was widely believed that abolishing the department would lead to political backlash and was likely impossible without congressional approval — so why bother trying?\n\nBut the past decade, and especially the past few years, have seen major shifts in the politics of public education and inside the conservative coalition — shifts that have finally made the time right for a full assault on the department.\n\nWhy conservative activists are finally getting (half of) their way now\n\nThe first shift was a bipartisan disillusionment with the federal efforts to boost learning in public schools that were embodied in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002. NCLB was championed by Republican George W. Bush, but was ultimately criticized by both the left (too much focus on testing) and the right (too much government interference).\n\nOnce NCLB was repealed in 2015, Republicans essentially abandoned the idea that the federal government should try to improve public schools, which removed one rationale for keeping the Education Department around. (Back in 2018, Trump announced a plan to merge the Department of Education with the Department of Labor, but it went nowhere.)\n\nThe second, more recent shift is backlash among rank-and-file Republicans against public schools, due to anger over their handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and culture war issues in the past few years. The right frames this as parents recoiling against the incompetence or ideological extremism of educators, administrators, and unions; the left frames this as conservatives targeting public schools with an exaggerated campaign of vilification.\n\nBut the result was that typical Republican voters became more open to shaking up the status quo on public education. That can be seen in the flurry of “universal school choice laws,” which allot families public funds to pay for private school tuition, that have passed in red states in the 2020s.\n\nSo abolishing the Education Department became a frequent applause line for Trump during his 2024 campaign — his newfound focus on this was no secret. Eliminating the department was the main theme of Project 2025’s education chapter, too — though this was no surprise, as the think tank behind the project, the Heritage Foundation, has been calling for that for decades.\n\nStill, even after Trump won another term, there was widespread skepticism that he could actually do it, given the belief that congressional approval would be necessary, and that Democrats would never agree.\n\nThat’s where the third change comes in: the entry of Elon Musk and DOGE to the conservative coalition. They have modeled a new approach to dismantling the agencies they dislike, something that has never really been tried at this scale. And now it’s the Department of Education’s turn in the barrel.",

He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like The Atlantic, Gizmodo, and Vice.\n\nThe next phase of Elon Musk’s plan to entangle his companies with the workings of the federal government is well underway. That entails not only President Donald Trump’s photo op with a Tesla in front of the White House but also, surprisingly, the future of your internet connection.\n\nMore specifically, Musk is making moves that could change the way millions of Americans access the internet by boosting Starlink, the satellite-based internet company operated by his company, SpaceX, of which he is the founder, CEO, and major shareholder.\n\nStarlink and other space-based internet projects work by beaming internet service from satellites in orbit down to Earth’s surface, as opposed to wired broadband internet, which typically relies on fiber-optic cable. Satellite internet’s major advantage is that, with a few exceptions, it can work almost anywhere on the planet. Its drawbacks — including slow speeds, high latency, and spotty reliability — mean that fiber internet is better for the vast majority of people right now.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nIn the last week or so, the Commerce Department said it plans to rewrite the rules of a $42 billion high-speed internet initiative in a way that would benefit Starlink. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) meanwhile granted Starlink a waiver that will make its new service, which lets phones connect to satellites, more powerful, as satellite competitors urged the agency to rein in Musk’s company, which they say is “anticompetitive.”\n\nMusk affiliates have also reportedly instructed government agencies to start using Starlink. The White House is now using Starlink “donated” by the company “to improve internet access on the campus,” according to the New York Times, and the General Services Administration has also been using the service, apparently without oversight. SpaceX confirmed that it’s leasing Starlink kits to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), amid reports that the agency might cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon and award it to Starlink instead. The company denied that it was trying to take over the contract.\n\nThere are billions of dollars at stake here, but this isn’t just about the money. (Musk doesn’t really need it.) Some people are worried that these developments represent the early steps of a power shift in the telecom industry, one that could result in the world’s richest man deciding how the nation’s communications network works.\n\n“We have never before had a situation where the owner of a major communications company is inside the government. This is a very unusual situation.”\n\nIn addition to hacking away at the federal government in his unelected position as the head of DOGE, Musk could also become the single individual who is “the dominant force in telecom policy,” according to Blair Levin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and former chief of staff at the FCC. What’s more, the US telecommunications system is key to national security, and Musk’s business interests might not always line up with Washington’s.\n\n“We have never before had a situation where the owner of a major communications company is inside the government. This is a very unusual situation,” Levin said. “It’s very troubling.”\n\nSome of this must sound hyperbolic. It’s also hypothetical — for now. I’ve been writing about Starlink since before it launched its first batch of satellites in 2019, and from bringing remote parts of the world online to connecting Ukrainian soldiers at war, there’s no doubt that the technology is incredible.\n\nBut if recent events are any indication, the Trump administration plans to advantage Starlink in ways that benefit Musk more than the people who need better internet service. It also opens the door for Musk to become a much bigger power broker in the telecom world — and have more of a say in how you get online.\n\nElon’s space internet is not better than Earth internet yet\n\nIt’s tempting to think Starlink is the future of internet service. It’s very easy to set up, which is a huge deal to anyone who lacks broadband access — soldiers in Ukraine, for example, or farmers in rural America. But Starlink is not the same as the fiber-based broadband that’s become the gold standard for internet access.\n\nFor a number of reasons, space internet isn’t as fast, as reliable, or as cheap as terrestrial broadband. That’s why Congress prioritized companies that lay fiber-optic cable with the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, which provides federal funding to bring high-speed internet access to as many as 8 million Americans who have never had it, as part of the 2021 infrastructure bill. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick now wants to make the program “technology neutral,” a change that would increase Starlink’s chances of getting grants. Whereas Musk’s company was on track to receive a little over $4 billion under the old rules, Starlink could now get between $10 billion and $20 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the Commerce Department goes through with the proposed changes to the BEAD program, its implementation would be delayed — more than one expert told me it would be by at least a year. Which is ironic given that Republicans made delays in BEAD’s rollout a talking point during the 2024 election. This process involves digging miles of trenches for tubes of cables that connect far-flung parts of the country. It takes time and costs money, but this infrastructure would last for decades.\n\n“It is truly a historic opportunity to get fiber to a lot of these places,” Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, told me. “We’ll probably never have another opportunity like this.”\n\nStarlink dishes are easy to set up, but they don’t offer the same speed and reliability as fiber. Cate Dingley/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSome argue that Starlink and other satellite-based internet companies could get people online more quickly and without the expense of laying fiber. Starlink already has more than 7,000 satellites in orbit and is trying to add more. But it’s unclear how quickly Starlink could actually add more users, since the company already has a waiting list for people to sign up because its network is at capacity.\n\nThat’s not to mention the fact that, for now, Starlink is neither faster nor cheaper than terrestrial broadband. Starlink delivers download speeds of 50 to 100 Mbps, while the FCC defines broadband as 100 Mbps. The average download speed in the US is about 275 Mbps. Starlink also currently charges customers $80 a month for its “Residential Lite” service, while the average US internet bill is $78 a month.\n\nThis is what makes the Trump administration’s apparent preferential treatment of Musk’s company so frustrating. It’s a poorer solution that takes longer and doesn’t result in savings for most Americans.\n\nMusk posts Starlink into the FAA\n\nWe don’t yet know how things will shake out with BEAD. The Commerce Department could change its mind, and the broadband infrastructure expansion could break ground in a few states this spring. However, the Trump administration is already starting to use Starlink in unusual ways.\n\nThe FAA, like many federal government agencies, is dealing with massive staff cuts at the behest of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Just days after 67 people died in a midair collision near Washington’s Reagan Airport, Musk’s staff urged FAA staffers to accept buyout offers, which more than 1,300 of them did, according to The Atlantic. DOGE also ended up firing about 400 FAA employees. When Musk’s team tried to lay off air traffic controllers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy finally intervened.\n\nRelated The year space internet takes off\n\nAt the same time — and operating on orders from Musk himself — a SpaceX engineer started to deploy Starlink technology on FAA systems. Musk posted on X that “the Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly,” that “the situation is extremely dire,” and that he would send Starlink dishes to the rescue. The FAA has since confirmed that it’s reviewing the $2.4 billion Verizon contract and testing Starlink equipment at several locations, including in Alaska, New Jersey, and Oklahoma.\n\nMusk’s posting-fueled intervention at the FAA is a scary one. Almost single-handedly, the billionaire threw cold water on a contract with Verizon, one that will affect the safety and security of Americans. Although it’s not clear if Starlink will indeed take over this particular contract, we have a glimpse at what it looks like for a singular bureaucrat — one that sells satellite dishes that don’t always work — to call the shots.\n\n“If you’re downloading stuff to your house in a rural area, and your speed drops because the system is oversubscribed, that’s annoying,” said Harold Feld, senior vice president of Public Knowledge. “If you’re the FAA, and your speed drops because the capacity is oversubscribed, that’s deadly.”\n\nProject 2025’s surprising role in all this\n\nElon Musk and DOGE, which is run by employees of Musk’s companies, certainly appear to be operating within the federal government to promote the best interests of those companies. The “why” of it all will take some time to figure out. Less than two months into Trump’s second presidency, we’re too busy keeping track of what’s even happening, especially where Musk is involved.\n\nAs for Starlink and Elon Musk’s apparent ambitions to dominate the US telecom industry, the FCC’s cooperation is essential. And Brendan Carr, the agency’s new chair, happens to be a big Elon Musk fan. Carr first made contact with Musk on X, where the two exchanged complaints about Democrats denying Starlink broadband subsidies and blamed Kamala Harris for rolling BEAD out too slowly. Carr was also the author of the chapter on the FCC for the big report published by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. In it, he argues against terrestrial broadband expansion and in favor of accelerating the development of satellite technology, like Starlink.\n\nStarlink constellations look spectacular after they launch, but each satellite only lasts five years in orbit. George Rose/Getty Images\n\nOne of Project 2025’s main goals is to “dismantle the administrative state,” and in Musk, the right found a key ally. Musk has also found an opportunity: When the bureaucrats are all fired, someone still has to make decisions, and it’s easier to move quickly without any oversight.\n\nAcross the world, people are setting Tesla dealerships on fire to protest Musk’s gutting of the federal workforce and hoping to tank its stock. But what’s happening more quietly with Starlink, the Commerce Department, and the FCC shows that the multibillionaire isn’t just interested in making money. He’s consolidating power in Washington and helping determine what the future will look like.\n\nSelling cars is one thing, but taking control over America’s telecommunications network is another. Musk is not there yet, but we have already seen Musk use Starlink specifically to intervene in military operations abroad — he prevented Ukraine from launching a surprise attack against Russia in 2022. That sets a scary precedent for what the future holds.\n\n“Elon Musk has been pretty cavalier about his ability to turn on or turn off Starlink to influence policy decisions,” Garner, from the Benton Institute, told me, referring to a series of recent posts on X from Musk about cutting off Starlink access in Ukraine.\n\nIt’s not just scary that Musk is becoming more powerful in the telecom industry. It is uniquely terrifying that he alone could decide to bring networks down. And that might be an even more important development to keep our eyes on than the Tesla ad he produced in front of the White House.\n\nUpdate, March 18, 9:45 am ET: This story was originally published March 12 and has been updated to include news of the White House’s use of Starlink.",

He worked at Time magazine for 15 years as a foreign correspondent in Asia, a climate writer, and an international editor, and he wrote a book on existential risk.\n\nIf you’re anything like me — a policy dork who spends too much time on X — you’ve been unable to escape discussion of a new book called Abundance.\n\nWritten by the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson and the New York Times’s Ezra Klein (also a co-founder of Vox), Abundance is one of those policy books with one big idea that everyone has to have an opinion on — whether they’ve read it or not.\n\nIn Abundance, Thompson and Klein’s big idea is that American politics and life for the past 50-plus years has been warped by an “ideology of scarcity” that has artificially reduced the supply of vital goods like housing and energy through a growing thicket of government restrictions and regulations. They argue for embracing a politics of abundance that encourages building and innovation and unlocks American prosperity, aiming for a future of “more” rather than “less” for everyone.\n\nThompson and Klein are self-identified liberals, and their book is mainly meant to diagnose what they see has gone wrong with Democratic governance in recent decades, as progressives have consciously adopted policies that aim to put limits on growth. They point to the examples of Democratic cities like San Francisco or New York, where regulations have made it virtually impossible to build new living spaces, putting the cost of housing out of reach for more and more people.\n\nEven on issues that Democrats care deeply about, like climate change, their policies have inadvertently had the effect of slowing progress by making it difficult to build out the vast amount of clean energy needed to reduce carbon emissions without hurting the economy.\n\nRelated\n\nThe result was that even as technological progress continued, we stopped feeling it and we stopped appreciating it — a consistent theme of this newsletter. Instead, bit by bit, and often with the best intentions, we put countless invisible brakes on development, with the net result that we reduced the supply and raised the price of the goods that we needed for a good life. And once we lost the ability to build physically, we lost the ability to build a better future.\n\nAbundance isn’t just for Democrats\n\nGiven how much of Abundance focuses on where Democrats went wrong, the book has ignited debate among progressives. If you want to read more about that but don’t want to get lost in endless post threads or three-hour-long podcasts, my Vox colleague Eric Levitz has a great piece on the arguments and why Democrats should heed the message of Abundance.\n\nBut it’s a mistake to think of Abundance as a book that has meaning only for readers who vote blue. At its heart is a message that matters for Americans of all political backgrounds: we don’t have to fight endlessly over who gets what piece of a shrinking pie. For far too long we’ve let ourselves be convinced that we have to treat American life as a zero-sum game, but we can change the rules. We can embrace policies that actively grow that pie — policies that make housing more affordable in the places people want to live, that give us energy to power a high-tech economy without burning up the planet, that bring us better health care at lower costs.\n\nThompson and Klein recognize that Americans will never agree on everything, that there are issues where there are simply fundamental differences between the right and the left. But they’re right to argue that most Americans want a better life for themselves and their children, and that a politics focused on improving material progress in the areas that matter — housing, education, energy — is one that can appeal to almost everyone. As Thompson wrote in the Atlantic this week, abundance can “combine the progressive virtue of care for the working class and a traditionally conservative celebration of national greatness.”\n\nIf we can do that, we might just be able to break the polarization that has gridlocked progress and turned American politics into a winner-takes-all death match.\n\nI’m sure not everyone who reads Abundance will agree with every page. Diagnosing the mistakes that have held back progress is a lot easier than creating a political movement that can unlock it. But I do believe there is a hunger in this country for a vision of the future that isn’t inherently fearful, that recaptures something of the optimism that was once synonymous with America. That gives me hope at a moment when we desperately need it.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. Sign up here!",

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go.\n\nUmair Irfan — a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox — has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nUmair, what’s NOAA and why is it so important?\n\nNOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tasked with developing weather forecasts for the United States, conducting oceanographic and atmospheric research, and developing long-term climate and weather models. It’s also in charge of fisheries and promoting commerce, particularly in the oceans, which means it does a lot of navigation and mapping work for shipping, and for offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nThere have been reports that as much as half of NOAA staff might be dismissed. What would everyday Americans lose if that happened?\n\nNOAA has a staff of about 12,000 people, most of them scientists and engineers. If you lost half of that, you’d lose a lot of people doing the research that informs our weather forecasts and our understanding of weather, as well as a lot of the data that industry players rely on for things like aviation and air travel. We’d also lose a lot of our emergency forecasting capability for extreme weather.\n\nNOAA is one of the reasons that air travel is so safe, and one of the reasons that we’ve seen fewer people dying in natural disasters in the US: It has done the work of putting satellites into space, of having scientific ships on the ocean, and aircraft that fly into hurricanes, and has used its decades of data gathering to develop excellent forecasting capability — and one that, through continual work, is improving all the time.\n\nIf we lose all those capabilities, we lose a lot of progress that has been made. Extreme weather will stay dangerous, however, and our ability to drive the risks involved with weather down over time will eventually diminish if we don’t continue to invest in that.\n\nNOAA obviously isn’t the only agency that’s facing cuts here. Do Americans gain anything by shrinking the government the way Trump has been?\n\nCurrent and former agency staffers and leaders I talked to say the cuts aren’t going to help agencies accomplish their missions, and will actually run counter to any goals of efficiency, because remaining employees will have to try to fulfill the functions of their fired colleagues in suboptimal ways.\n\nThat said, there’s always going to be room to optimize a big institution like the government. But we need to do so thoughtfully, stepping back and seeing what our needs are, and what our expectations are from government in general.\n\nSpecifically looking at an agency like NOAA, it’s about looking carefully at exactly how its core functions are being met, where they’re falling short, and where they can be augmented. So far, we really haven’t seen that level of exploration and interest in how these agencies function from the current administration.\n\nBig picture, what do you think Americans should learn from the case of NOAA?\n\nI think it’s easy to forget that the federal government is everywhere in our country — 80 percent of federal employees are not in DC.\n\nNOAA is one of those agencies that has a very far-flung footprint, because it has to do a lot of the local research and data gathering on site, and because its mission is to protect the whole country.\n\nAnd NOAA, like all agencies, is very closely linked to people’s lives in ways they may not expect. You may not have a NOAA app on your phone, but very likely the weather app you do have, and the forecast that you’re getting from your local TV meteorologist, are informed by NOAA’s satellites and data gathering.\n\nWhile there may be layers in between the products you consume and the government, it does provide the foundation for things we take for granted. If agencies like NOAA go away, we would definitely lose things we might not expect.\n\nRelated Elon Musk is coming for our weather service",

He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Justice Amy Coney Barrett as Trump arrives to address to a joint session of Congress in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on March 4, 2025. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThere are many lawsuits challenging allegedly illegal actions by the Trump administration — 132 of them as of March 21, according to the legal news site Just Security. That’s a lot to keep track of.\n\nTwo issues raised by some of these suits stand out, however, as Trump’s most blatant violations of the Constitution, and therefore as matters to pay particular attention to.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nOne is the question of whether Trump can simply cancel federal spending that is mandated by an act of Congress, an issue known as “impoundment.” As future Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote in a 1969 Justice Department memo, “it is in our view extremely difficult to formulate a constitutional theory to justify a refusal by the President to comply with a congressional directive to spend.”\n\nThe other issue is birthright citizenship. The Constitution is absolutely clear that anyone born in the United States and subject to its laws is a citizen, regardless of the immigration status of their parents. As one Reagan-appointed judge said of Trump’s attempt to strip citizenship from some Americans born in this country, “I’ve been on the bench for over four decades, I can’t remember another case where the question presented is as clear as this one is.”\n\nRelated The importance of staying angry at the Supreme Court\n\nSo it is reasonable to worry that a majority of the justices will simply do whatever a Republican administration wants them to do.\n\nThis is why the birthright citizenship and impoundment cases are such important bellwethers. No competent lawyer, and certainly no reasonable judge, could conclude that Trump’s actions in either case are lawful. There is no serious debate about what the Constitution says about either issue. If the Court rules in favor of Trump in either case, it’s hard to imagine the justices offering any meaningful pushback to anything Trump wants to do.\n\nFortunately, there are early signs that this won’t happen. On the impoundment issue, the Supreme Court recently rejected the Trump administration’s request to block a lower court order compelling the administration to make approximately $2 billion in payments to foreign aid organizations.\n\nThe vote was 5-4, and the Court’s decision likely turned on a careless mistake by Trump’s lawyers. Still, even a small defeat for Trump indicates that most of the justices aren’t so eager to bail out the leader of the Republican Party that they will jump on the first opportunity to do so.\n\nSimilarly, three cases raising the birthright citizenship issue recently landed on the Court’s shadow docket — emergency motions and similar matters decided, often very rapidly, outside of the Court’s normal schedule. So far, the Court’s only issued brief orders indicating that the justices won’t even start to consider the case until April 4 at the earliest, more than three weeks after the Trump administration asked them to intervene.\n\nThat’s not a definitive sign that birthright citizenship is safe, but the fact that the Court decided to wait three weeks before looking at lower court orders that protected birthright citizenship suggests that most of the justices don’t take the Trump administration’s arguments very seriously. If they had, they likely would have heard the cases sooner — in the foreign aid case where four justices sided with Trump, for example, the plaintiffs were given just two days to respond to the Justice Department’s arguments.\n\nThe legal arguments for impoundment are really, really bad\n\nTrump has claimed sweeping authority to cancel spending appropriated by Congress, including dismantling entire agencies like the US Agency for International Development (USAID). He also issued an executive order purporting to strip citizenship from many children born to undocumented mothers, or to parents who are temporarily present in the United States. Thus far, the courts have treated both of these actions with skepticism — as they should because they are clearly unconstitutional.\n\nRehnquist’s dismissive response to impoundment speaks for itself. There’s simply nothing in the Constitution that supports the argument that the president can impound funds that Congress commands him to spend. Indeed, the only language in the Constitution that seems to speak to this issue cuts against Trump. Among other things, the Constitution says that the president “shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” So the president has a duty to faithfully execute any law providing for federal spending.\n\nIt’s worth noting, moreover, that at least two of the Court’s Republicans have previously expressed skepticism about impoundment. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a 2013 opinion that “even the President does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend” funds appropriated by Congress. And Roberts wrote in a 1985 White House memo on impoundment that “no area seems more clearly the province of Congress than the power of the purse.” (Though it is worth noting that Roberts also suggested, in an attachment to that memo, that the president may have greater authority over spending relating to foreign policy.)\n\nThe legal arguments against birthright citizenship are even worse\n\nThe case for birthright citizenship is even more straightforward. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Someone is subject to US jurisdiction if the federal government can enforce its laws against that person. Undocumented immigrants and their children are obviously subject to US law, otherwise they could not be arrested or deported.\n\nAs the Supreme Court held in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), the “subject to the jurisdiction” exception to birthright citizenship is narrow and primarily applies to the children of “diplomatic representatives of a foreign state,” who have diplomatic immunity from US law, as well as children “born of alien enemies in hostile occupation.”\n\nAt least three courts have issued orders blocking Trump’s attack on birthright citizenship. In a brief asking the Supreme Court to narrow these orders, the Trump administration claims that the word “jurisdiction” actually means “allegiance.” So someone is not a citizen if they don’t owe “primary allegiance to the United States rather than to an ‘alien power.’”\n\nBut there are two reasons to doubt that even the Trump administration agrees with this argument. One is that Trump’s executive order only purports to strip citizenship from some children born to foreign nationals — a child of two lawful permanent residents, for example, remains a citizen. But if the Fourteenth Amendment doesn’t apply to anyone who owes “primary allegiance” to an “alien power,” that would mean that all children of foreign nationals should be stripped of their citizenship. The Constitution makes no distinctions based on whether a child’s parents are legally present in the United States, nor does it draw lines based on whether those parents are temporary or permanent residents.\n\nThe second reason is that, in its brief to the justices, the administration does not even ask the Court to fully reinstate Trump’s birthright citizenship order. Instead, it asks the Court to narrow the lower courts’ decisions so that they only apply to the plaintiffs in the specific lawsuits challenging that order. If Trump’s lawyers thought they had a winning argument, they almost certainly would have asked the justices to consider the merits of this case.\n\nThe question of whether lower court judges may issue what are known as “nationwide injunctions,” orders that suspend a federal policy in its entirety rather than permitting the plaintiffs in an individual case to ignore that policy, has lingered for quite some time. It’s these orders that are blocking Trump’s attack on birthright citizenship. Trump’s Justice Department pushed the Court to limit these nationwide injunctions during his first term, as did the Biden administration. But the Court has thus far allowed at least some of these broad orders to stand.\n\nWhile there are strong arguments against these nationwide injunctions, the Court has resisted efforts to limit them for years. It would be quite aberrant for the justices to suddenly decide to strip lower courts of their power to issue these nationwide orders in the birthright citizenship cases, where Trump’s arguments on the merits are frivolous.\n\nIn any event, the only outward sign the justices have given regarding their views on birthright citizenship suggests that Trump is going to lose. When the Justice Department asks the justices to stay a lower court’s decision, one of the justices typically asks the other party in the case to respond to that request by a short deadline — sometimes as little as a few days, and rarely more than a week. In this case, however, the Court gave the plaintiffs arguing in favor of birthright citizenship three full weeks to respond.\n\nSo long as the Court does nothing, the lower court orders blocking Trump’s attack on birthright citizenship remain in effect. And the justices are unlikely to do anything until they read the plaintiffs’ response. So, by stringing this case out for an additional three weeks, the justices ensured that Trump’s executive order wouldn’t go into effect any time soon.",

        "content": "Rachel Cohen:\n\nThere's two things that Paul Weiss agreed to do that are being widely reported on that are incredibly troubling.\n\nThe first is their agreement to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services to the Trump administration, including to support its Task Force to Combat Antisemitism. It is challenging to come on to TV and say that that's a bad thing, because, of course, we want to combat antisemitism.\n\nBut that task force played an integral role and will continue to play an integral role in the type of actions that we have seen very recently in terms of storming of Columbia University dorms, removing people who have legal status in this country and holding them in indefinite ICE detention for exercising free speech rights last year.\n\nSo that's item number one. Item number two is their willingness to collaborate with the Trump administration to examine their hiring policies related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. That's not just a go-forward commitment. They have also committed to working with the Trump administration to examine their past hiring practices, which is particularly troubling, because Paul Weiss until yesterday was a place that recruited very, very actively under a notion of diversity.\n\nThey targeted Black law students groups and convinced them that, if they came to Paul Weiss, they had a real chance at advancement. And so they are now taking those associates and throwing them under the bus. That troubled me in particular because there are 20 firms that have received an EEOC demand letter from the Trump administration related to their hiring practices and demanding personal information about applicants from 2019 on.\n\nThat information includes name, telephone number, e-mail address, and it focuses heavily on SEO Fellow applicants and 1L diversity scholar or diversity scholarship applicants broadly. Those are programs that existed across the industry until extremely recently and a strong pipeline for nonwhite associates to come into the industry.\n\nEEOC demand letters are not legally binding. You do not have to respond to them. And what prompted my ultimate resignation was that I am at one of the firms that received a demand letter, and they refuse to confirm that they will not be cooperating and providing that information.\n\nI cannot allow an employer that I continue to dedicate time and effort and energy to throw my colleagues of color under the bus.",

        "content": "CAIRO (AP) — Sudan’s military on Saturday consolidated its grip on the capital, retaking more key government buildings a day after it gained control of the Republican Palace from a notorious paramilitary group.\n\nBrig. Gen. Nabil Abdullah, a spokesperson for the Sudanese military, said troops expelled the Rapid Support Forces from the headquarters of the National Intelligence Service and Corinthia Hotel in central Khartoum.\n\nThe army also retook the headquarters of the Central Bank of Sudan and other government and educational buildings in the area, Abdullah said. Hundreds of RSF fighters were killed while trying to flee the capital city, he said.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the RSF.\n\nThe gain came a day after the military retook the Republican Palace, the prewar seat of the government, in a major symbolic victory for the Sudanese military in its nearly two years of war against the RSF.\n\nREAD MORE: Sudan’s military says it has retaken Republican Palace in Khartoum, seat of nation’s government\n\nA drone attack on the palace Friday believed to have been launched by the RSF killed two journalists and a driver with Sudanese state television, according to the ministry of information. Lt. Col. Hassan Ibrahim, from the military’s media office, was also killed in the attack, the military said.\n\nVolker Perthes, former UN envoy for Sudan, the latest military advances will force the RSF to withdraw to its stronghold in the western region of Darfur.\n\n“The army has gained an important and significant victory in Khartoum militarily and politically,” Perthes told The Associated Press, adding that the military will soon clear the capital and its surrounding areas from the RSF.\n\nBut the advances doesn’t mean the end of the war as the RSF holds territory in the western Darfur region and elsewhere. Perthes argued that the war will likely turn into an insurgency between the Darfur-based RSF and the military-led government in the capital.\n\n“The RSF will be largely restricted to Darfur … We will return to the early 2000s,” he said, in reference to the conflict between rebel groups and the Khartoum government, then led by former President Omar al-Bashir.\n\nAt the start of the war in April 2023, the RSF took over multiple government and military buildings in the capital including the Republican Palace, the headquarters of the state television and the besieged military’s headquarters, known as the General Command. It also occupied people’s houses and turned it into bases for their attacks against troops.\n\nIn recent months, the military took the lead in the fighting. It reclaimed much of Khartoum and its sister cities of Omdurman and Khartoum North, along with other cities elsewhere in the country. In late January, troops lifted the RSF siege on the General Command, paving the way to retake the palace less than two months later.\n\nThe military is now likely to try to retake the Khartoum International Airport, only some 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) southeast of the palace, which has been held by the RSF since the start of the war. Videos posted on social media Saturday purportedly showed soldiers on a road leading to the airport.\n\nThe war, which has wrecked the capital and other urban cities, has claimed the lives of more than 28,000 people, forced millions more to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll.\n\nThe fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Under threat from the Trump administration, Columbia University agreed to implement a host of policy changes Friday, including overhauling its rules for protests and conducting an immediate review of its Middle Eastern studies department.\n\nThe changes, detailed in a letter sent by the university’s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, came one week after the Trump administration ordered the Ivy League school to enact those and other reforms or lose all federal funding, an ultimatum widely criticized in academia as an attack on academic freedom.\n\nWATCH: Using funding to ‘force concessions’ threatens institutions, Princeton president says\n\nIn her letter, Armstrong said the university would immediately appoint a senior vice provost to conduct a thorough review of the portfolio of its regional studies programs, “starting immediately with the Middle East.”\n\nColumbia will also revamp its long-standing disciplinary process and bar protests inside academic buildings. Students will not be permitted to wear face masks on campus “for the purposes of concealing one’s identity.” An exception would be made for people wearing them for health reasons.\n\nIn an effort to expand “intellectual diversity” within the university, Columbia will also appoint new faculty members to its Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies department. It will also adopt a new definition of antisemitism and expand programming in its Tel Aviv Center, a research hub based in Israel.\n\nThe policy changes were largely in line with demands made on the university by the Trump administration, which pulled $400 million in research grants and other federal funding, and had threatened to cut more, over the university’s handling of protests against Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.\n\nThe White House has labeled the protests antisemitic, a label rejected by those who participated in the student-led demonstrations.\n\nA message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for the Education Department.\n\nAs a “precondition” for restoring funding, federal officials demanded that the university to place its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies Department under “academic receivership for a minimum of five years.”\n\nThey also told the university to ban masks on campus, adopt a new definition of antisemitism, abolish its current process for disciplining students and deliver a plan to ”reform undergraduate admissions, international recruiting, and graduate admissions practices.”\n\nHistorians had described the order as an unprecedented intrusion on university rights long treated by the Supreme Court as an extension of the First Amendment.\n\nOn Friday, freedom of speech advocates immediately decried Columbia’s decision to acquiesce.\n\n“A sad day for Columbia and for our democracy,” Jameel Jaffer, the director of Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said in a social media post.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The British government on Saturday ordered an investigation into the country’s “energy resilience” after an electrical substation fire shut Heathrow Airport for almost a day and raised concerns about the U.K.’s ability to withstand disasters or attacks on critical infrastructure.\n\nWhile Heathrow Airport said it was “fully operational” on Saturday, thousands of passengers remained stuck, and airlines warned that severe disruption will last for days as they scramble to relocate planes and crews and get travelers to their destinations.\n\nREAD MORE: London’s Heathrow slowly resumes flights after a fire shut down Europe’s busiest airport\n\nInconvenienced passengers, angry airlines and concerned politicians all want answers about how one seemingly accidental fire could shut down Europe’s busiest air hub.\n\n“This is a huge embarrassment for Heathrow airport. It’s a huge embarrassment for the country that a fire in one electricity substation can have such a devastating effect,” said Toby Harris, a Labour Party politician who heads the National Preparedness Commission, a group that campaigns to improve resilience.\n\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband said he’d asked the National Energy System Operator, which oversees U.K. gas and electricity networks, to “urgently investigate” the fire, “to understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.”\n\nIt is expected to report initial findings within six weeks.\n\n“The government is determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow,” Miliband said.\n\nStalled journeys\n\nMore than 1,300 flights were canceled and some 200,000 people stranded Friday after an overnight fire at a substation 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away from the airport cut power to Heathrow, and to more than 60,000 properties.\n\nHeathrow said Saturday it had “added flights to today’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers.” British Airways, Heathrow’s biggest airline, said it expected to operate about 85 percent of its 600 scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday.\n\nWhile many passengers managed to resume stalled journeys, others remained in limbo.\n\nLaura Fritschie from Kansas City was on vacation with her family in Ireland when she learned that her father had died. On Saturday she was stranded at Heathrow after her BA flight to Chicago was canceled at the last minute.\n\n“I’m very frustrated,” she said. “This was my first big vacation with my kids since my husband died, and … now this. So I just want to go home.”\n\nShutdown points to a broader problem\n\nResidents in west London described hearing a large explosion and then seeing a fireball and clouds of smoke when the blaze ripped through the substation. The fire was brought under control after seven hours, but the airport was shut for almost 18 hours. A handful of flights took off and landed late Friday.\n\nPolice said they do not consider the fire suspicious, and the London Fire Brigade said its investigation would focus on the electrical distribution equipment at the substation.\n\nStill, the huge impact of the fire left authorities facing questions about Britain’s creaking infrastructure, much of which has been privatized since the 1980s. The center-left Labour government has vowed to improve the U.K.’s delay-plagued railways, its aged water system and — especially — its energy network, promising to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy independence through investment in wind and other renewable power sources.\n\n“The last 40, 50 years we’ve tried to make services more efficient,” said Harris. “We’ve stripped out redundancy, we’ve simplified processes. We’ve moved towards a sort of ‘just in time’ economy. There is an element where you have to make sure you’re available for ‘just in case.’ You have to plan for things going wrong.”\n\n‘Clear planning failure’\n\nHeathrow is one of the world’s busiest airports for international travel, and saw 83.9 million passengers last year.\n\nChief executive Thomas Woldbye said he was “proud” of the way airport and airline staff had responded.\n\n“The airport didn’t shut for days. We shut for hours,” he told the BBC.\n\nWoldbye said Heathrow’s backup power supply, designed for emergencies, worked as expected, but it wasn’t enough to run the whole airport, which uses as much energy as a small city.\n\n“That’s how most airports operate,” said Woldbye, who insisted “the same would happen in other airports” faced with a similar blaze.\n\nBut Willie Walsh, who heads aviation trade organization IATA, said the episode “begs some serious questions.”\n\n“How is it that critical infrastructure – of national and global importance – is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative? If that is the case, as it seems, then it is a clear planning failure by the airport,” he said.\n\nWalsh said “Heathrow has very little incentive to improve” because airlines, not the airport, have to pay the cost of looking after disrupted passengers.\n\n‘No back-up plan’\n\nFriday’s disruption was one of the most serious since the 2010 eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which shut Europe’s airspace for days.\n\nPassengers on about 120 flights were in the air when Friday’s closure was announced and found themselves landing in different cities, and even different countries.\n\nMark Doherty and his wife were halfway across the Atlantic when the inflight map showed their flight from New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport to Heathrow was turning around.\n\n“I was like, you’re joking,” Doherty said before the pilot told passengers they were heading back to New York.\n\nDoherty called the situation “typical England — got no back-up plan for something happens like this. There’s no contingency plan.”\n\nAssociated Press journalist Kwiyeon Ha at Heathrow Airport contributed to this report.",

        "content": "BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Israel struck Lebanon on Saturday in retaliation for rockets targeting Israel, killing two, including a child, in the heaviest exchange of fire since its ceasefire with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah almost four months ago.\n\nThe rockets fired from Lebanon were the second ones launched since December and again sparked concern about whether the ceasefire would hold. In a statement, Hezbollah denied being responsible for the latest attack, saying it was committed to the truce.\n\nWATCH: After delays in ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, Israel renews attacks on Gaza\n\nIsrael had said it would respond “severely” to the early Saturday attack targeting northern Israel. Israel’s army said the intercepted rockets targeted the Israeli town of Metula. An Israeli official said six rockets were fired and three crossed into Israeli territory and were intercepted.\n\nThe official said Israel could not confirm the identity of the group that fired the rockets. The official said the military struck targets across southern Lebanon.\n\nLebanon’s health ministry said the strike in the southern village of Touline killed two people and wounded eight others.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister’s office said it instructed the army to act forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon, adding: “Israel will not allow any harm to its citizens and sovereignty.” Israel’s army said it struck dozens of rocket launchers and a command center where Hezbollah was operating.\n\nIn a statement, Lebanon’s Prime Minister Nawaf Salam asked the Lebanese military to take all necessary measures in the south but said the country did not want to return to war.\n\nHezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group’s senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.\n\nIsraeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under a ceasefire struck on Nov. 27. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18.\n\nBut Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon, across from communities in northern Israel. It has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.\n\nLebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw from the country.\n\nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes pound Gaza\n\nThe strikes came a day after Israel said it would carry out operations in Gaza “with increasing intensity” until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds — 24 of whom are believed to be alive.\n\nIsraeli strikes on Friday night killed at least nine people, including three children, in a house in Gaza City, according to Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the bodies.\n\n“Rubble and glass started falling on us,” said Sameh al-Mashharawi, who lost his brother in the attack. He mourned with his young nephew Samir al-Mashharawi, whose parents and siblings were killed. The 12-year-old, his head and wrists bandaged, sat in the back of a truck and cried.\n\nIsrael’s military said Friday its forces were planning fresh assaults into three neighborhoods west of Gaza City and issued warnings on social media for Palestinians to evacuate the areas.\n\nREAD MORE: Israel orders soldiers deeper into Gaza, vowing to hold more land unless Hamas releases hostages\n\nAround 600 Palestinians have been killed since Israel relaunched the war earlier this week. Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel, and humanitarian aid to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas over ceasefire negotiations.\n\nThe international community has condemned the resumed attacks.\n\nThe initial 2023 attack by Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.\n\nIsrael’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nShurafa reported from Deir Al-Balah, Gaza.

A lot of us feel traumatized and embarrassed, grief-ridden by what's happening in the country.\n\nBut a couple of things have to be said. First, the town halls are not representative of where the country is. Obviously, people who show up at a town hall are unrepresentative. And if you look where the country is, you have got to have anecdotes, like a town hall. Oh, maybe that's something. But then you have got to have data.\n\nAnd so far, the polls show Trump is slipping a little, but not a lot. And so we haven't yet seen the kind of collapse the town halls kind of suggest.\n\nThe second thing is, what does fight mean in this context? Like, we all want to fight back. But what does fight mean? Does fight mean going on social media and saying something all your followers agree with? Like, that doesn't sound like fighting to me. It may make you feel good, but that doesn't sound like fighting.\n\nAnd so, to me, fighting is probably the wrong word in a democracy. Persuasion is the right word. And I do think there are persuadable Trump voters, and those are the people you have to care about. He's not going to worry if people in Indivisible don't like him.\n\nIf you can persuade Trump voters that he is incompetent. Don't go after moral outrage. Say, he just doesn't know what he's doing, and he's causing you serious harm, and specify what the harm is. He's taking away this medical care. He's taking away that. He's taking away that. You can't get your passport renewed. You can't get your VA benefits.\n\nThe history shows you have got to have very specific things that they are losing, that people are losing, that Trump supporters are losing that will get them to change their mind. Just screaming, marching, resistance, the stuff that was tried in 2017, don't really think that works.",

He subsequently experienced several respiratory crises that landed him in critical condition, though he has since stabilized.\n\nIn another development, the Vatican announced that Francis would appear on Sunday morning to bless faithful from his 10th floor suite at the hospital. While Francis released an audio message on March 6 and the Vatican distributed a photo of him March 16, Sunday’s blessing will be the first live appearance since Francis was admitted on Feb. 14 for what has become the longest hospitalization of his 12-year papacy.\n\nWATCH: Hospitalized Pope Francis releases audio message thanking supporters for their prayers\n\nThe Argentine pope, who has chronic lung disease, is prone to respiratory problems in winter and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted after a bout of bronchitis worsened.\n\nDoctors first diagnosed a complex bacterial, viral and fungal respiratory tract infection and soon thereafter, pneumonia in both lungs. Blood tests showed signs of anemia, low blood platelets and the onset of kidney failure, all of which later resolved after two blood transfusions.\n\nThe most serious setbacks began on Feb. 28, when Francis experienced an acute coughing fit and inhaled vomit, requiring he use a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask to help him breathe. He suffered two more respiratory crises in the following days, which required doctors manually aspirate the mucus, at which point he began sleeping with the ventilation mask at night to help his lungs clear the accumulation of fluids.\n\nAt no point did he lose consciousness, and doctors reported he was alert and cooperative.\n\nOver the past two weeks, he has stabilized and registered slight improvements, the Vatican press office has reported. He no longer needs to wear the ventilation mask at night, and is cutting back his reliance on high flows of supplemental oxygen during the day.",

        "content": "George Foreman became the heavyweight champion of the world in his 20s, only to lose his belt to Muhammad Ali in perhaps the most memorable fight in boxing history.\n\nA full 20 years later in 1994, the 45-year-old Foreman became the oldest man to win the heavyweight championship, throwing one perfect combination to steal Michael Moorer’s title in an epic upset.\n\nFew fighters ever had more big moments than Big George Foreman — and even after he finally left the ring, he was only getting started.\n\nThe fearsome heavyweight, who lost the “Rumble in the Jungle” to Ali before his inspiring second act as a surprising champion and a successful businessman, died Friday night. Foreman was 76.\n\nForeman’s family announced his death on social media, not saying how or where he died.\n\n“A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father and a proud grand- and great-grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility and purpose,” his family wrote. “A humanitarian, an Olympian and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected. A force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name— for his family.”\n\nA native Texan, Foreman began his boxing career as an Olympic gold medalist who inspired fear and awe as he climbed to the peak of the heavyweight division by stopping Joe Frazier in 1973. His formidable aura evaporated only a year later when Ali pulled off one of the most audacious victories in boxing history in Zaire, baiting and taunting Foreman into losing his belt.\n\nWATCH: ‘The Fire Inside’ chronicles boxer Claressa Shields’ journey to Olympic gold and beyond\n\nForeman left the sport a few years later, but returned after a 10-year absence and a self-described religious awakening.\n\nThe middle-aged fighter then pulled off one of the most spectacular knockouts in boxing history, flooring Moorer — 19 years his junior — with a surgical right hand and claiming Moorer’s two heavyweight belts. Foreman’s 20 years is easily the longest gap between heavyweight title reigns.\n\n“His contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten,” former heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, said on X, formerly Twitter, as he expressed his condolences.\n\nForeman’s transformation into an inspirational figure was complete, and he fought only four more times — finishing 76-5 with 68 knockouts — before moving onto his next career as a genial businessman, pitchman and occasional actor.\n\nOutside the ring, he was best known as the face of the George Foreman Grill, which launched in the same year as his victory over Moorer. The simple cooking machine sold more than 100 million units and made him much wealthier than his sport ever did.\n\n“George was a great friend to not only myself, but to my entire family,” Top Rank president Bob Arum said. “We’ve lost a family member and are absolutely devastated.”\n\nIn the first chapter of his boxing career, Foreman was nothing like the smiling grandfather who hawked his grills on television to great success.\n\nForeman dabbled in petty crime while growing up in Houston’s Fifth Ward, but changed his life through boxing. He made the U.S. Olympic team in 1968 and won gold in Mexico City as a teenager, stopping a 29-year-old opponent in a star-making performance.\n\nForeman rose to the pinnacle of the pro game over the next five years, but was also perceived as an aloof, unfriendly athlete, both through his demeanor and through the skewed racial lenses of the time.\n\nJim Lampley, the veteran boxing broadcaster who worked alongside Foreman for many years at HBO, told The Associated Press on Friday night that Foreman’s initial demeanor was an attempt by his camp to emulate Sonny Liston, the glowering heavyweight champ of the 1960s.\n\n“At some point somewhere along the way, he realized that wasn’t him,” Lampley said.\n\nForeman stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell’s iconic call: “Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!”\n\nForeman defended his belt against Ken Norton before accepting the fight with Ali in the now-immortal bout staged in Africa by promoter Don King. Ali put on a tactical masterclass against Foreman, showing off the “rope-a-dope” strategy that frustrated and infuriated the champion. Foreman was eventually knocked down for the first time in his career, and the fight was stopped in the eighth round.\n\nForeman told the BBC in 2014 that he took the fight almost out of charity to Ali, who he suspected to be broke.\n\n“I said I was going to go out there and kill him, and people said, ‘Please, don’t say you’re going to kill Muhammad,’” Foreman said. “So I said, ‘OK, I’ll just beat him down to the ground.’ That’s how easy I thought the fight would be.”\n\nExhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade preaching and working with kids in Houston after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s with a plan to defy time through frequent ring appearances, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a surprisingly competitive title fight in 1991.\n\nThree years later, Foreman got in the ring with Moorer in Las Vegas, more for his celebrity than for his perceived ability to beat Moorer. The champion appeared to win the first nine rounds rather comfortably, with Foreman unable to land his slower punches. But Foreman came alive in the 10th, hurting Moorer before slipping in the short right hand that sent Moorer to the canvas in earth-shaking fashion.\n\nLampley, who was calling the fight, named his upcoming autobiography — which includes a prologue about Foreman — after his famous call of that moment: “It Happened!”\n\nForeman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. Much of the world soon knew Foreman as both a lovable friend and a ferocious fighter.\n\n“He started performing as this pitchman, this product pitchman with the big, ever-present giant grin on his face,” Lampley recalled. “When I was working with him, people would say, ‘George is a big clown.’ And I would say, ‘Well, you can call him a clown, but he’s actually a genius. He may be the greatest genius I’ve ever met.’ And people would say, ‘Well, genius, what do you mean?’ I’d say, ‘Well, check the bank account. If that isn’t proof enough, I don’t know what is.’ So, he was a genius. He was a human genius.”\n\nForeman briefly starred in a sitcom called “George” in the 1990s, and he even appeared on the reality singing competition “The Masked Singer” in 2022. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023.\n\nForeman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman.\n\n“Legendary boxing champion, life-changing preacher, husband, father, grand- and great-grandfather and the best friend you could have,” WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman wrote on social media. “His memory is now eternal, may Big George rest in peace.”\n\nAP Sports Writer Brian Mahoney contributed to this report.",

(AP) — At least three people were killed and 14 others were injured in a mass shooting at a park in the desert city of Las Cruces, New Mexico, police said Saturday.\n\nGunshot victims ranging in age from 16 to 36 were sent to all three local hospitals, as well as to University Medical Center of El Paso, the regional trauma center, according to police and hospital officials. Of six patients who arrived at Memorial Medical Center in Las Cruces by ambulance and private car, five were sent to El Paso, said marketing and communications director Andrew Cummins.\n\nThose who died were two 19-year-old men and a 16-year-old boy, police said. Their names and those of other victims were not yet being released.\n\nWATCH: In ‘Run, Hide, Fight,’ student journalists report on how gun violence affects youth\n\nPolice were asking for bystanders to share videos and other tips as they continued to seek a suspect or suspects in the attack, which occurred at about 10 p.m. on Friday in the city’s Young Park, a music and recreation venue. A news conference was scheduled for later Saturday.\n\nIn a post to Instagram on Saturday, Las Cruces City Councilor and Mayor Pro Tem Johana Bencomo expressed grief at the tragedy.\n\n“Part of me wanted to write that this is something you never really think this is going to happen in your city, but that actually feels deeply untrue,” she wrote. “Honestly now days a tragedy like this feels like a nightmare just waiting to come true at any possible moment, yet also always praying and hoping it never will.”\n\nLas Cruces sits on the edge of the Chihuahuan Desert along the Rio Grande River in southern New Mexico, about 41 miles (66 kilometers) north of the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nThe Las Cruces Police Department said they were being assisted in their investigation by New Mexico State Police, the Dona Ana County Sheriff’s Office, the FBI and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nThe department was still on scene Saturday and the area around the park was closed to traffic, according to local media reports.",

Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”\n\nTrump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\n\nHe added: “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nPBS News, in partnership with DPAN, is offering simultaneous translation of our special coverage in American Sign Language. Watch that livestream below.\n\n\n\nThe executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”\n\nFrigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happened in 40 years — and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities.\n\nREAD MORE: Your schedule of events for Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nAt the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.\n\nA cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 things that have changed since Trump’s 1st inauguration\n\nTrump began the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.\n\n“Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\n\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\n\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\n\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\n\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\n\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\n\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\n\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\n\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\n\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\n\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\n\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\n\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\n\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

(AP) — Kitty Dukakis, the wife of former Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, who spoke openly about her struggles with depression and addiction, has died. She was 88.\n\nDukakis died on Friday night surrounded by her family, her son, John Dukakis, said on Saturday by telephone. She fought to make the world better, “sharing her vulnerabilities to help others face theirs,” her family said in a statement.\n\n“She was loving, feisty and fun, and had a keen sensitivity to people from all walks of life,” the family said. “She and our dad, Michael Dukakis, shared an enviable partnership for over 60 years and loved each other deeply.”\n\nREAD MORE: Former Oklahoma governor and senator David Boren dies at 83\n\nDukakis won high marks as a political campaigner during her husband’s 1988 presidential efforts, stumping tirelessly for him. She was called a key influence in his decision to seek the presidency.\n\nShe even figured in the opening question of a 1988 presidential debate, when her husband was asked: “Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?” Dukakis said he would not, and his unemotional response was widely criticized.\n\nEarlier in the campaign, in 1987, Dukakis revealed she had overcome a 26-year addiction to amphetamines five years earlier after receiving treatment. She said she began taking diet pills at age 19.\n\nHer husband made anti-drug efforts a major issue and she became prominent in the effort to educate youngsters against the perils of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nBut a few months after Michael Dukakis lost the election to Vice President George H.W. Bush, Kitty Dukakis entered a 60-day treatment program for alcoholism. Several months later she suffered a relapse and was hospitalized after drinking rubbing alcohol.\n\nIn her 1990 autobiography, “Now You Know,” she blamed her mother for much of her alcohol and drug addiction and a long history of low self-esteem. In 2006, she wrote another book, “Shock,” which credits the electroconvulsive therapy she began in 2001 for relieving the depression she had suffered for years. The treatment, she wrote, “opened a new reality for me.”\n\nCurrent Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey called Dukakis “a force for good in public life and behind the scenes,” a leader in the effort to ensure that the Holocaust is never forgotten, and an advocate for children, women and refugees.\n\n“She spoke courageously about her struggles with substance use disorder and mental health, which serves as an inspiration to us all to break down stigma and seek help,” Healey said in a statement.\n\nDukakis used her personal pain to help others, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said in a statement on social media on Saturday.\n\n“Her legacy will live on in the policies she helped shape and the people she inspired to speak their own truths,” Campbell said.\n\nDukakis broke ground by speaking openly about her struggles and championed support for the homeless and political refugees, said Maria Ivanova, director of Northeastern University’s Policy School, which hosts the Kitty and Michael Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy.\n\n“Kitty Dukakis brought honesty, compassion, and strength to public life,” Ivanova said in a statement. “Her legacy is one of service, resilience, and truth-telling.”\n\nKitty Dukakis inspired many to engage in activism and was a “deeply devoted spiritual companion” to her husband, center Director Ted Landsmark said in a statement.\n\n“They have been truly effective change-makers on behalf of those in need of care and support,” he said.\n\nMichael Dukakis served as a distinguished professor of political science at the university. He has retired, but returns to campus for events and student consultations, Landsmark said.\n\nDukakis and her future husband met while attending high school in Brookline, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb. He was dull and frugal; she was dramatic and fancy. He is Greek Orthodox; she was Jewish.\n\nKitty Dukakis, who was divorced and had a 3-year-old son, married Michael Dukakis in 1963, and they had two children, Andrea and Kara.\n\nDukakis, whose late father, Harry Ellis Dickson, was associate conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, earned degrees in modern dance and broadcasting.\n\nAfter the presidential election, in 1989, Bush appointed her to be a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.\n\nShe earlier served on the President’s Commission on the Holocaust in 1979 and on the board of directors of the Refugee Policy Group. She has also been a member of the Task Force on Cambodian Children.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Dukakis and her husband divided their time between Massachusetts and California, where she was a social worker and he was a professor for part of the year at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nFormer Associated Press writer Lisa Flam contributed to this report.",

        "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s executive order singling out transgender service members wasn’t a shock to Lt. Cmdr. Geirid Morgan and her family. Nor was the Pentagon’s accompanying policy to remove trans troops from the force, released about a month after Trump’s order.\n\n“The first feelings I had really were just, concerned for my fellow transgender service members, concerned for their families, concerned for the service members that service under them,” she said.\n\nMorgan has spent 14 years moving up the ranks in the U.S. Navy. Long-serving trans service members, like Morgan, are now plaintiffs in legal challenges against Trump’s ban. To the trans troops suing the government — among them, an Air Force staff sergeant with 16 years of service, a Navy commander with 19, an Army sergeant first class with 20 — the ban is poised not only to harm them, but also drain experience and expertise from the military.\n\nTrump’s latest attempt at a trans military ban has been in court this week. A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the ban was likely unconstitutional and “soaked in animus” and could not move forward. The government responded Friday asking the judge to dissolve the injunction before it goes into effect.\n\nEarlier in the week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X that “we are appealing this decision, and we will win.”\n\nTrans service members who spoke with PBS News days before the judge’s ruling, and shared their views in a personal capacity and not on behalf of the Defense Department, said they worry about the uncertainty of what’s next.\n\n“I hope there isn’t a perception from anyone that we’re going to be voluntarily separated from service and then sort of just go on and live our best lives right now, because that’s becoming more and more difficult for a trans person in America,” Morgan said.\n\nTrump made targeting trans people one of the cornerstones of his re-election campaign, crescendoing to a multi-million dollar campaign ad blitz weeks before November’s vote. There were ads with anti-trans rhetoric against a group of people that makes up less than 1 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nIn remarks from the Oval Office last week, Trump said he told Republicans to focus on trans rights in the ramp-up to Election Day.\n\n“I said, ‘Don’t bring that subject up because there is no election right now. But about a week before the election, bring it up,’” he said.\n\nA majority of Americans — 58 percent — favor trans people openly serving the military, according to a Gallup poll conducted in January as Trump began his second term. But that support has fallen in recent years. In 2019, 71 percent of Americans supported trans troops. The decline is largely driven by Republicans, the poll found. Some seven in 10 Republicans now oppose the idea.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump picked Hegseth, who once said being trans “creates complications and differences” in the military, to lead the Defense Department. Once confirmed, the former Fox News Channel host put the president’s “anti-woke” agenda at the center of his reorganization of the armed forces.\n\nPointing to Trump’s 2017 attempt to ban trans troops from the military, Morgan’s wife, Christina, said they’d hoped the new effort, “was ‘talk’ and not ‘do’ because that happened a lot in the first administration.” But what was surprising this time was the language, she said, “how insulting it was.”\n\nThe 1,000-word executive order Trump issued in January never uses the word “transgender,” which means having a gender identity that differs from the sex one was assigned at birth. It used specific framing to argue that the country’s military has been “afflicted with radical gender ideology.”\n\nCivil rights and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups have rebuked the ban in court, saying it violates trans people’s equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n\n“It’s a character assassination based on nothing.”\n\nThe language in the Trump administration’s policy rollout also demeans trans people as “dishonest and selfish and undisciplined,” said Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights at GLAD Law.\n\n“It’s a character assassination based on nothing,” said Levi, who’s a lead attorney in the case that received the nationwide preliminary injunction. “And animus alone can never justify targeting a group and punishing them without justification other than hostility.”\n\nIn his executive order, the president suggested that being trans and a soldier were incompatible, that being trans “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle.”\n\nThe follow-up Pentagon memo claimed service members or recruits who have a history of, or show signs of, gender dysphoria, the distress some feel when their bodies don’t align with their gender, are “incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service.”\n\n“Military service is a life of service. It’s a sacrifice,” Morgan said. “A lot of time, a lot of energy, a lot of performance put into my ability to make lieutenant commander.”\n\nAs the courts and the administration respond, Morgan thinks about how all of that could be ending.\n\nThe legal back-and-forth\n\nThe January night that Trump signed the executive order, Morgan waited to read it until after she and Christina got the kids to bed. She didn’t want to absorb its contents and meaning alone.\n\nWhen they finally nestled down, Christina read it three times before Morgan got through it once. Then they spent hours talking through how the order would affect their future.\n\nA ban wouldn’t just stop Morgan’s career in its tracks. It would severely disrupt her life and that of her family. It would sever the pathway to her pension and retirement, benefits she and her wife were depending on. The couple built their financial planning around a lifelong career in the military, Christina said.\n\n“It just feels ruinous,” Christina said. “We have no idea how financially secure we’ll be this time next year.”\n\nAt a March 12 hearing in Washington, D.C., District Judge Ana Reyes had pressing questions.\n\nShe asked Justice Department attorneys if they had read some of the studies that formed the basis for the Pentagon’s justification for the ban. They indicated they hadn’t.\n\nReyes upbraided the attorneys for being unprepared and ordered a 30-minute break for them to read the material.\n\nWhen court resumed, the judge walked through each study’s findings. She was skeptical of how the data led to the conclusions behind the ban, including the idea that openly serving trans service members affected military readiness or unit cohesion. Some of the studies the memo cited, she added, actually supported keeping trans people in the military.\n\nThe attorney defending the policy was in some cases unable to answer the judge’s questions directly.\n\nThe following week, Reyes blocked enforcement of the ban. In her written opinion, the judge acknowledged that she had a lengthy text — a 79-page opinion — “but its premise is simple.”\n\n“In the self-evident truth that ‘all people are created equal,’ all means all. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less,” she wrote.\n\nThe judge also drew attention to the ban’s language, calling it “unabashedly demeaning” and that the resulting policy “stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.” Reyes also wrote that there’s no evidence that Trump or Hegseth consulted with military leaders before issuing the order or its policy.\n\nDOJ attorneys have argued in court filings and hearings that the commander-in-chief is “constitutionally charged” with setting U.S. military policy and officials in the armed forces should have the ability to make decisions about service members without court interference.\n\nReyes agreed that the president has the power, even obligation, to ensure military readiness. But the judge pointed to times in history when, “Leaders have used concern for military readiness to deny marginalized persons.”\n\n“It’s just an echo of a shameful past.”\n\n“First minorities, then women in combat, then gays,” she wrote.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson said in an email to PBS News that Reyes’ injunction “is the latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people who overwhelmingly voted to elect President Trump. The Department of Justice has vigorously defended President Trump’s executive actions, including the Defending Women Executive Order, and will continue to do so.”\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson said the Defense Department doesn’t respond to questions about ongoing litigation.\n\nSasha Buchert, a senior attorney for Lambda Legal, one of the groups representing Morgan and other trans troops in their legal challenge against the ban, said the arguments the administration has raised about readiness and unit cohesion are repeating the “same hypotheticals and fearmongering,” she said. The Defense Department, she added, is still cleaning up the dishonorable discharges that some LGBTQ+ service members received under “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”\n\n“This is just something we’ve repeated over and over and over again,” Buchert said. “It’s just an echo of a shameful past.”\n\nLevi, who described rollout of the ban as “chaotic and unpredictable,” said that implementing a policy in this manner “is contrary to military operations and destabilizing to the force.”\n\n“It’s confusing to command. It’s confusing to troops. And of course it’s confusing to the transgender service members,” the attorney said. “These are folks who are used to following orders, who are committed to following orders, and whose lives have really been dedicated to understanding rules and carrying out a mission.”\n\nServing through the policy shifts\n\nAfter witnessing the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in 2011, Kris Moore spent the next few years gradually coming out as trans to family and friends. Eventually, the sailor told his commanding officer, too, soon after starting hormone treatments in 2015 for his medical transition.\n\nThe crew was preparing to deploy to the Middle East. And Moore wanted to get ahead of any rumors because “the sailors are going to see a change in me very quickly, like whether it’s the voice change or stubble coming in,” he said. “On a ship, you’ve got to trust everyone around you. The person next to you has to know that you’ve got their back.”\n\nA rumor, he said, would complicate the deployment, and at a time he could face a discharge for being trans – President Barack Obama wouldn’t officially end the ban on trans service members until the following year.\n\nWith the support of his captain, Moore stood before a much bigger audience — his fellow officers and chiefs on the ship.\n\nHe told everyone that he was raised as a girl. He said he was taking testosterone to transition to living as a man. He was willing to explain to anyone what being transgender meant.\n\n“At the end of the day, we have a job to do,” he remembered telling the crew, “and I just want to put this out there and just be open and honest with all of you guys.”\n\nHe asked if anyone had questions and the room grew quiet.\n\n“Are you happy?” one chief engineer blurted out.\n\nThat caught Moore off-guard. He wasn’t sure if it was a legitimate question. The engineer repeated it: She wanted to know if Moore, and his partner at the time, were happy.\n\nMoore said yes.\n\n“Then who gives a s*** what anyone else thinks?” she said.\n\nIt was the aggressive show of support that Moore needed. When the wardroom was dismissed, every single person came over and shook Moore’s hand or hugged him.\n\n“I was just, like, waterworks,” he said.\n\nMoore later followed the processes to change his name and gender marker on government documents.\n\nThe support he’s received from commanding officers and peers hasn’t wavered.\n\n\n\nCommander Emily Shilling, a decorated Navy pilot with over 60 combat missions and high-risk work as a test pilot, spoke with PBS News’ Lisa Desjardins about her legal challenge to Trump’s executive order. Watch the segment in the player above.\n\nWhen Trump tweeted in 2017 that trans people would not be allowed to serve “in any capacity,” Moore’s ship had just returned to port. Internet access on the ship is weak when out at sea, “so I was completely oblivious to what was going on in the world,” Moore said.\n\nAt lunchtime, a voice piped in over the ship’s announcement system. Moore was being summoned to the commanding officer’s cabin. Something was wrong – meals are “sacred time” for service members to unwind, he said.\n\nThe command master chief, who was also in the commanding officer’s cabin, had a worried look as she told Moore to come in and have a seat. She didn’t say much more.\n\nMoore asked what happened. His captain unmuted the TV and pointed to the ticker scrolling at the bottom.\n\nMoore couldn’t fully process the news, but he remembered how the captain responded: This doesn’t matter. This is not policy. This is a tweet. This is not how the military chain of command runs.\n\nThe White House released a policy a month later, prompting multiple legal challenges and reaching the Supreme Court. When President Joe Biden took office in 2021, he reversed the policy. Yet the pendulum is swinging back again, with Trump trying the ban in his second term.\n\nThe shifts in policy have put trans service members in a precarious position. Doors opened after being shut for so long and then suddenly closed again.\n\n“I’m scared,” said Moore, who is not a plaintiff in either lawsuit against the ban. He’s been in the Navy since he was 18. He’s now 38, a few years from reaching retirement.\n\n“I had all these dreams that are, one by one, starting to get crushed because I won’t be able to finish my 20 [active-duty] years or continue to serve,” he said.\n\nAs the Trump administration seeks to lift the court’s ruling, Morgan is trying to figure out where her next assignment will be.\n\nShe had orders to report to a duty station in Maryland but they were canceled on March 11, about two weeks after the Pentagon policy was released, her attorney confirmed to PBS News.\n\nThere’s been so much waiting. Waiting on the executive order. Waiting on the Defense Department policy. Waiting on the Navy’s policy. Waiting on the official separation date. Waiting on a court ruling and the next one after that.\n\n“We are just focused on putting our uniforms on, going to work every day, doing our jobs the best that we can do until we can’t do them anymore,” she said.\n\nRight now, her uniform waits in her closet at home.\n\nPBS News’ Tim McPhillips contributed to this story.",

        "title": "Some Serious Russian Maritime Mischief Seems to Be Afoot",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Our friends, the International Consortium for Investigative Journalists, have taken their act to sea these days, tracking some serious Russian maritime mischief in and around the Mediterranean—specifically, running guns to Libya and ferrying various types of contraband to various other places on ships of dubious provenance.\n\nThe documents show how commercial vessels—known as a ghost fleet—employed a range of tricks to avoid detection as they shipped Russian equipment to Libya. They also highlight growing European concerns about Russia’s influence in the country, which officials believed was part of a broader strategy by Moscow to project power in the Mediterranean and several African countries.\n\nAfter Isik posted the photographs, Interpol prepared a report on the Barbaros that found the vessel had manipulated its Automatic Identification System (AIS), the device that transmits information about a ship’s location, in an attempt to conceal its position. The report also found the ship had changed its name three times and had registered itself under the flag of a different country at least 10 times since 2013. The report assessed that the ship “may be carrying firearms destined for Libya” and recommended that authorities closely monitor it.\n\nThree name changes? Ten different flags? There are protected witnesses with less complicated CVs.\n\nRussia’s ghost fleet has enriched Moscow by helping it evade Western sanctions on its oil sales, according to the United States and European Union. Whether carrying oil or arms, these vessels often manipulate their AIS to avoid detection. In dozens of reports produced in 2024, European authorities tracked how vessels turned off their AIS when passing near the Syrian port of Tartus, where Russia maintains a naval base. Sometimes, these ships also spoofed their AIS data to appear in a different place than where they actually were. In another case, according to a report included in the leaked documents, a vessel suspected of shipping arms from Syria to Libya manipulated its location to appear offshore the Lebanese capital of Beirut—but mistakenly transmitted its location as on dry land at the airport, rather than the maritime port.\n\nThe Russians were a lot less clever when they were a bunch of broke Communists.\n\nTheir economy is a den of thieves. Their military is in shambles. They are ruled by a strongman who doesn’t even pretend to be anything but a kleptocrat any more and who seems perpetually to be one step ahead of a panicked flight to Bimini. Yet, despite all that, they still have the wherewithal to run an operation like this, and to sublet an American administration ... twice.\n\nAccording to a leaked briefing document, the head of the EU naval mission was advised in June that the number of Russian flights to Libya in the first half of 2024 matched the total for all of 2023, and that the mission had observed “a formalization of the Russian presence” over the past year. The document also described an increase of Russian military shipments to the country. “A Russian naval presence in the Mediterranean is a fact and we see regular navy visits to [Libya],” the briefing document stated. Mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company that had been operating in Libya since at least 2018, were supplanted in 2024 by the Africa Corps, a unit under the direct control of Russia’s military, the leaked documents reported.\n\nThe Africa Corps. Tobruk. This all seems familiar somehow.\n\nLibya represents “an immediate security issue for Europe” because of Russia’s presence there and the African nation’s role as a migration route, according to the internal summary following the meeting with the German envoy. “It’s a testament to Western strategic negligence,” said El Gomati, the Sadeq Institute director. “Russia has been constructing a military node that is not only capable of destabilizing Libya but also threatens European security 400 miles from NATO’s shores.”\n\nNegligence is doing a lot of work at having a kind meaning in that sentence.",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer Just Shredded His Own Credibility",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Chuck Schumer is done like dinner. His announcement on Thursday that he is surrendering to the House’s stopgap vivisection of what vital programs still have survived this administration’s bloodletting shreds what’s left of his credibility as a leader in the Senate and as a national leader in the Democratic party. It doesn’t matter whether he can muster enough votes to stay minority leader—and given what he did on Thursday, he’s likely to be the leader of a Democratic Senate minority for a long time—it no longer matters. As the months go on, and as the president and his ketamine-fueled button man continue their assault on the federal government, now with the complicity of both houses of Congress, Schumer is going to look increasingly silly and irrelevant. Absent an outright mutiny on the Senate floor, that complicity will gain his party ... nothing.\n\nSchumer certainly orchestrated his surrender well—a speech to the Senate, a press conference, and an op-ed in The New York Times. He never can say he wasn’t allowed to make his case. From Politico:\n\nHis points were two-fold: First, a shutdown would play into Trump and Musk’s hands, he argued, allowing them to continue with their slash-and-burn campaign overdrive. His second argument was more political—and in keeping with his long history as a leading strategist counseling his party to pay heed to the concerns of America’s middle class above all else. “For Donald Trump, a shutdown would be a gift,” Schumer said. “It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.\n\n“Right now, Donald Trump owns the chaos in the government. He owns the chaos in the stock market,” he added. “In a shutdown, we would be busy fighting with Republicans over which agencies to reopen, which to keep closed, instead of debating the damage Donald Trump’s agenda is causing the American people.”\n\nThe obvious rejoinder is to point out that, for all practical purposes, the administration is shutting down the government anyway, and that by walking away from the fight and giving away what little leverage he has, Schumer has foreclosed any real political opportunity that might have presented itself by making the president “own” the chaos in government. Quite simply, Schumer now “owns” a part of the chaos going forward. The only question is how many Democrats want to partner with him in this new acquisition.\n\nA substantial portion of the Democratic caucus in the House feels hosed. They unanimously lined up against the plan—unafraid of the perils that so spooked Schumer about a shutdown. I think the Democratic members of the House recognized the obvious—that there is no palpable political advantage to be gained in helping the current administration. And if the most recent Quinnipiac poll is to be believed, 53 percent of respondents already blamed the Republicans for any shutdown before Schumer hit the silk. This is because those people looked at what the Republicans already were doing.\n\nMoreover, Schumer’s unilateral surrender completely ignores the fact that the administration is being rendered into sticks and splinters every time it finds itself in front of a federal court. Most recently, we had federal district judge William Alsup’s almost unprecedented ass-kicking in which he angrily ruled that thousands of laid-off federal workers be offered their old jobs back forthwith. From Politico:\n\nAlsup issued his ruling in a lawsuit brought by federal employee unions. He lashed out at the Justice Department over its handling of the case, saying he believes that Trump administration lawyers were hiding the facts about who directed the mass firings. “You will not bring the people in here to be cross-examined. You’re afraid to do so because you know cross examination would reveal the truth,” the judge said to a DOJ attorney during a hearing Thursday. “I tend to doubt that you’re telling me the truth. … I’m tired of seeing you stonewall on trying to get at the truth. ... It is sad, a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie,” Alsup said.\n\nAnother federal district judge, this one in Maryland, ruled the same way on the same day. From The Washington Post:\n\n[James] Bredar, the judge, had signaled at a recent hearing he was likely to agree, noting to a Justice Department attorney that the case was not about whether the government can terminate people, but if those terminations were conducted legally. At one point, Bredar quoted the Silicon Valley mantra embraced by DOGE head Musk: “Move fast and break things.”\n\n\"Move fast? Fine,” Bredar said. “Break things? If that involves breaking the law, then that becomes problematic.”\n\nSchumer’s capitulation takes a lot of the political power out of how staunchly the federal courts have stood against the onslaught of the MAGA crew. Sooner or later, the administration is going to act in obvious contempt of court and, possibly, that will go up to the Supreme Court, which would have the opportunity to revisit its horrendous presidential-immunity decision from last July. This is only one of the righteous fights on which Chuck Schumer now has taken a pass. It’s time for someone to buy him a gold watch, thank him for his service, and shuffle him off the stage. He is not a wartime consigliere.\n\nRelated Story EPA Chief Lee Zeldin Is on a Mission to Let the Polluters Pollute\n\n\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Another rough couple of days for the administration in the nation’s courts. On Tuesday, an appeals court upheld common sense, always a losing issue for this bunch. This comes after a judge in another court told the DOGE and Pony Show to, well, pony up, because he said so, that’s why.\n\nOne of the most audacious acts of this administration is the president’s delusion that he can simply sign away the 14th Amendment’s plain guarantee of birthright citizenship with a stroke of his mighty pen. (Why do they laugh at his mighty pen?) However, Judge David Barron of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was having none of it. He points out that the administration’s crack legal team didn’t even address this fundamental issue in its brief.\n\nThe Government expressly declines to make any developed argument that it is likely to succeed on appeal in showing that the Executive Order is either constitutional or compliant with 8 U.S.C. § 1401. Nor does the Government contest that, for more than a century, persons in the two categories that the Executive Order seeks to prevent from being recognized as United States citizens have been so recognized. Instead, the Government contends that it can make the requisite showing for a stay of the preliminary injunction even without developing an argument to us that the Executive Order is lawful and even though the enforcement of the Executive Order would dramatically break with the Executive Branch’s longstanding legal position and thereby disrupt longstanding governmental practices.\n\nMeanwhile, another judge, District Judge Christopher Cooper, has told DOGE to open its books so we can all know what the hell is going on. From Politico:\n\nU.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper said the vast and “unprecedented” authority of DOGE, formally known as the U.S. Digital Service, combined with its “unusual secrecy” warrant the urgent release of its internal documents under the Freedom of Information Act. ... “The authority exercised by USDS across the federal government and the dramatic cuts it has apparently made with no congressional input appear to be unprecedented,” Cooper wrote in a 37-page opinion.\n\n“The rapid pace of [DOGE’s] actions, in turn, requires the quick release of information about its structure and activities,” Cooper wrote. “That is especially so given the secrecy with which DOGE has operated.” Cooper leaned heavily on news reports suggesting that Musk’s operation had led to the firing of tens of thousands of government employees, the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, a government-wide deferred resignation program and widespread access to sensitive government databases for relative outsiders.\n\nThis is how, in all legal propriety, you call something a rogue agency and tell it to stand and deliver the reasons why it should continue to operate as one.\n\n“Congress needs the requested information in a timely fashion to use it effectively. The electorate also requires the expeditious production and publication of this information,” Cooper said. “Voters may seek to influence congressional representatives to take action responsive to USDS at any point along the road. And ‘[t]he dissemination of information’ sought by CREW would contribute ‘to an informed electorate capable of developing knowledgeable opinions and sharing those knowledgeable opinions with their elected leaders.’ ”\n\nIt’s becoming quite plain that the president’s hail of executive orders is little more than a rain of shadows. Most of them are so deeply unserious that the only people taking them as anything more than empty gestures are the members of the president’s cult in Congress and some of the more credulous members of the media. Once again, the real crunch will come when he runs out of appeals and tries to ignore the final judgments of the courts. That will be the true reckoning.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "The prosecution of El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago wrapped up in Manhattan, but not before things got lively again. The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\n\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\n\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom. Under the law, a representative for the media or even a member of the media is allowed to petition in open court for the opportunity to stay. Trump’s non-lawyer entourage was allowed to stay.\n\nMonday’s “non-lawyer entourage” included Bernie Kerik and Alan Dershowitz. I guess we’re down to the U-Team now.",

        "title": "In the War Room with Steve Bannon",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nDonald Trump won the 2020 election,” Steve Bannon pronounces. “Of that there is not even a question.\"\n\nObviously you expect me not to agree with you, I say. “Of course I expect you not to agree with me,” he says. “And I’m also not looking for you to agree with me. And I also don’t give a fuck who in the mainstream media agrees or disagrees with me.”\n\nAnd so off we go—about this and about Covid (the Bannon view: “It’s 100 percent a bioweapon—fucking not even a question”) and about vaccines (“I would never in ten million years get this vaccine,” Bannon says, and asks if I would; I simply hand him my vax card, which he looks at with apparent amazement: “I’ve never . . .”) and about what I view—but naturally Bannon doesn’t—as his incessant anti-Semitic dog-whistling. At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\n\nOr misinformation, I say.\n\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\n\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\n\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\n\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\n\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\n\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\n\n“That will be impossible.”\n\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\n\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\n\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\n\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\n\n\n\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\n\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\n\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\n\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\n\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\n\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\n\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\n\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\n\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\n\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\n\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\n\n\n\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\n\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\n\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\n\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\n\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\n\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\n\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\n\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\n\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\n\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\n\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\n\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\n\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\n\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\n\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\n\nDid you cry?\n\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\n\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\n\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\n\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\n\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\n\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\n\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\n\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\n\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\n\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\n\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\n\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\n\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\n\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\n\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\n\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\n\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\n\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\n\n\n\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\n\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\n\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\n\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\n\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\n\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\n\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\n\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\n\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\n\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\n\nYou must have advocated for it.\n\n“No, never.”\n\nReally?\n\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\n\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\n\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\n\nWhy do you think he did it?\n\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\n\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\n\n\n\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\n\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\n\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\n\n\n\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\n\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\n\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\n\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\n\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\n\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\n\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\n\nOkay.\n\n“This is not an existential moment.”\n\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\n\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\n\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\n\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\n\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\n\n“Are they in the book?”\n\nSome of them.\n\n“I don’t remember.”\n\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\n\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\n\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\n\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\n\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\n\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\n\nI agree that he has not.\n\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\n\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\n\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\n\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\n\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\n\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\n\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\n\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\n\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\n\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\n\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\n\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\n\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\n\n“Okay. Okay.”\n\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\n\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\n\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\n\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\n\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\n\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\n\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\n\nBut that’s a tragedy.\n\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\n\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\n\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\n\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\n\n\n\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\n\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\n\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\n\nHis answer comes back immediately.\n\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\n\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.",

        "content": "There are other courthouses in other places. They’re not in Washington. They’re the repair shops of the law. They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\n\n\n\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\n\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\n\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\n\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\n\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\n\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\n\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\n\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial",

But there does seem to be a general brawl shaping up between the executive and judicial branches. The president went out of his way to pick a fight on Wednesday by calling for the impeachment of federal district judge James Boasberg, who ordered a two-week pause in the administration’s human-trafficking operation. The president took to his social-media site to explain his reasoning in the sane and lucid manner to which we’ve become accustomed.\n\nThis Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn’t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn’t WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn’t WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY. I’m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!! WE DON’T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\n\nLincolnesque, I tells ya.\n\nFor some reason, this spasm set off the Bat Signal in Roberts’s brain, so he did something he almost never has done. He politely told the president to pound sand. From Politico:\n\n“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,” Roberts said Tuesday in a rare and brief statement issued just hours after Trump publicly joined demands by his supporters to remove judges he called “crooked.”\n\nBoy, the chief really threw the handbill at him there.\n\nI’m not sure this even qualifies as “pushback.” That will come, if it ever does, when these multiple abuses of office come before Roberts and his colleagues and when, after that, the president ignores a Supreme Court ruling that goes against him. Until then, I guess, we take what we can get. You will notice that nowhere in this post do I use the word institutionalist. Fool me once, chief...",

But let us take a look at how the charm offensive was going this weekend.\n\nOur own Logan Airport apparently has been turned into an immigration black site, complete with enhanced interrogation. Dozens of stories have emerged of the human costs on the ongoing DOGE and Pony Show—graduate schools rescinding acceptances because federal funding for programs has been cut, Social Security recipients being denied benefits because somebody somewhere declared them dead, pediatric brain-cancer patients being abandoned mid-treatment, court orders now being routinely ignored to the point where tin-pot Central American presidents are mocking them. The president is now threatening to ignore the lawful pardons granted by former president Biden, basing this latest power grab on a theory even more laughable than the one he used to justify his reverse human trafficking to El Salvador. Arlington National Cemetery and the U.S. Army scrubs its website records of Black and Hispanic and other minority military members, including the 442nd Infantry, the famous Nisei unit in World War II that was recruited from Japanese Americans out of the detention camps where they were being held.

        "content": "It may be the distraction everybody says it is. It may be a shot across the bow from a corrupt president against investigators who might choose to inconvenience him. It could be both of those. But the release Tuesday of nearly 70,000 pages of heretofore classified documents related to the assassination of John F. Kennedy is an early Easter basket full of very interesting accounts of the covert doings of the CIA in the 1960s. And whatever the motives behind their release may be, it is all information that we should have had years ago. The good people at the National Security Archive have sorted through much of the massive information dump and filtered out some very tasty nuggets. For example:\n\nThere is a “family jewels” memo to William Colby dated June 1, 1973, at the height of the revelations regarding the CIA’s history of international dirty tricks. This one begins with a genuinely hilarious spasm of bureaucratic linguistic gymnastics.\n\nFollowing our recent conversation, I have searched my memory and Mr. McCone’s files for examples of activities which to hostile observers or to someone without complete knowledge and with a special kind of motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities exceeding CIA’s charter.\n\nA special kind of motivation like, say, telling the country what was being done in its name. Like, say, burglarizing a foreign embassy in Washington.\n\nAs a result of a developing relationship with Philippe de Vosjoli, the SDECE representative in Washington, and also as a result of certain information conveyed by Anatole Golitson, James Angleton, with the approval of Dick Helms, agreed to mount a counterespionage operation against the French Embassy in Washington. This involved breaking and entering and the removal of documents from the French Consulate.\n\nAlthough certain activities never got beyond the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples of such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation. One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice crops in both Cuba and North Vietnam. A second involved a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nuclear installations. Outside the United States Government, General Eisenhower was briefed on such planning. A third, which assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by Angleton and Helms for a greatly increased intelligence collection against foreign installation in this country.\n\n“Which assumes a new significance today”? Oh, please, do go on.\n\nFinally, and this will reflect my Middle Western Protestant upbringing, McCone’s dealings with the Vatican, including Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters.\n\nHoly Borgias, Batman. My eyebrows are on the ceiling.\n\nThere’s also a 40-page document detailing CIA meddling in elections all over the globe, as well as with a rising revolutionary movement in Yemen.\n\nAnd there’s an oblique mention that’s going to ring all kinds of bells among Oliver Stone fans.\n\nAlso in the afternoon, the Deputy Director (Plans) read to the Panel a paper on Operation Mongoose which the Director had used earlier in the day for briefing the President. This paper was used on the instruction of the Director. The Panel asked questions about agency activity in Cuba, all of which were answered with the exception of one having to do with the role of the Attorney General. This query was raised by Mr. [Gordon] Gray who recognized and gracefully accepted the fact that he not answered directly.\n\nMr. Gray, who had been the National Security Advisor during the Eisenhower administration, thus gets a gold star for being incurious.\n\nAgain, there’s very likely nothing in here that will tell us much about what happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963. But there’s a great deal to be said for setting the scene, and the American intelligence community was a cynical, occasionally criminal, gang. The more we know about that, the better, and the more evidence we have that JFK had the right idea in 1962 when the Bay of Pigs came a cropper. A thousand pieces, and scattered to the winds.\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Yes, folks. He’s nutty as the Christmas fruitcake. From The New York Times:\n\nInstead of culling birds when the infection is discovered, farmers “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it,” Mr. Kennedy said recently on Fox News. He has repeated the idea in other interviews on the channel.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, your latest dispatch from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAnd he’s not alone.\n\nMr. Kennedy does not have jurisdiction over farms. But Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, also has voiced support for the notion. “There are some farmers that are out there that are willing to really try this on a pilot as we build the safe perimeter around them to see if there is a way forward with immunity,” Ms. Rollins told Fox News last month.\n\nImmunologists are aghast.\n\n“That’s a really terrible idea, for any one of a number of reasons,” said Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas.\n\nShe has a gift for understatement.\n\nSince January 2022, there have been more than 1,600 outbreaks reported on farms and backyard flocks, occurring in every state. More than 166 million birds have been affected. Every infection is another opportunity for the virus, called H5N1, to evolve into a more virulent form. Geneticists have been tracking its mutations closely; so far, the virus has not developed the ability to spread among people. But if H5N1 were to be allowed to run through a flock of five million birds, “that’s literally five million chances for that virus to replicate or to mutate,” Dr. Hansen said.\n\nEvidently, Mr. Secretary thinks that he’s Walter Reed in Cuba, except using chickens and not human volunteers. The super-immune chickens will Tell Us Something.\n\nMr. Kennedy has suggested that a subset of poultry might be naturally immune to bird flu. But chickens and turkeys lack the genes needed to resist the virus, experts said. “The way we raise birds now, there’s not a lot of genetic variability,” Dr. Hansen said. “They’re all the same bird, basically.” Public health regulations would forbid the very few birds that might survive an infection from being sold. In any event, those birds might only be protected against the current version of H5N1, not others that emerge as the virus continues to evolve. “The biology and the immunology doesn’t work that way,” said Dr. Keith Poulsen, the director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.\n\nThere's a lot wrong with how we factory-raise our food, especially the animate foodstuffs. But it can only be solved through vigorous government regulation—which, as we know, gives President Musk the vapors, so much so that he's already screwed the pooch on this very thing, forcing the Department of Agriculture to bail out both him and the president he theoretically serves. So, for the moment, there ain't nobody here but us chickens.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Something interesting is happening in the chambers of the Supreme Court. The Nine Wise Souls are preparing to hear the case of Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board v. Drummond and St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School v. Drummond. At issue is a decision by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that denied public funding for a Catholic virtual charter school on the grounds that all the state’s charter schools must by law be public schools and that funding religious charter schools is unconstitutional. In January, the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal in the last week of April. At the time, Justice Amy Coney Barrett declined to participate in that decision. She did so without explanation.\n\nBarrett, who handed Donald Trump a conservative 6–3 supermajority when she was confirmed to the court, won’t be on the bench to hear it. She recused herself, leaving no explanation for sitting out what could be the most significant legal decision to affect schools in decades. Observers believe the cause is her friendship with Garnett, who was an early legal adviser to the school. Nicole and her husband Richard Garnett, also a Notre Dame law professor, are both faculty fellows with the university’s Religious Liberty Clinic, which represents St Isidore. In a deep irony, the longtime friendship between the two women, forged in Catholic faith and a conservative approach to jurisprudence, now threatens to tip the scales away from a cause Garnett has spent her career defending.\n\nSimply put, with Barrett’s recusal, it is now possible that the Court will split, 4–4, in which case the decision of the Oklahoma supremes would stand and the funding would be denied. This would come as an immense shock to the conservative Catholic legal community centered these days at Notre Dame.\n\nAt Notre Dame, Garnett and Barrett overlapped as faculty members for roughly 17 years. “She became a lifelong friend,” Garnett said. “She lived around the corner from us and we raised our kids together.” And when Trump introduced the mother of seven to the nation, Garnett was seated in the Rose Garden along with senators, White House officials and other dignitaries.\n\nGiven their intersecting interests, it’s very likely that school vouchers—a top conservative priority to provide students with public money to spend at non-public schools—came up in conversation. Until 2017, Barrett served as a trustee at Trinity School at Greenlawn, a private classical Christian academy in South Bend, Indiana, that participates in the state’s voucher program. Garnett, meanwhile, was honing legal arguments in favor of expanding such programs. Before joining the faculty at Notre Dame, she worked as a staff attorney for the Institute for Justice, a right-leaning law firm that has led efforts to open school choice programs to religious schools.\n\nWhen one recalls Justice Clarence Thomas’s arrogant refusal to recuse himself from hearing cases involving the January 6 insurrectionists despite his wife’s involvement in some of the surrounding events, Barrett’s decision to recuse herself here looks like high principle. It will look even more like that if one of the four remaining conservatives on the court jumps ship and creates the 4–4 deadlock. Madam Justice Barrett is becoming interesting.",

        "content": "Ordinarily, I stay away from the continuing forensic analysis of What the Fck Happened? The election was four months ago. The consequences are drowning us, and it’s hard enough keeping up with the fresh hell unleashed every day to go back and discuss how we all got here. However, in The New York Times on Tuesday, pollster named David Shor, and eventually they came around to a conclusion to which Shor had come from his polling. It is one of the most depressing pieces of dialogue I’ve read in a while.\n\nKLEIN: One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. This is something I was told by top Biden strategists. I don’t see democracy on here or Jan. 6 and the stability of the system. Did you test those, as well?\n\nSHOR: We did. But we did a survey where we just asked people: What’s more important right now—preserving America’s institutions or delivering change that improves people’s lives? It was 78 to 18: delivering change that improves people’s lives. One of the hardest things about being a political consultant over the last eight years is that every day Trump does terrible things—things that I think are objectively awful and scary and that [expletive] me off. Things he says, like: I’m going to prosecute my enemies. Then we do a bunch of tests, and voters really don’t want to hear about it from us. I think Trump would do better if he didn’t say those things, for sure. But voters want politicians to talk about concrete ways that they are going to improve people’s lives.\n\nAll my life, it was a given that the more democratic a system was, the better off the people would be. Hell, that was the stated reason for almost all our military and intelligence misadventures of the past 80 years. Both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson proposed economic aid for Vietnam even as they deepened American military involvement in the hopes of stimulating some sort of democratic government in Indochina. (See also: The Quiet American.) It was the stated reason for the grandiose Middle East fantasies of the PNAC crowd during the aughts. When was it that the country stopped believing that? When did we decide, en masse, that democracy and “improving people’s lives” contradicted each other? Personally, I trace it back to Ronald Reagan’s first inaugural address, which supercharged the conservative dogma that “government” was somehow an alien entity and not the creation of a commonwealth in which we all had a stake and to which we had an obligation.\n\nRegulars here at the shebeen know that I am fond of Daniel Webster’s caution against simplifying government.\n\nNothing is more deceptive or more dangerous than the pretense of a desire to simplify government. The simplest governments are despotisms; the next simplest, limited monarchies; but all republics, all governments of law, must impose numerous limitations and qualifications of authority, and give many positive and many qualified rights.\n\nThe stake we all have in a political commonwealth, and to which we have obligations, can be found in those words. In the chat between Klein and Shor can be found the death of that commonwealth. Everything else is a symptom.",

        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where Momma’s in the kitchen, and she ain’t got no shoes.\n\nIt was a target-rich environment out there this week, and we begin with the winner of this week’s FAFO Medal—Minnesota Republican state senator Justin Eichorn. He achieved some fame in wing-nut circles by proposing that the state’s legislature declare “Trump Derangement Syndrome” a legitimate form of mental illness. Chuffed by his newfound eminence among the goobers, Eichorn apparently decided to make a phone call. From the AP:\n\nGOP Sen. Justin Eichorn, 40, of Grand Rapids, was arrested in Bloomington on Monday in an undercover operation targeting commercial sex involving juveniles. Investigators had placed multiple ads online offering sex for money, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Court documents indicate Eichorn started sending messages in response to the ads March 11. “I saw your post and (sic) chance you are still available tonight?” one asked, according to an FBI affidavit, while a later message asked, “What’s a guy gota do to get with the hottest girl online tonight.”\n\nThe Aristocrats!\n\nEichorn exchanged messages with an undercover officer posing as a 17-year-old girl over several days, asking about pricing for various sex acts and requesting a picture, the affidavit said. They arranged a meet-up on Monday, where he arrived to find police ready to arrest him. Officers seized two cellphones, a condom, and $129 in cash, it said.\n\nPoor guy. Seems like all he wanted was to FA and all that happened was that he FO in a big way. What’s left for the guy? “FI” and “FUM,” I guess.\n\nWe move along to the Commonwealth (God save it!), where The Boston Globe’s Spotlight unit locked onto some serious police misconduct in the area of confidential informants in the city of New Bedford.\n\nWithin the department, Jorge Santos was a rising star. Barely 30, he was part of a specialized squad—the marine unit—tasked with overseeing a stretch of the city’s busy waterfront. Brash and aggressive, he won raves for his work ethic from supervisors, his impressive arrest totals recounted in the local media. In policing’s vernacular, he was a worker, the kind of hard-charging officer who delivered the stats that made bosses look good.\n\nAmong many in the department’s rank-and-file, however, Santos had a far different reputation. He’d long been known as a loose cannon, a reckless officer who cut corners and maybe more. A colleague in the marine unit had warned police higher-ups that Santos was a liability. Officer Mark Raposo told supervisors he would no longer back up Santos on calls because he didn’t want to put himself in legal jeopardy.\n\nThe story goes on to describe a bizarre scene aboard a fishing boat in which a New Bedford police officer, responding to a disturbance call on the boat, found himself in the middle of a scrum involving the boat’s crew and another member of the New Bedford PD.\n\nNow, Raposo was getting radioed by dispatch and ordered to sort out what exactly was happening aboard the Little Tootie.\n\nScreaming. Fighting. Shouts about drugs and money. And in the middle of the scrum stood his colleague, Santos, mumbling about a “confidential informant.”\n\nRaposo stood there, befuddled. What was his colleague—off-duty, armed, alone, and without a warrant or any paperwork—doing here in the middle of the night, tussling with some out-of-town fishermen? This wasn’t some clandestine police operation, Raposo thought. It was a robbery, a “drug rip,” in Raposo’s words. The perpetrator was a fellow cop. And the supposed confidential informant behind it? Probably a fabrication, Raposo figured.\n\nOh, lovely. Overuse of confidential informants has resulted in serious abuse of the concept of confidential informants. (According to Spotlight’s examination of what records they could squeeze out of the state’s various police departments, nine out of every ten drug busts in the Commonwealth—God save it!—depended vitally on the use of CIs. The other installments in the Spotlight series describe how the rise of New Bedford’s current police chief was fueled by his making busts based on what he said was information from CIs, and an account by a former CI about his terrifying life in Kafkaland in a Massachusetts prison.\n\n“ ‘Confidential informant’ is really a misnomer, because they’re not providing just confidential information,” said Lance Block, a Florida-based attorney who has helped craft legislation aimed at establishing protections for informants. “I call them ‘civilian operatives’ ... because they’re doing what police officers do.” He questions the whole premise. “We don’t use civilians to direct traffic at a football game, and yet we’re going to use civilians to go undercover and potentially put their life at risk?” he adds. “It just makes no sense.”\n\nWe hop on our pirogue and choogle on down to LOO-si-yana where Governor Greg Landry is letting his bon temps rouler in the state’s death chambers. From Bolts:\n\n\n\nSince taking office as governor in January 2024, Landry has signed a flurry of bills functionally abolishing parole going forward, granting police greater immunity, and moving all 17-year-olds into the adult criminal system, even those accused of minor crimes. But the symbolic heart of Landry’s “tough on crime” agenda has been his drive to resume state-sponsored killings. In 2018, Landry had criticized then-Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, for not doing enough to jumpstart executions. Once governor, he did not mince words: “Capital punishment is lawful, and we intend to fulfill our legal duty to resume it,” he told legislators at the start of a special legislative session on crime that he called as one of his first official acts as governor.\n\nThe session was a blitzkrieg: Over the nine days it met, the Republican-controlled legislature reauthorized execution by electrocution and legalized nitrogen hypoxia. It also passed a “secrecy statute” that shields execution procedures from scrutiny, rendering them easier to carry out and harder to challenge. In February, Landry announced that the state had formalized a protocol for nitrogen killings. Three executions were quickly scheduled back to back in March. Then, nearly as quickly, one was taken off the calendar after it became clear that the prisoner in question hadn’t exhausted his appeals. Another execution scheduled for this month didn’t happen after the 81-year-old who was slated to be killed died of natural causes.\n\nThe piece centers on one death-row inmate named Chris Duncan and alleges that he may have been framed by a couple doctors who claimed to specialize in “forensic odontology”—i.e., bite marks—but whose work had been steadily discredited by other specialists in that field. (A video emerged that seemed to show one of these doctors using a mold of Duncan’s teeth to inflict the bite marks on the corpse of the victim, a young girl.) This occurred as bite-mark evidence itself was losing its credibility in court.\n\nIt wasn’t just Hayne and West, though: Bite mark analysis itself was being debunked. As of last year, [Journalist Radley] Balko told me, “every single scientific body to evaluate the merit of bite mark analysis has said there’s no scientific merit to it whatsoever.” During a 2012 deposition, even West changed his tune, saying, “I no longer believe in bite mark analysis. I don’t think it should be used in court,” though he would later continue to defend the practice in media interviews. Today, it routinely gets dismissed as junk science. “This bite mark stuff—it’s, I think the legal term is total bullshit,” Stafford Smith said.\n\nDuncan’s effort to secure a new trial is still hanging fire. All that’s changed is that Landry is now governor and he’s dedicated himself to limiting the appeals process that kept Duncan alive long enough to expose the two forensic “experts” as quacks. Bad enough that so many politicians are so determined to kill people, but there’s no reason to be quite so gleeful about it.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Outdoor Café Specialist Friedman of the Algarve brings us the tale of a state legislature grown exhausted by an excess of democracy. From Tulsa Public Radio:\n\nSenate Bill 1027 would limit the number of initiative petition signatures that could come from high-population areas and would require anyone collecting signatures to be an Oklahoma registered voter. The measure is headed to the state House after the full Senate approved it on Tuesday with a party-line vote of 36-8. The bill would require that no more than 10% of signatures on an initiative petition could come from a county where 400,000 or more people reside. That would affect only residents of Tulsa and Oklahoma counties by capping the total share of signatures from those two counties at 20%.\n\nNaturally, you don’t want signatures collected where the most people live because math is hard. That those two counties happen to be the state’s most heavily Democratic ones is purely coincidental, I am sure.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.",

        "title": "Shall We See How the President’s Brilliant Trade War Strategies Are Affecting the Folks?",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done, and where they sing “Amazing Grace” all the way to the Swiss bank.\n\nLet’s take a brief look around the country to see how the president’s brilliant trade-war strategies are affecting the Folks. From CNBC:\n\nCaleb Ragland, a soybean farmer in Magnolia, Ky., voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024. Now, however, he has to navigate a tariff minefield at a time when the sector is already facing major headwinds. … As pressures mount in the industry as a result of tariffs imposed by the second Trump administration—as well as retaliatory levies from other countries—he’s worried about the longevity of his business. “My sons potentially could be the 10th generation if they’re able to farm,” Ragland, who is also the president of the American Soybean Association, told CNBC. “And when you have policies that are completely out of our control—that they manipulate our prices 20%, 30%, and on the flip side, our costs go up–we won’t be able to stay in business.” This isn’t the first time farmers have had to deal with new tariffs. Back in Trump’s first term, the trade war with China in 2018—a time when Ragland said the agricultural economy was “in a much better place than it is right now”—cost the U.S. agriculture industry more than $27 billion, and soybeans made up virtually 71% of annualized losses.\n\nI would point out that Mr. Ragland works in an market that got brained by the president’s trade policies in 2018, the last time the president was in office. And yet he voted for him twice since then. I have given up trying to understand this way of thinking. If you can’t rely on simple self-interest as an explanation for voting patterns, then political science might as well be alchemy or necromancy.\n\nIf the trade war has a front line, it probably runs through places like Point Roberts in Washington State. From Global News:\n\nPoint Roberts is a community of about 1,100 people and it is located just south of Tsawwassen. However, it relies on British Columbia for much of its commerce. “Half of us here are dual citizens, including me—Canadian and American, half of us,” Point Roberts resident Brian Calder and former president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce told Global News. “So there’s 500 of us here that have very strong ties to Canada. And I get that they’re upset and angry that their sovereignty is being threatened for no good reason whatsoever. And the animosity and the apprehension, the anger is very, very detrimental to Point Roberts. They stay away.”\n\n“It’s absolutely devastating for Point Roberts businesses, those that are left because we lost half our businesses in the COVID 20 months lockdown, they couldn’t carry themselves through that long period of time,” Calder said. “And of those left, now, they’re just barely hanging on.”\n\nNone of this, of course, is necessary. It is all so much gratuitous negligence. This is the first international conflict playing out completely in the deteriorating mind of an American president. Which doesn’t mean there are no casualties.\n\nCalder said Point Roberts residents consider British Columbians and Canadians brothers and sisters, not just neighbors. “We didn’t do anything wrong. They didn’t do anything wrong. Why are we in this mess? It’s absolutely stupid and it’s not productive and it’s not necessary or needed. And no one wins.” Calder said tensions are high on both sides of the border but some residents have expressed that they are facing hostility when they cross into Canada, which is part of the reason for the bumper sticker. \"We’ve had people actually try and push people over in traffic,” he said. “We’ve had people confronted down at the drug store in Tsawwassen. ‘What are you doing here? Get back to your own (country)’. We don’t have a drug store.”\n\nWe move along to Utah, which was a pioneer in adopting mail-in voting and which remained a reliably conservative state anyway. Now, however, out of what appears to be pure spite, the state legislature seems determined to blow up that proud history. From Bolts:\n\nLannie Chapman, the county clerk who runs this office and serves as the top elections official in Utah’s most populous county, eyed the artifact and considered how different, and difficult, her work would be if the state ever went back to voting the way it did when the old booth was in use. “No, thank you,” she said at the prospect, laughing. “It’s fun for a photo op, but that’s about it.”\n\nThe hypothetical may be a bit too close for comfort. A few miles up the road from Chapman’s Salt Lake City office, at the Utah State Capitol, lawmakers have just put the finishing touches on a major voting-system overhaul: House Bill 300, which passed the Republican-controlled legislature March 6, would end universal vote-by-mail in Utah. It’s a landmark reform that would close an era in which Utah occupied a unique place in the national patchwork of election rules: Since 2019, it’s been the only reliably red state in the country to automatically mail a ballot to every registered voter. HB 300 would instead require any Utah voter to proactively request a mail ballot. It would also impose additional restrictions on how they must return these ballots, for instance by ending the grace period for when they must be delivered to election offices by postal workers. “We are known for safe, secure, and convenient access, and this is going to make everything a lot more difficult,” Chapman said. “It’s not fair to our voters.”\n\nThis is simply conservative fanaticism run amok. Voting officials in Utah from both parties swear by the current vote-by-mail system, and the people seem to like it a great deal. But as Bolts learned, the people carrying the water for these changes are doing so for people far from the Beehive State.\n\nBolts put the question to state Representative Jefferson Burton, the Republican lawmaker who championed the bill. Burton conceded that the audit found no widespread fraud in Utah, and that vote-by-mail has increased turnout. But he cited an “Election Integrity Scorecard” by the Heritage Foundation, the influential national conservative think tank that published Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for Donald Trump’s second term. The scorecard ranks Utah 33rd among all states and the District of Columbia, docking Utah significantly for its policies on voter ID and absentee balloting. Burton said he expects that HB 300 will vault Utah into the list’s top 10, and made clear that he tailored his bill to that aim. “They [Heritage] think it should be a conscious decision for a voter to opt in to vote by mail,” he said. The lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action, has endorsed Burton’s bill.\n\nVivisecting a successful election system in Utah in order to gain brownie points with a right-wing intellectual chop shop in Washington is quite cultlike.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Cod-Soaker Friedman of the Algarve brings us a tale of bad chemistry. From News4 in Oklahoma City:\n\nLane Garrett and his family bought their land along the banks of the Cimarron River 16 years ago. “It’s real quiet out here,” Garrett said. “There’s lots of wildlife out here—turkey, quail, deer. There’s a river right over there.” The property sits at the very edge of Logan County, far from the noise and pollution of city life. “Very few people get to look out their kitchen window and see a river,” Garrett said.\n\nSounds idyllic. What could go wrong in paradise?\n\nThat’s why he and his family were frustrated when, in June 2024, they learned a pipeline would be running through their land. Phillips 66 went through the courts to condemn part of the family’s land, securing an easement to build the oil pipeline.\n\nOh, that could go wrong.\n\nConstruction began in January. “They bored underneath the river, and then it came up there on that north bank,” Garrett said. But with the work came a mess. “Just trash, you know, pop cans, chip cans,” Garrett said. “Cigarette butts, things like that.” Then, his brother, William, smelled something near the crew’s boring machine. “I was like, What? What is that? I know that smell, and I know it’s not good. What is that?” William Garrett said. “And then finally looked down and just a pool of hydraulic fluid.” Hydraulic fluid—and a lot of it—was seeping into their pasture. “I would say a good 20 feet to the north, you’d find it on the mud, little drops of where hydraulic fluid had just been sprayed in kind of a west-out direction,” Lane Garrett said.\n\nAfter first denying the whole thing, Phillips 66, the extraction beast that owned the pipeline, assured the Garretts that the hydraulic fluid had been cleaned up. They made a big show of doing so, even though the Garretts thought all the company was doing was “pushing dirt around.” When the cleanup was finally done, Garrett drilled a borehole into the area that allegedly had been cleaned. You can probably guess what they found.\n\n“You can see all that goopiness, all that hydraulic fluid,” William Garrett said. Sure enough, it was all still there—and thanks to recent rains—now heavily soaked into the groundwater all over their pasture, just yards away from the Cimarron River. Land—that the Garretts rely on. “I cut hay, bale hay, and then feed it, you know, to my neighbor’s cattle,” Lane Garrett said. It was supposed to be his family’s quiet paradise, away from the pollution.\n\n“It’s land that I put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into,” Lane Garrett said. But now, he says it’s land—he just can’t trust. “Now, rather than having chemicals just sitting on top of my pasture, now I’ve got a ball of chemicals, you know, five, six feet down underground in there, and that’s all going to kill everything above it,” Garrett said. “I just—I wanted all that stuff cleaned up. You know, I wish that, you know, the guys on the site, that they would have just been upfront, said, hey, look, there was an accident. This is what happened.”\n\nPipelines leak, and the companies that own them lie. That’s all ye know and all ye need to know.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.\n\n\n\n",

His explanations were ... unconventional. From :\n\nHe issued a muffled call for vaccinations in the affected community, but said the choice was a personal one. He suggested that measles vaccine injuries were more common than known, contrary to extensive research. He asserted that natural immunity to measles, gained through infection, somehow also protected against cancer and heart disease, a claim not supported by research. He cheered on questionable treatments like cod liver oil, and said that local doctors had achieved “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries with steroids or antibiotics.\n\nCod-liver oil? Is this guy possessed by the restless spirit of my grandmother? Why not Father John’s Medicine? Or Carter’s Little Liver Pills? Or even one of those old cough remedies that advertised the benefits of heroin. Wait, forget I said that.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Kennedy appeared frustrated that a vaccine-preventable illness rather than chronic disease had drawn national attention during his first weeks as secretary. “We’ve had two measles deaths in 20 years in this country—we have 100,000 autism diagnoses every year,” he said. “We need to keep our eye on the ball. Chronic disease is our enemy.” The suggestion that vaccines cause autism has been discredited by dozens of scientific studies.\n\n\n\nAsked whether he opposed so-called measles parties—events that parents hold to purposely spread measles from a sick child to healthy children—Mr. Kennedy said he would “never advise someone to get sick.” But he also praised the benefits of natural immunity, protection gained after becoming infected with a virus, claiming that it lasted longer than vaccine-induced immunity and may later protect against cancers and cardiac disease.\n\nThe secretary suggested that we all consult “frontline doctors,” who, he said, were getting great results from various unconventional nostrums “on the ground.” On the ground in Gaines County, Texas, epicenter of the outbreak, however, the frontline doctors seem to be asking him not to help quite so much.\n\nMr. Kennedy’s focus on unverified treatments has frustrated some doctors in Gaines County, who have been trying to explain to patients that there is no antiviral for measles and that they have little control over which patients suffer serious symptoms. “We already are dealing with people that think measles is not a big deal,” said Dr. Leila Myrick, a family medicine doctor in Seminole, Texas, who has been caring for patients with measles for several weeks. “Now they’re going to think they can get this miracle treatment and that they definitely don’t need to get vaccinated. It’s 100 percent going to make it harder.”\n\nAnd, in the Beyond, Hippocrates gets out of the business.",

That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U.

In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\n\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90.

He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\n\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\n\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense.

Don’t sell yourself out.”\n\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\n\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\n\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\n\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\n\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\n\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\n\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\n\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\n\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\n\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\n\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\n\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\n\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\n\nThe air between them bristles.\n\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\n\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\n\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\n\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\n\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\n\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\n\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\n\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\n\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\n\nYoung man: Then what are you?\n\nSalaam: I’m you.\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\n\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\n\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\n\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\n\nThe Central Park Six.\n\nThe Central Park Five.\n\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\n\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\n\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\n\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\n\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\n\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\n\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\n\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\n\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\n\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\n\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\n\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\n\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\n\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\n\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\n\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\n\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\n\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\n\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\n\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\n\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\n\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\n\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\n\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\n\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\n\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\n\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\n\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\n\n\n\nStory: Mark Warren\n\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\n\nStyling: Bill Mullen\n\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\n\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\n\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\n\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\n\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\n\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\n\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton",

        "content": "I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\n\n\n\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\n\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\n\n\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\n\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\n\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.",

        "content": "I was going to avoid commenting on the automobile ad cut on the White House grounds on Tuesday starring the president of the United States, his principal policy advisor, and the kid. I was going to give it a good leaving alone because I thought it was so self-evidently tacky and inappropriate as to beggar description. I mean, seriously, what’s next? The Tostitos Department of State?\n\nIt was established long before he got into politics that El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago was the reigning king of garish excess. Every one of his buildings was a gilded palace of sins against good taste. Years back, there was some talk about his buying the New England Patriots, and I distinctly remember writing a column for the Boston Herald in which I speculated that he was likely to build a waterfall into what was then Sullivan Stadium and probably add a white grand piano to one end zone. (Truth be told, the Pats were so bad in those days that any distraction would have been welcome.) And as evidenced by the fact that his wife tore up Jacqueline Kennedy’s rose garden and turned the East Wing into\n\ninto the set of a David Lynch movie for Christmas during his first term, his taste has not been refined very much.\n\nBut this spectacle on Tuesday, with Elon Musk standing there like Beelzebub in a ball cap, was envelope pushing taken to its extreme. “You want the future to look like the future,” Musk explained. “What kind of truck would Blade Runner drive?” Being a replicant himself, Musk has a natural interest in the answer to that question. But the president is just a terrible pitchman. He’s as desperate as one of those guys from Glengarry Glen Ross, talking fast, bragging about his great “imagination,” and apparently sending semaphore with his hands while waving around some promotional material Musk had provided him.\n\n“It’s like a golf cart that goes really fast,” Musk burbled as the president climbed into the driver’s seat.\n\nExcept, of course, sometimes they blow up, and sometimes they sink, and sometimes you have to walk through crowds of people who think Elon Musk really is Beelzebub in a ball cap just to get a test drive that you hope will not blow up or sink. It’s the new Golden Age, folks. Act today. Operators are standing by,",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "What has become plain this week is that the entire administration has committed itself to the president’s pipe dream of annexing Canada as the 51st state. It wasn’t just the president’s bizarre appearance with Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, in which the president took a short stroll around the Izonkosphere.\n\n“Canada only works as a state. … This would be the most incredible country visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S., just a straight artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many, many decades ago, and makes no sense.”\n\nIt is necessary at this point to mention that the so-called “artificial line” is usually referred to as a “border.” The president seems to grasp the concept when referring to the “artificial line” separating the United States and Mexico. Strange, that. The president went on.\n\n“It’s so perfect as a great and cherished state. I love [O, Canada]. I think it’s great. Keep it, but it will be for the state, one of our greatest states, maybe our greatest state.”\n\nWonderful. He’s going to let them keep their national anthem, one of the world’s most stirring, but only as a state song, like “On the Banks of the Wabash,” “Georgia on My Mind,” or “On, Wisconsin.” I suppose he’ll let them keep their hockey teams, too.\n\nThe whole episode should have brought about an instantaneous Cabinet meeting at which the 25th Amendment was invoked. The president was clearly irrational. Instead, there was Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick seconding the motion. From the Hill:\n\n“The best way, the president has said it, the best way to actually merge the economies of Canada and the United States is for Canada to become our 51st state. If they want to merge it, that’s how you make it the 51st state,” Lutnick said on Fox Business Network’s Varney & Co.\n\nIt really is a cult, you know.\n\nOn the Bluesky app, journalist and author Garrett Epps shrewdly pointed out that in Fletcher Knebel’s Night of Camp David, one of the first manifestations of President Mark Hollenbach’s mental illness was his secret desire to merge the United States and Canada—as well as all of Scandanavia—into a single entity called “Aspen.” In fact, the book was reissued during the first Trump administration, and it was referenced on TV by both Rachel Maddow and Bob Woodward. Now, though, with the president’s grand design seeming to parallel the grandiose foreign-policy proposal of the fictional President Hollenbach, the book has taken on an even greater salience.\n\n(By the way, the hero of the book is a young, ambitious first-term senator named James McVeagh with whom the crazy president shares his notions in the aforementioned night at Camp David. Maybe you can see J. Divan Vance in that role, but I can’t.)\n\nIn the novel, the crazy president sounds almost rational in explaining the irrational.\n\n“Canada is the wealthiest nation on earth.” Hollenbach’s words raced after each other. …“The mineral riches under her soil are incredible in their immensity. Even with modern demands, they are well-nigh inexhaustible. Believe me, Jim, Canada will be the seat of power in the next century and, properly exploited and conserved, her riches can go for a thousand years. ...\n\n.. But the merger of know-how, power, and character, the United States, Canada, and Scandinavia, the new nation under one parliament and one president could keep the peace for centuries. The president of the union should be the man who dreamed the dreams of giants. ...\n\n… “I only exclude Europe at the start,” said Hollenbach, and his face quickly lighted again. “Right now, Europe has nothing to give us. But once we have built the fortress of Aspen, I predict the nations of Europe will pound at the door to get in. And, if they don’t, we’ll have the power to force them into the new nation. … There are other kinds of pressure, trade duties and barriers, financial measures, economic sanctions, if you will. But, never fear, Jim. England, France, Germany, and the Low Countries, too, can be brought to heel.\n\nWhen Knebel wrote his classic Seven Days in May, about an attempted military junta in Washington, he was drawing on inside knowledge about the turmoil in the Kennedy administration between the president, the Joint Chiefs, and the intelligence community—turmoil that would do a lot to feed suspicions after the president’s murder in 1963. JFK was a big fan of the book, so much that he allowed director John Frankenheimer to photograph the White House so he could make the sets for his film adaptation.\n\nIn the case of Night of Camp David, Knebel was able to draw on American attempts to absorb Canada that dated back to the founding of the nation. In fact, Article XI of the original Articles of Confederation read as follows:\n\nCanada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this Union.\n\nThe American Revolution helped the new country break off those parts of British North America in and around the Great Lakes. We tried to seize the entire country in the War of 1812, but we failed, and we got Washington burned in the bargain. Through the years up to the American Civil War, there were annexation groups on both sides of the border.\n\nIn 1860, Secretary of State William Seward came close to annexing the territory from Washington state all the way up to Alaska, which at the time was owned by Russia. For a while, it looked like Great Britain might actually swing for the deal. But,when Seward bought Alaska in 1868, the people in the region began to feel uncomfortable with the U.S. closing in from both the north and south, so popular opinion shifted. Then, of course, there were the Fenians.\n\nThe Fenian Brotherhood was a product of one of the periodic risings in Ireland against British rule. It was the American wing of what was called in Ireland the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The American Fenians were a substantial force. They had money—upwards of $500,000—and weapons and an army made up of veterans of the American Civil War. (They were led by John O’Mahony, who’d fought with the 69th New York, part of the famed Irish Brigade.) After the war, the Fenians launched a series of raids into Canada. They came in two bursts—one in 1866 and another in 1870–71. They occurred all over Canada, from Manitoba to the Maritimes. None of them succeeded, and one of them, a raid around the Minnesota–Manitoba border, never even made it into Canada. The only real result was to strengthen Canadian nationalism; the raids were pivotal in the eventual development of the Canadian confederation in 1867, an arrangement that the current U.S. president believes would make a helluva 51st state. In the debate over forming the confederation, Sir John MacDonald said:\n\nIf we do not take advantage of the time, if we show ourselves unequal to the occasion, it may never return, and we shall hereafter bitterly and unavailingly regret having failed to embrace the happy opportunity now offered of founding a great nation under the fostering care of Great Britain, and our Sovereign Lady, Queen Victoria.\n\nOne of MacDonald’s primary concerns while forming the confederation was American meddling, especially in the rebellious western parts of Canada. He wrote to his minister of finance:\n\nI cannot understand the desire of the Colonial Office, or of the Company, to saddle the responsibility of the government on Canada just now. It would so completely throw the game into the hands of the insurgents and the Yankee wirepullers, who are to some extent influencing and directing the movement from St. Paul that we cannot foresee the consequences.\n\nYou always have to watch out for those Yankee wirepullers. Can’t trust them worth a damn.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the “Last Call with Charles P. Pierce” newsletter. Subscribe here.",

        "content": "They’ve done everything except hang a sign at every port of entry reading, CLOSED: UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT. From The Washington Post:\n\nCanadians are skipping trips to Disney World and music festivals. Europeans are eschewing U.S. national parks, and Chinese travelers are vacationing in Australia instead. International travel to the United States is expected to slide by 5 percent this year, contributing to a $64 billion shortfall for the travel industry, according to Tourism Economics. The research firm had originally forecast a 9 percent increase in foreign travel, but revised its estimate late last month to reflect “polarizing Trump Administration policies and rhetoric.”\n\nThis moment isn’t without precedent. Sacks notes that international tourism slowed sharply during the first Trump presidency, amounting to roughly $20 billion in unrealized revenue, even before covid-related disruptions. Back then, it was tourists from Mexico, China and the Middle East who were pulling back, deterred by the administration’s travel bans, tariffs and tough talk on immigration. This time, Canada—the top source of international travel to the United States—is poised to lead the way. Trump has for weeks said he wants to make the country a “51st state.” In response, Canada’s former prime minister, Justin Trudeau, urged Canadians not to vacation in the United States.\n\nPeople don’t want to come here any more. Come April, here in Boston, the administration may have a worse effect on international participation in the Boston Marathon than the pandemic did. In three years, Los Angeles is due to host the Olympics and the Paralympics, and it’s hard to imagine we’ll have regained the trust of the world by then.\n\nAnd then there are all the other reasons people have to come to this country that, in its previous generosity, it shared with the world. No more Japanese people on the Freedom Trail up here. No more Brits visiting Independence Hall in Philadelphia to show they don’t hold any grudges. No more Brazilians, or Costa Ricans, or, God help us, Venezuelans staring awestruck into the Grand Canyon. And, what the hell, the government doesn’t care about national parks anymore anyway.\n\nBertha Lopez, who is from Mexico and lives near Toronto, used to cross the U.S. border every few weeks to buy staples like butter and cheese. This year, she’s stopped all of that — and vows not to set foot in the United States for at least a few years. She recently canceled a trip to Arizona to visit a longtime friend whose husband is ill; instead, she’s buying her friend a ticket to visit her in Canada this summer. “All of this talk of making Canada the 51st state has been upsetting. It’s just incredibly offensive,” the 54-year-old said. “So I’m doing what I can: No more Tide. No more Coca-Cola. No more Disney. And barring a funeral or someone in the hospital, I am not going to the United States.”\n\nForgive us, world, for we knew damn well what we were doing.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\n\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\n\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\n\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\n\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\n\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\n\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\n\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\n\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\n\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\n\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\n\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\n\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\n\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\n\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\n\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\n\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\n\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\n\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\n\nIt would be his undoing.\n\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\n\nI’m looking now, just across the river\n\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\n\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\n\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\n\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\n\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-­dressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\n\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\n\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\n\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\n\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\n\n\n\nMr. Monger,\n\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\n\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\n\nHypocrite!\n\nHAHA faggot.\n\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n\n\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\n\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\n\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\n\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\n\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\n\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\n\nBubba, where are the guns?\n\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\n\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\n\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\n\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\n\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\n\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\n\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\n\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\n\n\n\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\n\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\n\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\n\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\n\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\n\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\n\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\n\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\n\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\n\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\n\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\n\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\n\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\n\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\n\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\n\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\n\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\n\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\n\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\n\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\n\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\n\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\n\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\n\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\n\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\n\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\n\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\n\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\n\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\n\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\n\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\n\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\n\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\n\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\n\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\n\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\n\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\n\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres­sive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\n\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\n\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\n\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\n\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\n\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug­gle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\n\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\n\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\n\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-­four-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\n\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\n\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\n\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\n\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\n\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\n\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\n\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\n\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\n\n\n\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\n\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\n\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\n\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\n\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\n\n“I won’t,” her father said.\n\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\n\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics­ville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\n\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\n\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\n\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\n\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\n\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\n\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\n\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\n\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\n\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\n\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\n\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\n\n\n\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\n\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\n\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\n\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\n\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\n\n“I came to check on you.”\n\n“Who’s with you?”\n\n“I’m by myself.”\n\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\n\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\n\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\n\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\n\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\n\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\n\n“Let me talk to him.”\n\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\n\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\n\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\n\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\n\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\n\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\n\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\n\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\n\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\n\nAnd then silence.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\n\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\n\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\n\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\n\n",

        "content": "Goddamn, even this? From NPR:\n\nAfter a recent change by the Trump administration, the federal government no longer explicitly prohibits contractors from having segregated restaurants, waiting rooms, and drinking fountains. The segregation clause is one of several identified in a public memo issued by the General Services Administration last month, affecting all civil federal agencies. The memo explains that it is making changes prompted by President Trump’s executive order on diversity, equity and inclusion, which repealed an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 regarding federal contractors and nondiscrimination. The memo also addresses Trump’s executive order on gender identity.\n\nSeveral federal agencies, including the departments of Defense, Commerce and Homeland Security, have notified staff who oversee federal contracts that they should start instituting these changes. A recent notice from the National Institutes of Health shows that the change is already in effect. The notice, regarding a maintenance agreement for scientific freeze dryers, cites the GSA memo and reads, “FAR 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities and FAR 52.222-26—Equal Opportunity will not be considered when making award decisions or enforce requirements.”\n\n“Equal Opportunity will not be considered...”\n\nGive my regards to 1954 and remember me to Orval Faubus. And the eye of Sauron descends on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, eventually, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nTo be clear, all businesses—those that have government contracts and those that do not—still need to follow federal and state laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes segregated facilities illegal.\n\nFor now.\n\nOn this issue, especially, I do not want to hear anything from the anti-Trump Republicans. Almost from the time Lyndon Johnson handed Dr. King the pen with which h’d signed the CRA in 1964, the Republican Party determined to derive political benefits from attaching itself to the angry remnants of American apartheid. Almost to a person, our new allies made their careers within that context and, as best as I can recall, none of them raised a moral or political objection to the largely successful rollback of the achievements of the civil-rights movement. That is the singular moral failure at the heart of modern American conservatism.\n\n(LBJ saw it coming. And what he said to Bill Moyers is the gentler American equivalent of what Michael Collins said after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921: “I have signed my own death warrant.” They were both right.)\n\nElsewhere in the backward march of history, remember the great story of the Navajo Code Talkers, the Native soldiers who used their tribal language as an unbreakable code during World War II in the Pacific? (Made a pretty good movie, too, with Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach.) Well, apparently, it’s time to forget them again. From the Military Times:\n\nMany links that previously took viewers to informational articles about the Native American service members who used their native language as an indecipherable code to help win World War I and II were no longer accessible as of Tuesday afternoon. A Pentagon spokesperson said the department was working to rectify the situation.\n\nShut up. You got caught.\n\n“The department is restoring content about the Navajo Code Talkers,” the spokesperson said. “It had previously been removed during the auto-removal process.”\n\nSomebody had to program the auto-removal process, which means a decision was made to delete the Navajo material, probably along with the records of minority Medal of Honor winners. And we all have to admit now that LBJ pretty much low-balled that prediction.\n\n",

        "content": "Every product was carefully curated by an Esquire editor. We may earn a commission from these links. Here’s how we test products and why you should trust us.\n\n(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nBy now, a number of people have shared the video of Rep. Bill Keating’s standing up for Rep. Sarah McBride against her being deliberately misgendered by dumbass Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas). In fact, Keating’s righteous blast at Self was so loud that it almost obscured McBride’s neat little thrust of the shiv when she responded to Self as “Madam Chair.” Sweet.\n\nAnyway, up here, Keating’s response to Self’s nasty introduction of McBride came as something of a surprise. In a congressional delegation containing a number of high-profile members, Bill Keating is something of a backbencher, even though he’s been in Congress since 2011, representing a district that includes Cape Cod and the south coast of Massachusetts. He’s always been a stalwart on issues affecting the LGBTQ+ communities. But the iron in his spine that he demonstrated in Congress the other day comes as no surprise to those of us who remember his noble but failed attempt to overthrow William Bulger as president of the state senate in 1994. This roughly coincided with Bulger’s serial-killer brother Whitey’s decision to go on the lam for 16 years. Still, not many people crossed either Bulger and walked away. Keith Self was no problem at all.\n\nOn Thursday, my friend John Feinstein passed away unexpectedly at the age of 69. During my days as a daily sports columnist—and, before that, as a daily sports reporter specializing in college basketball in the winter and tennis in the summer—John was a fairly consistent presence in my life in the traveling sportswriting circus that follows the major events of the calendar. A Final Four or a US Open in Flushing Meadows without John was unthinkable—though I have to admit that two weeks at the Open with John’s constant (and bad) imitation of Ivan Lendl could be a trial. In 1986, of course, he published , an account of a year spent with Bob Knight’s Indiana Hoosiers that, through the dint of his dogged reporting, was the first look into the fact that IU’s basketball team was being run by a sociopath (although, ultimately, the book pulled that punch). No matter, the book has now sold over 8 million copies, and it broke the best-seller lists for sports books of all kinds. After that, John turned out one book after another, like clockwork, every spring. There were two giants of Father’s Day book sales. One was Abraham Lincoln, and the other was John Feinstein.\n\nHe could be impossible. He was as dogmatic as anyone I ever met. He knew what he knew, and he thought he knew what you knew, and he would not be shaken in either belief. He had his favorites, and he was also unshakable in his support of them. (The most heated argument we ever had was over his support of the late Jim Valvano, whom John adored despite his disdain for most coaches who bent the rules as badly as Valvano did.) But dammit, he also had a heart as big as the Ritz, and that made all the difference, and how can you not love a guy who responded to Knight’s calling him both a “whore” and a “pimp” by saying he wished Knight would make up his mind so he’d know how to dress?\n\nThe great Dave McKenna has written a proper obituary over at Defector. We ran in different circles the past few years, and we’d fallen out of touch. Apparently, his last few years had been tinged with more than a little melancholy. I will miss knowing that he’s out there in the world, which is a much quieter place these days, and there are too many empty chairs at the table. May his memory be a blessing.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Stomp Off, Let’s Go” (Fat Babies): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from 1955, is the arrival of Barbara Porritt, the millionth migrant to land in Australia. She shares the video with a Dutch family of 16. Considering how many “migrants” arrived in Australia against their will, the sunniness of this arrival is a nice historical antidote. History is so cool.\n\nIn advance of Himself’s Day on Monday, Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland, stopped by the White House this week and got a good close-up look at what we’ve done to ourselves nowadays. He was greeted by a presidential “episode” that must have made him wonder if all those decades of emigration had been worth it after all. From the AP:\n\nAsked if Ireland, a member of the EU, was taking advantage, too, Trump said, “of course they are. I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn’t have let it happen.” He was referring to the concentration of U.S. pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, due to the country’s tax policies. “We had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn’t have a clue or let’s say they weren’t businesspeople, but they didn’t have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies,” Trump said.\n\nMartin affected the look of a man who suddenly had found himself involved in a carny sideshow as the president went a-wandering in his mind.\n\nAt one point, Trump became distracted as he talked about inflation in the U.S. “By the way, I love these socks. What’s with these socks? I’m trying to stay focused, but I’m very impressed with the VP’s socks,” Trump said, drawing chuckles from others in the room. Vance had worn socks patterned with small green shamrocks as a nod to Martin’s visit. When a reporter asked Martin why his country would let [Rosie] O’Donnell move there, Trump jumped at the opening. “I like that question,” the president said, adding that Martin was “better off not knowing” about O’Donnell.\n\n(The “reporter” who lobbed this hunk of insane banality into the dialogue was Brian Glenn of the Real America’s Voice, a wing-nut marionette who was the guy who criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not wearing a suit when he met with the president and who also is famously the current main squeeze of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Here’s Tiger Beat on the Potomac taking Glenn’s bullshit seriously.)\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look at what we found! From Smithsonian:\n\nThe Donggung palace complex in present-day South Korea was once an elaborate lakeside retreat with at least 26 buildings used for hosting festivals and banquets. Now, archaeologists have also discovered several innovative “flush” toilets at the 1,300-year-old site, including one that likely drained into a nearby waterway. During recent excavations at the complex, researchers found a small two-room building with a hole in the middle of a cut granite slab, according to a statement from the Korean Heritage Service. On either side of the hole, they found wide stepping stones.\n\nExperts think waste from the toilet funneled into an underground holding chamber, similar to those used in outhouses or portable toilets. A servant likely poured water into the hole to flush the waste down a drain and into the chamber. Inside the palace, researchers also found a flush toilet that “directly discharges human waste into the river through a drain,” Kim Gyeong Yeol, an archaeologist with the Korean Heritage Service who led the recent excavations, tells Live Science’s Owen Jarus. The interior toilet was probably reserved for use by the crown prince and his court ladies.\n\nI would point out that this is pretty much the same system to which the Supreme Court gave its blessing not that long ago. Plus ça change, plus ça ick.\n\nHey ABC News, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nThe large rock was excavated from the Callide Basin in central Queensland and gifted to the Moura State High School, where it sat unnoticed for two decades, according to the University of Queensland. When paleontologists were asked by the school to examine a cluster of three-toed track marks on the boulder, they found it contains one of the highest concentrations of dinosaur footprints per square meter ever documented in the country, according to a paper published Monday in Historical Biology.\n\nThe rock contains 66 footprints from 47 individual dinosaurs, Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland and lead author of the study, said in a statement. The footprints were likely imprinted onto the boulder as the dinosaurs passed across a patch of wet, white clay, possibly walking along or crossing a waterway during the Early Jurassic period, about 200 million years ago, Romilio said. “It’s an unprecedented snapshot of dinosaur abundance, movement and behavior from a time when no fossilized dinosaur bones have been found in Australia,” Romilio said.\n\nIn addition to being the name of my next prog-rock band, Dinosaur Abundance appeals to me as a concept. Maybe they were all having a dance back in the day. In any case, they gathered then to make us happy now.\n\n\n\nI’ll be back on Monday for whatever fresh hell awaits. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "America is a great country because every foul-tempered has-been hack can grow up to be president. From Politico:\n\n“I’ve only been back two months, I have no idea what I’m doing,” Rahm I. Emanuel, operative-turned-politician-turned-diplomat told me before adding his stock line since returning from serving as ambassador to Japan. “I’m not done with public service and I’m hoping public service is not done with me.”\n\nI’m telling you, Tiger Beat on the Potomac’s Jonathan Martin is positively aglow at the thought of this boorish triangulator back in the spotlight. In the immortal words of the late Mr. Zappa—“Oooh, gooey, dripping, steaming!”\n\nSince coming home in January from his stint in Tokyo—a job he repurposed to be American envoy to all of Asia—Emanuel has been as visible as any other Democrat. Never mind that he currently holds no office and hasn’t been on a ballot for a decade. Name the political podcast and Emanuel has likely been on it or will be shortly. He immediately snagged a CNN contract and regular Washington Post column, no small accomplishment for a former official at a moment of retrenchment for news organizations. He’s also hitting the lecture circuit, appearing for paid and gratis gigs before audiences such as the Realtors and the Chicago Economic Club. Emanuel is pointedly avoiding Ivy League campuses and later this month will make his first stop on a service academy tour when he speaks at West Point. Just as striking is to talk to anybody in high-level Democratic politics who knows Emanuel—which is to say most everyone—and hear how matter of fact they are about the inevitability of his candidacy.\n\nI cannot think of another Democrat more unsuited to the current political moment than Rahm Fcking Emanuel, whose only real political gift is alienating members of his party’s political base. He is now recasting himself as the man with all the grown-up concerns. He’s following the recent trail blazed by Gavin Newsom, except that, unlike Newsom, Emanuel isn’t directly attacking a segment of the trans community. He’s asking the Democrats to blow past the issue entirely, and it’s making Jonathan Martin positively giddy.\n\n“I am done with the discussion of locker rooms, I am done with the discussion of bathrooms and we better start having a conversation about the classroom,” Emanuel said, drawing applause as he alluded to a new study showing more than two-thirds of eighth graders can’t read at grade level. He kept coming back to the study and eventually and explicitly tied the policy to the politics, in Rahm’ian fashion.\n\nOoooh, he has his own adjective now. Do go on.\n\nShortly after his trip to Washington, Emanuel dashed out to Los Angeles to appear on Bill Maher’s show, where he went even further for a less sober audience. “In seventh grade, if I had known I could’ve said the word ‘they’ and gotten in the girls’ bathroom, I would’ve done it,” he said. “We literally are a superpower, we’re facing off against China with 1.4 billion people and two-thirds of our children can’t read eighth grade level.”\n\nThere it all was, in two appearances. Emanuel’s gift for finding a towering issue hidden in plain view; his tactical skills for grasping the political benefits it could confer, delivered with a snappy sound bite to elevate statistics off the page; linking domestic policy to geopolitics and sending a message about another, more controversial topic; and not merely urging Democrats to move on from trans youth issues, but using them as a vehicle to shift the conversation to ground he, and most in his party, would prefer to fight on. Gavin, are you listening?\n\nChristmighty, get a room, will you?\n\nFor the record, Emanuel's history with public education is...how you say?...spotty. As mayor of Chicago, he went to war with the city's teachers and their unions. In 2012, 26,000 members walked out in protest of stalled negotiations on a new contract. The strike went on for seven days despite Emanuel's failed attempt to get a court to order the teachers back to work, and the teachers cleaned his clock. The strike was so successful that it is credited with a revival of unionism in America generally, and with breaking the bipartisan consensus on education \"reform,\" particularly in the area of standardized testing, which has lost a great deal of its allure.\n\nIn fact, Emanuel's tenure as mayor of Chicago unquestionably will be the focus of all the oppo should he actually run for president, and the most fruitful area of research will be Emanuel's relationship to the renegade Chicago Police Department. (How renegade? The Guardian revealed that the CPD was running what essentially was a black site in an old warehouse.) It was his pattern to deflect and stonewall on police accountability until cornered by the weight of public outcry and/or the power of a federal investigation. At which point, Emanuel would make a great show of getting \"out in front\" of the issue. The classic case was the police murder of 17-year old Laquan McDonald in 2014. From Bloomberg:\n\nBy the time of the 2015 deaths of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Sandra Bland in Texas—both of whom died under questionable circumstances while in police custody—the BLM cause was ascendant. And nowhere did a collision between BLM and the police seem more inevitable at that point than in Chicago, where evidence of decades of police corruption and brutality concerning Black and Latino civilians was surfacing, and it was beyond refutation.\n\n\n\nThis was the political climate that greeted Emanuel as he started his second term as mayor in mid-2015, and he could have gotten in front of the policing issue before a clash happened. Instead, just months into that term, he antagonized both sides. At an October 2015 White House gathering of law enforcement officials, Emanuel said Chicago police officers had gone “fetal”—that they were shrinking back in their public safety duties because of social media-driven backlash to police brutality, or out of fear they’d get caught on live-streaming services doing something shady. In that one statement, he scapegoated police reform activists and infantilized the police force.\n\nThis, I guess, is what Politico would call Emanuel’s tactical skills for grasping political benefits.\n\nI guess that’s what Politico would call Rahm’ian fashion. And then I, for one, will throw up.\n\n\n\n",

On Thursday, it was reported that the Department of Defense would be briefing a certain unelected ketamine proponent on the country's secret war plans for a possible conflict with China. The angry talking yam began storming around Pennsylvania Avenue, eating its own liver.\n\nElon Musk will be briefed by the Pentagon about the USA’s top secret plans against China should there be a War, according to the Failing New York Times, one of the worst and most purposely inaccurate newspapers anywhere in the World. Their FAKE concept for this story is that because Elon does some business in China, that he is very conflicted and would immediately go to top Chinese officials and 'spill the beans.' RATINGS CHALLENGED FAKE NEWS CNN immediately picked up on this absolutely ridiculous and false story, which is probably libelous, and went heavy with it. Fortunately, nobody was watching!\n\nMaggot Hagerman, the really dumb 'scammer' who constantly writes about me for the Times, using anonymous, made up (nonexistent!) sources, and who I haven’t spoken to in ages, is a big part of the Scam. She lead the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, only to realize that she was duped and got it wrong. She owes me a totally discredited Pulitzer Prize for her bad reporting. The Fake News is the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE…And Elon is NOT BEING BRIEFED ON ANYTHING CHINA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR!!!\n\nYou may be comforted by the fact that \"Elon\" indeed will not be being briefed by \"the Department of War,\" which we haven't had since 1947. And, anyway, Henry Knox has been dead since 1806 and is therefore unavailable for private briefings. The vulgar talking yam continues to stalk the Beltway, howling in all caps until hell won't even have it.\n\nOver at the White House, they've appointed a new liaison to NASA, which once represented all that was smart and good—and, in all honesty, white—about America. His name is Darren Bossie, and he worked for the first iteration of the West Wing of Hell. He is a young man of vast experience, as the New Yorker pointed out.\n\nDarren Bossie, the new White House liaison to NASA, arrived shortly after Trump’s Inauguration. Bossie was more or less unknown at the agency, but employees soon found his LinkedIn profile. He had spent four of the past seven years bouncing around conservative politics, with a stint as Trump’s White House liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and had worked as a senior consultant for unnamed companies. For the bulk of his professional life, however—from 2006 to 2018—he had been an assistant manager at a Total Wine & More in Palm Beach County, Florida.\n\n“That didn’t seem very promising,” a senior NASA official told me.\n\nCan't put anything past those guys.\n\nHowever, young Bossie prompted additional interest in those of us who have been tracking conservative ratfcking for a while.\n\nA review of public records, however, suggested that Darren is the brother of David N. Bossie, the president of Citizens United—the conservative group whose litigation before the Supreme Court empowered mega-donors and corporations to make unlimited contributions to political candidates.\n\nBoy howdy, has David Bossie left a long trail of fcked rats behind him. He made his bones with his infamous activities against candidate, and then against President, Bill Clinton. David Bossie was the guy who forced his way into the hospital room where a woman was ministering to her husband who had suffered a stroke. The woman's daughter, Susan Coleman, had committed suicide, and Bossie claimed to believe the hoax that Coleman had killed herself because Clinton had gotten her pregnant. Bossie's tactics have managed to get him condemned by President George H.W. Bush, fired as a congressional investigator, and even marked lousy by the first Trump administration for profiteering off the president's image. (That's the president's job, dammit.) However, he forever will be a conservative hero because he was one of the leaders of a political activist outfit called Citizens United, which was used to demolish any possibility of sensible political financial reform, perhaps forever. So we all have to deal with the Bossie family again because you can't get away from Republican buccaneering even in outer space.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick To Click: \"Empire State Express\" (Son House): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit To The Pathé Archives: Here, from the Roaring (if goofy) Twenties, are some popular British party games. The \"forfeit\" of having to sit on a bottle while attempting to light a cigarette seems to be a lot harder than you'd think it was. Just hazarding a guess here that some gin was involved off-camera. On the other hand, this looks like the original source material for Eyes Wide Shut. History is so cool.\n\nMy god, this is an historic first. From the Washington Monthly:\n\nMaybe it’s time for J.D. Vance to face some questions. Vance’s favorability is worse than Harris’s at the same two-month mark and perhaps worse than any new vice president in the history of polling. His Real Clear Politics favorable-unfavorable rating is 41.7 percent-44.8 percent, a slightly worse net favorable rating (-3.1 percentage points) than Donald Trump’s (-0.9). When looking only at March polling—sampled after his infamous Oval Office hectoring of Ukraine’s president—he’s even more underwater: 42.4 percent-48.0 percent.\n\nThis is pure instinctive revulsion. Vance hasn't really done anything yet except run his mouth, get booed at the Kennedy Center, and Be There, and that's apparently been enough.\n\nA Vance ‘28 campaign, I suspect, will be bogged down with immense baggage from his current stint in the public sector, without the ability to lean on any record of success in the private sector—save for a profitable book with a message that has no resemblance to anything Vance peddles today. If Trump taps a namesake to carry on his legacy.\n\nI think they've never trusted his naked ambition and, as the president appears to continue down the road of cognitive deterioration, he's going to get blamed for every story out of the White House about how the president is headed for La La Land. Can't say I blame the cult for this, either.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From Popular Mechanics:\n\nArchaeologists excavating a private property in Florence, Italy, discovered a 20-inch statue of Hercules missing its head, though not altogether headless. Despite no cranium on the Greek hero, the statue included details from Hercules’ mythic 12 labors, including the skin of the Nemean lion and the severed head of the Cretan bull. The statue was dated to between the middle and late Imperial age from the third to fourth centuries, A.D., according to a translated report from Italian media, making it a roughly 1,700 find. The diminutive statue depicts a nude Hercules leaning to his right on his club, adorned with the trophies from his labors. According to Greek mythology, the Oracle of Delphi advised Hercules to travel to Tiryns to serve his cousin, King Eurystheus of Mycenae, for 12 years, for which he would be rewarded with immortality.\n\nAnd I guess, in one way, ol' Herc was rewarded. All it cost was his head.\n\nHey, New Scientist. Is it a good day for dinosaur news? It's always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nA new species of dinosaur found at a Mongolian building site has the largest fully preserved claw ever found. The bipedal, herbivorous animal had only two fingers on each hand, which it may have used to grasp branches and pull them towards its mouth. The 90-million-year-old fossil–which included parts of the pelvis, both arms and hands, and numerous vertebrae–was found near Khanbogd in the Gobi desert in 2012, but it has only now been properly studied and given the scientific name Duonychus tsogtbaatari. The genus name means “two claws” and the species name honours Mongolian palaeontologist Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar.\n\nThe researchers think the claws were an adaptation to grabbing and pulling down vegetation. With fewer fingers, each one could be stronger and more flexible, allowing for a tighter, more controlled grip, says Kobayashi. “The curved claws and extreme flexion suggest it could hook onto branches or clusters of leaves more easily,” he says. “Three fingers might have just gotten in the way, while two provided a more precise and efficient grasp.”\n\nGiant claws used merely to grab leaves? What a waste. I'm sure they can clean that up for the next movie. They lived, healthily and regularly, with plenty of roughage, to make us happy now.\n\nI'll be back on Monday, for whatever fresh hell awaits... Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and The New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the tornadoes throughout the southeast, and for everyone touched by floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by The Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in LA, now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.\n\n",

        "content": "Lee Zeldin, the new boss of the Environmental Protection Agency, isn’t kidding around. He’s spoilin’ for some despoilin’, and he doesn’t care who knows it. From :\n\nLee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reframed the purpose of the E.P.A. In a two-minute-and-18-second video posted to X, Mr. Zeldin boasted about the changes and said his agency’s mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”\n\n“From the campaign trail to Day 1 and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,” Mr. Zeldin said. “We at E.P.A. will do our part to power the great American comeback.” Nowhere in the video did he refer to protecting the environment or public health, twin tenets that have guided the agency since its founding in 1970.\n\nBecause, as we know, there is no public cost to environmentally inflicted disease or industrial pollution.\n\nMr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would unwind more than two dozen protections against air and water pollution. It would overturn limits on soot from smokestacks that have been linked to respiratory problems in humans and premature deaths as well as restrictions on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. It would get rid of the “good neighbor rule” that requires states to address their own pollution when it’s carried by winds into neighboring states. And it would eliminate enforcement efforts that prioritize the protection of poor and minority communities.\n\nGive Zeldin credit. He may have decided that his job is to help Republican donors poison the whole damn country, but he has by God learned his lines well.\n\nIn perhaps its most consequential act, the agency said it would work to erase the E.P.A.’s legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that show global warming is endangering humanity. In his video, Mr. Zeldin derisively referred to that legal underpinning as “the holy grail of the climate change religion.” Mr. Zeldin called Wednesday’s actions “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.” He added, “today the green new scam ends, as the E.P.A. does its part to usher in a golden age of American success.”\n\nIt is a well-established fact that the average American corporation doesn’t have the social conscience God gave the Gaboon viper. Now that attitude has a friendly administration. Zeldin’s brief is to keep the Environmental Protection Agency from doing anything substantive to protect the environment. Here is what passes for optimism.\n\nThe announcements do not carry the force of law. In almost every case, the E.P.A. would have to undergo a lengthy process of public comment and develop environmental and economic justifications for the change.\n\nFirst of all, Zeldin and the administration couldn’t care less about what is said in the “process” of public comment, and they will pull their environmental and economic justifications for the despoilin’ out of the collected works of Professor Otto Yerass. And nobody will be there to stop them. And not for nothing, as Senator Sheldon Whitehouse points out, Zeldin probably lied during his confirmation hearings.\n\n“Today is the day Trump’s Big Oil megadonors paid for,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. He called the E.P.A. moves a series of attacks on clean air, clean water and affordable energy. “Administrator Zeldin clearly lied when he told us that he would respect the science and listen to the experts,” Mr. Whitehouse said, referring to Mr. Zeldin’s confirmation hearing.\n\nNot that anyone who matters cares. Rivers will die now, choked to death by Fox News talking points.\n\n",

        "content": "As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\n\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\n\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\n\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\n\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\n\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical?",

From The New York Times:\n\nAnother official said the briefing would be China focused, without providing additional details. A fourth official confirmed Mr. Musk was to be at the Pentagon on Friday, but offered no details. Hours after news of the planned meeting was published by The New York Times. Pentagon officials and President Trump denied that the session would be about military plans involving China. “China will not even be mentioned or discussed,” Mr. Trump said in a late-night social media post. It was not clear if the briefing for Mr. Musk would go ahead as originally planned. But providing Mr. Musk access to some of the nation’s most closely guarded military secrets would be a dramatic expansion of his already extensive role as an adviser to Mr. Trump and leader of his effort to slash spending and purge the government of people and policies they oppose.\n\nSomehow, I am rarely reassured by what is said by the president in “late-night social media” posts. Neither am I reassured by the fact that the Pentagon is currently run by a former Jägermeister spokesmodel.\n\nPentagon war plans, known in military jargon as O-plans or operational plans, are among the military’s most closely guarded secrets. If a foreign country were to learn how the United States planned to fight a war against them, it could reinforce its defenses and address its weaknesses, making the plans far less likely to succeed. The top-secret briefing that exists for the China war plan has about 20 to 30 slides that lay out how the United States would fight such a conflict. It covers the plan beginning with the indications and warning of a threat from China to various options on what Chinese targets to hit, over what time period, that would be presented to Mr. Trump for decisions, according to officials with knowledge of the plan.\n\nLastly, I am not reassured by the fact that, if it ever came to guns with China, this guy’s creations would be fighting for both sides, and not just because whatever it is he manufactured is even money to glitch itself into the Mariana Trench shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.\n\nLosing Democracy by the Dose—A Novel.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "The good folks at the Brennan Center for Justice have delivered a helpful primer on the Alien Enemies Act, that dusty, tattered old fig leaf being used by the administration to cover itself for its new mass deportation project. You will be shocked, I’m sure, to learn that the administration is misusing this Revolution-era relic to serve the president’s own mad purposes.\n\nAs the Supreme Court and past presidents have acknowledged, the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority enacted and implemented under the war power. When the Fifth Congress passed the law and the Wilson administration defended it in court during World War I, they did so on the understanding that noncitizens with connections to a foreign belligerent could be “treated as prisoners of war” under the “rules of war under the law of nations.” In the Constitution and other late-1700s statutes, the term invasion is used literally, typically to refer to large-scale attacks. The term predatory incursion is also used literally in writings of that period to refer to slightly smaller attacks like the 1781 Raid on Richmond led by American defector Benedict Arnold.\n\nToday, some anti-immigration politicians and groups urge a non-literal reading of invasion and predatory incursion so that the Alien Enemies Act can be invoked in response to unlawful migration and cross-border narcotics trafficking. These politicians and groups view the Alien Enemies Act as a turbocharged deportation authority. But their proposed reading of the law is at odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice, all of which confirm that the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority. Invoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse.\n\nThe problem is that there is enough leaky precedent regarding the use of this law for the administration to use for its own purposes. (For example, President Truman used it to extend wartime detentions and deportations until 1951.) Moreover, as the Brennan report makes clear, there is a yawning loophole through which the courts can dive if they choose to do so.\n\nThe courts should strike down any attempted peacetime use of the Alien Enemies Act, but the political question doctrine may prevent them from doing so. This doctrine cautions the courts against addressing issues that fall within Congress and the president’s constitutional duties and that lack judicially manageable standards for resolution. The courts have used the political question doctrine to avoid resolving claims that touch on matters of war and peace, as well as other sensitive foreign policy matters.\n\nNevertheless, this was a law that was an offense against the Constitution almost from birth. It was part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, President John Adams’s lasting gift to future American autocrats that Thomas Jefferson deemed to be part of the “reign of witches.” In fact, the Alien Enemies Act is the only one of those noxious statutes still on the books, as the Brennan Center said in an earlier report, because it was the only one of those acts without a “sunset” clause. Attempts to repeal it have failed, repeatedly. So like the Espionage Act and other laws enacted to respond to temporary (or imaginary) threats, it sits in our laws like a sleeping virus awaiting another outbreak, like this one.",

From Reuters:\n\nNASA terminates chief scientist role...\n\nWhy should NASA, of all places, have the luxury of a chief scientist? Is that waste or fraud or abuse?\n\nNASA’s acting administrator Janet Petro told employees by email on Monday the Office of the Chief Scientist, the Office of Science, Policy, and Strategy, and the diversity, equity and inclusion branch within the Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity would be closed. The email was seen by Reuters.\n\nMany of NASA’s 18,000 employees have been anxious over the Trump administration efforts to trim back the federal bureaucracy, which have been spearheaded by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, has contracts worth roughly $15 billion with NASA, according to federal contracting data.\n\nActually, were I seeking to eliminate waste in the NASA budget, I might examine the $15 billion parceled out to a company that’s been regularly raining debris all over the Caribbean, but that’s just me.\n\nPetro said in the email that NASA had been actively working with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to implement Trump’s January executive order directing government agencies to reduce and reorganize their workforce. NASA’s policy, diversity and science offices are the latest space-focused units in the U.S. to be affected by Trump and Musk’s government efficiency agenda.\n\nIt is important—and very sad—to note that the current chief scientist, Katherine Calvin, is a prominent climatologist who has contributed to several United Nations reports on the climate crisis, and last month Calvin and several other delegates were denied permission to attend a climate conference in China. And this reminds us that the administration is laying off 1,100 people at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But this administration has wished the climate crisis out into the Phantom Zone, so I’m sure none of this will matter.",

For the moment, however, let’s not ask for the moon here. It’s time to press hard on the grunts carrying those orders out. They’re all complicit in illegal acts. They’re all arguably involved in a conspiracy to obstruct justice because of their involvement in defying legitimate orders of the federal courts. Arrest the ICE agents. Arrest the guards. Hell, arrest the pilots who flew the prison planes to El Salvador; arrest whoever slapped the cuffs on Mahmoud Khalil and whoever it was who hustled him off into the night. Arrest enough of them and, maybe, there will be fewer people willing to hide beneath the smoke screens of the administration and its clownish legal teams, by which I definitely include the entire Department of Justice.

This is what she said:\n\n“I would have to check in with the Department of Homeland Security, but it’s a great question,” Leavitt said when asked if any migrants have self-deported, “and we’re very proud to repurpose this app, which the Biden administration abused to facilitate the mass illegal entry of illegal immigrants into our country. It was like a fast pass at Disneyland. That’s not happening under this administration.

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "New Yorkers work hard, but their shoes work harder. Living in the city my whole life, I’ve taken dozens of beat-up boots, flats, brogues, and sandals to my local cobblers, but never had I considered taking a pair of sneakers in for a tune-up until I learned about the Veja repair program.\n\nFounded in June 2020, the \"Clean, Repair, and Collect\" initiative was started by the Paris-based sneaker brand to keep people from throwing out their sneakers when they eventually lost their luster. First, Veja opened a cobbler station in Bordeaux, where customers could have any sneaker brand refurbished. Then, in July 2021, they set up a shoe and sneaker repair space at Galeries Lafayette in Paris. In July 2022, the Veja store in Berlin became the first to offer in-store shoe repairs, followed by Madrid. And now, There are five in-store repair shops worldwide, including one in Williamsburg, which opened last year, plus dedicated Veja General Stores in Paris and Marseille, where you can purchase items related to shoe care but also books on repair, toolboxes, and items to take better care of your clothes and plants, among other things. Since the program’s launch, a total of 40,000 pairs of shoes have been repaired, with 700 given a new life in Brooklyn alone.\n\n“We've done as much as we can to make the barrier to entry as low as possible because we want every possible sneaker to stay on the road and out of a landfill,” says Lyle Kokiko, the cobbler at Veja’s Brooklyn store since November 2024. He’ll work on anywhere from thirteen to twenty-one pairs a week, with resoling being the most common request, followed by repairing a shoe’s heel lining, as people tend to slip their shoes on and off without untying them. The former costs $50 and the latter around $10. A full makeover, which includes cleaning, could be up to $90. The current wait time averages around 4-5 weeks. However, this varies heavily with demand and type of service needed.\n\nIt’s not exactly a lucrative business, and most shoe brands wouldn’t want to discourage their customers from buying more pairs. But Veja is dedicated to both using organic and recycled materials for its sneakers and allowing them to stay in use for as long as possible—a key step that is arguably a better alternative to recycling. As founders Sébastien Kopp and François-Ghislain Morillion like to say: “The most sustainable thing you can do is wear the sneakers you already own.”",

However, when I heard Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis would be reprising their mother-daughter roles in a Freaky Friday reboot inventively titled…Freakier Friday, I knew immediately just how seated I would be for said film.\n\nWhile Freakier Friday isn’t out in theaters until August 8, we’ve officially been blessed with a trailer as of this Friday (shrewd release date on Disney’s part, IMO).

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, Vogue, it's Amanda Seyfried,\n\nand I'm gonna show you how I get ready,\n\nand I'm gonna do a pretty basic go-to makeup look.\n\nFirst step, drinking my celery juice.\n\nApparently that's what you do.\n\nYou might be thinking, what's that on her face?\n\nThat's my eczema, and I too suffer from perioral dermatitis.\n\nI'm gonna wash my face with something\n\nthat I've been using forever.\n\nNot only is it a great bar soap for your face,\n\nbut it's also a GD heart.\n\nWhen I was 19, I started developing the rash,\n\nand I learned about a lot of medicated products.\n\nI learned a lot about just products in general\n\nfrom my dermatologist at the time.\n\nAnd the rash is screaming, but that's okay,\n\nbecause I'm gonna cover it\n\nso I can go out in public. [laughs]\n\nIt's funny how eczema makes you feel.\n\nSo two years ago,\n\nI had another flare up and I cut out dairy.\n\nBoy, it was hard.\n\nBye-bye, cappuccinos, black coffee all the way.\n\nYou know, I can't wake up and not have coffee,\n\nso I also have coffee here.\n\nThis, don't worry.\n\nI'm using this medicated cream\n\nfor this little cutie mustache.\n\nNow I'm gonna use toner, Tonique Comfort, Confort.\n\nIt's French.\n\nI'll never be able to say it right.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in my hands.\n\nMy skin has gotten better over the years.\n\nI've noticed it is a little better after kids.\n\nI eat better than I ever have.\n\nI mean, the celery juice must be doing something, right?\n\nVersine Serum, Creme Serum.\n\nAnd all of this does go over the medicine,\n\nbecause the medicine penetrates first.\n\nI've just always really been into\n\nthis boosted contouring eye balm.\n\nI learned about how important specifically eye cream is\n\nfor under our eyes.\n\nIt's just such thin skin\n\nand you just gotta take care of your eyes,\n\nso even in the morning I use the eye cream.\n\nAnd then, of course, you cannot forget SPF,\n\nthe Lancome Renergie Peptide Cream.\n\nBut SPF is really important,\n\nand we know that now more than ever.\n\nThe neck is important too. Don't forget the neck.\n\nSkincare done.\n\nI'm gonna curl my lashes,\n\nbecause my eyelashes, I'll have you know, are straight.\n\nYeah, it's a bummer.\n\nI don't let other people do it\n\nbecause they sometimes pinch my eyelids.\n\nI'm also gonna put this lip balm on.\n\nThis one, it's giving youth.\n\nIt just gives a tint, and a hit of like, pink.\n\nIt gives a hint of health. [laughs]\n\nAt home, I don't use foundation,\n\nbecause I don't know how to properly apply it,\n\nand that's okay.\n\nWe don't need to.\n\nBut this, I can't live without, this Teint Idole concealer.\n\nI thought I had misplaced it the other day\n\nwhen I went to the airport,\n\nand I almost had a meltdown internally\n\nwhen I needed to cover this guy.\n\nI also have really red eyelids\n\nand you would think I'd wanna cover those up,\n\nbut it's like natural eyeshadow, so I'm gonna embrace it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\n'cause I realized over the years\n\nI know what works on my face and what doesn't,\n\nand I also am like pretty low maintenance\n\nand I don't like a lot of steps.\n\nSo I was just able to cultivate, like,\n\nthis routine over the years.\n\nYou see how easy that was?\n\nI don't need to get rid of all the redness.\n\nI wouldn't know how to even try.\n\nBut this is not a red carpet look,\n\nthis is me doing my makeup to look pretty and clean.\n\nThe next thing I'm gonna do is my eyebrows.\n\nHuh! Eyebrows. [laughs]\n\nWhat a concept.\n\nThey've changed over the years.\n\nYes, I too over-plucked, because I was born in '85,\n\nand it's taken decades to grow them back.\n\nSo Anastasia was one of the first places I went in LA\n\nin my twenties and that's where I learned about eyebrows.\n\nRight now I'm like really loving this because it's easy.\n\nI can just use the wand and they paint\n\nthe lighter colored wands and make it all more uniform,\n\nand that's what I'm looking for.\n\nAnd I'm looking for thickness,\n\nbecause they are growing back,\n\nand they're growing back well, but there's some holes.\n\nYou're just painting them.\n\nWhen I was on As the World Turns, which is a soap opera,\n\nI remember feeling embarrassed to go to set\n\nbecause I felt like I just wasn't used\n\nto seeing my face covered in so much foundation and powder\n\nthat I almost like, my face would crack a little bit,\n\nand as a 15-year-old, that's scary,\n\nbut I look back and I'm like, that's TV makeup.\n\nAnd I looked really cute.\n\nLike, I didn't look ugly,\n\nI just felt ugly because I was a teenager,\n\nand that's just, that's what we do.\n\nSo now I'm gonna put the Anastasia gel on\n\nto hold it in place, 'cause I don't know about you,\n\nbut when I leave the house\n\nand I like put a sweater on or sweatshirt,\n\nI always put it over my face and it messes with my brows.\n\nI'll put a little bit more of this on.\n\nGoing from the soap operas that I had done\n\nto Mean Girls happened so randomly and so fast\n\nthat I was just going with the flow\n\nand I was just happy to be working.\n\nI knew how lucky I was,\n\nbut we didn't quite know how big that movie was gonna be.\n\nAlthough that sounds really sad,\n\nit kinda helped prepare me for the rejection\n\nthat every actor has.\n\nThe thing that I never understood was blush\n\nand it took me until my mid-thirties to discover the blush.\n\nIt's the secret weapon.\n\nIt's incredible!\n\nLike, I don't have rosy cheeks, unless I'm freezing.\n\nMonika Blunder is another beautiful makeup artist\n\nthat I've been working with since I was, since Mamma Mia!\n\nI'm obsessed with this Liquid Flush.\n\nIt looks like moisturizer,\n\nbut it's the most beautiful color.\n\nI put it on my hand.\n\nThis one is Salzburg, this one is my favorite.\n\nI just wrapped a movie in Budapest. It's a musical.\n\nI don't know how to describe the experience\n\nof shooting Ann Lee, the musical.\n\nIt is unlike anything else I've ever done,\n\nand it's unlike anything I think anyone's ever seen.\n\nI just wrapped Long Bright River,\n\nwhich is the show that's coming out on Peacock,\n\nand that was a lot,\n\nand I didn't have time to do my voice lessons,\n\nwhich I always do.\n\nWhen I was pregnant,\n\nI was doing them three times a week on Zoom,\n\nbut it was okay because the singing wasn't so technical.\n\nIt was more about using my, like, feeling the human.\n\nI'm singing through suffering, I'm singing through joy.\n\nI had to move my body in ways that I wouldn't normally\n\nwhen I'm recording a song, so, you'll see.\n\nThe most important thing since day one\n\nof learning how to do makeup is mascara for me,\n\nbecause I have blonde eyelashes,\n\nand so does my son, that poor boy,\n\nand when I was shooting Limited Too,\n\nI shot Limited Too with Leighton Meester, by the way.\n\nNot a lot of people know that.\n\nEverybody was so pretty and I was just so awkward,\n\nand I had braces at one point,\n\nand I remember going to the bathroom and putting mascara on,\n\nbecause no one was putting mascara on me 'cause I was a kid\n\nand I felt ugly.\n\nThat poor little girl,\n\n'cause I look back at these pictures, they're so beautiful.\n\nLike, we all looked so happy and youthful,\n\nand it goes to show like the pressure we put on ourselves\n\nat such a young age.\n\nAnd, God, my role as a mother is just like to pay attention\n\nto what my girl especially is going through,\n\nbecause she's older\n\nand I just wanna make sure she feels protected\n\nand she feels beautiful,\n\nand it doesn't have to do with the length\n\nor color of your eyelashes or eyebrows.\n\nIt's more about us and less about what the world is seeing.\n\nFlutter Extension Idole Mascara. It's new.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nThis is the matte lipstick, which I love,\n\nbecause I honestly, I don't put it all over my lips.\n\nI learned on a shoot once in London\n\nthat you can smudge the matte\n\nand it looks actually way cooler.\n\nSo I'm gonna do this a little bit, and go like this.\n\nI love a red lip at night.\n\nFor the daytime, I don't wanna scare people.\n\nSometimes when you rub your lips,\n\nthey look a little plump.\n\nDo I look like I'm going to the prom? No.\n\nBut I could totally go glam grocery shopping,\n\nand I can also just go out to lunch and I look clean.\n\nThe last thing I do,\n\nwhich is actually really fun because I am super translucent,\n\nis my friend Roxy, who I work with very often,\n\nshe made this Bronze Glow Mist.\n\nThis is just giving health.\n\n[can hisses]\n\nThat's it.\n\nIt's a color,\n\nand it looks like you've just been to the beach.\n\nMy hair was done, like, full disclosure,\n\nDJ Quintero did my hair yesterday.\n\nFruit press.\n\nIt's giving, she didn't just wake up,\n\nbut I swear to God, haven't brushed it.\n\nI have good hair, I'm gonna admit it,\n\nI know I have good hair,\n\nbut with good hair comes eczema, you know,\n\nit's gotta balance out the scales.\n\nThank you.",

        "title": "8 Best Collagen Face Masks For Plump, Hydrated Skin",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Any conversation I have about skincare manages to involve collagen in some way. Am I taking my collagen powder to support my complexion from within? Have I tried that new Korean collagen coffee yet? Should I be using the best collagen face masks for firmer, glowier skin?\n\nThese are just a few of the questions I’m posed on a daily basis. By becoming a beauty editor, I by no means expected to become a purveyor of all things collagen—but I get it. In recent years, It’s become quite clear that collagen is integral to maintaining a youthful complexion. It makes up about 30% of our body's total proteins, and because these reserves diminish as we age, the cosmetics world has been researching how we can replenish them.\n\nVogue’s Favorite Collagen Face Masks\n\nCollagen, as an ingredient, feels akin to a sort of beauty fountain of youth. The more you have, the better you can look (as it’s wildly perceived). When it comes to getting more of it, experts often recommend eating it—see the aforementioned powders and ingestibles. However, we’re seeing increased supply and demand of topical collagens, too. Searches for collagen skin-care in various forms are up upwards of 40% according to our metrics, and I have been noticing more collagen-infused products landing in the Vogue beauty closet. Biodance’s collagen mask was the first product of its kind that I tried and loved. It gave me the baby-soft skin of dreams, and I continue to use it weekly nearly a year after initially testing it.\n\nBut what stuck out to me was that the protein is not easily absorbed into skin due to its high molecular weight. “Contrary to popular belief, these masks are not actually going to stimulate collagen production,” dermatologist Dr. Mina Amin, MD explained. But why are we into topical collagen if it can’t really be absorbed by skin? Part of it is marketing, sure, but it’s also the other ingredients that come with the formulas. All of our favorites are also packed with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, peptides, squalane, and niacinamide, which per Dr. Amin “allows for topical application of hydrating ingredients for a prolonged period of time.”",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHello, Vogue.\n\nI'm Cate Blanchett, and this is My Life in Looks.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music]\n\nI'm a little nervous, but je ne regrette rien, right?\n\nOh, my giddy aunt.\n\nI think I'm wearing my mother's sweater,\n\nand it looks like my school shirt.\n\nI'm probably also wearing the underpants\n\nthat my mother made me.\n\nUntil about 10 years ago,\n\nI still had the underpants that my mother sewed.\n\nClearly not wearing any makeup.\n\nGod bless me, I look like I'm 12,\n\nbut this was at the Sydney Theater Critics Awards,\n\nand I won Best Newcomer.\n\nI was in a production of Oleanna,\n\nand then I loved it so much, I ran the company.\n\nI think I might've come straight from rehearsals.\n\nClearly, I didn't realize\n\nI was gonna be photographed or win.\n\nNext.\n\nOh, look, this is the very first time I went\n\nto the Academy Awards.\n\nI had done a shoot in Australia,\n\nand I'd fallen in love with this dress\n\nthat John Galliano had designed that was knitted,\n\nwhite knitted, and was embellished\n\nwith all of this amazing embroidery,\n\nand I met him in London\n\nand he said that he would design something for me,\n\nand he said, Let's change the color.\n\nAnd he sat down, it was like being on the couch,\n\nand he asked about my family and my marriage,\n\nand then he embellished, I think you can just see it\n\nat the bottom there, there's a little hummingbird,\n\nand there's two hummingbirds on the dress,\n\nand one was me, and one was my husband Andrew.\n\nso there's kind of a real beautiful story.\n\nI gave it to amfAR,\n\nso now someone else is wearing it, sadly. [laughs]\n\nBut anyway, I love that dress so much.\n\nOh, an A for effort.\n\nThis is me at the BAFTAs. I played Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nWhen we made the film, we actually thought,\n\nwe'll have to take the first off there,\n\nbecause maybe an audience would think\n\nthere was a sequel coming, that it was Elizabeth Part One,\n\nbut it was Elizabeth I, and I'm glad I'm wearing a slip.\n\nI mean, you just take the slip off,\n\nI guess you could wear that today.\n\nAm I an early adopter of that?\n\nNo, or am I holding something? I have got my glasses on.\n\nOh, this was a dress that Jean Paul Gaultier designed.\n\nMy father-in-law, who's no longer with us,\n\ncalled it an exit dress.\n\nHe said people don't think much when you come into the room,\n\nbut when you leave, they go, wow.\n\nThere was obviously a lot of jewelry Jean Paul Guttier\n\nhad put on the dress, but Cynthia Bach then provided\n\nall of the amazing pieces.\n\nI was playing a psychic in Savannah\n\nin a small film called The Gift with Sam Raimi,\n\nand I had never been to a psychic,\n\nand I got her to do a reading for me,\n\nand she made some predictions, wild predictions.\n\nI'd play a writer who had short hair\n\nwho died for what she believed in, Guavin Guevin.\n\nI played Veronica Guerin,\n\nand she said that I would wear a dress\n\nthat was gonna change my career, and then I wore that.\n\nI don't know if it's changed my career,\n\nbut I'm very pleased I wore it.\n\nOh, bless.\n\nNow, that is my own hair,\n\nand that's just me on a Sunday morning in the pond.\n\nNext, in a little-known film called Lord of the Rings,\n\nplaying Galadriel.\n\nI did have someone I deeply respect say to me,\n\nLook, they're making this weird film in New Zealand,\n\nand they want you to play an elf for three weeks.\n\nYou don't wanna do that, do you?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nAfter the film was over, my husband,\n\nhe's fallen out of the habit,\n\nhe sort of does it to the children now,\n\nbut he used to drag me around by my ears.\n\nIt was playful, and so I told the guys at Weta\n\nwho did all of the prosthetics this,\n\nand they gave me, it was kind of creepy,\n\na chocolate box full of ear tips\n\nthat they'd made to look like chocolates,\n\nand then they bronzed my ears\n\nso I could give 'em to my husband.\n\nThat is me on the set of The Aviator,\n\nwhich Martin Scorsese directed.\n\nI think it's between takes.\n\nI was playing Catherine Hepburn.\n\nOne of the more daunting things I've ever done,\n\nbut when Scorsese asks you to do anything,\n\nI'd be a tree for him.\n\nThat was the first time I worked with the great Sandy Powell\n\non the costumes, and my relationship with costume designers,\n\nI've realized over time,\n\nis really pivotal to creating a character,\n\nand obviously, even before you utter a word,\n\nan audience is gonna start reading your character\n\nby what they wear and how they wear it,\n\nand something that Marty did,\n\nhe liberated me from having to do any imitation of Hepburn.\n\nHe played a lot of those early screwball comedies she did,\n\nand Bringing Up Baby was one of them, so I watched that.\n\nCatherine Hepburn is so raked thin,\n\nand then you don't plan for these things,\n\nand then the film got nominated, and I did,\n\nand so I had to do a lot of red carpets pregnant,\n\nand Donna Karan made me this amazing stretchy dress\n\nthat really celebrated the fact I was pregnant.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is back in 2006 for Vogue.\n\nIt's a very memorable shoot.\n\nTonne Goodman styled it, and Steven Klein shot it.\n\nThe clothes were insane.\n\nI mean, this one was another Galliano.\n\nThe pose was really difficult to hold,\n\nand I learned so much about making a picture working\n\nwith Steven Klein and Tonne on this shoot.\n\nNext.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this was the first time I went to the Met Ball,\n\nand I went with Nicolas Ghesquiere\n\nwhen he was at Balenciaga.\n\nSo we just shot with Irving Penn that day,\n\nand Nicolas had done his take on an Elizabethian garment,\n\nand then we went straight from there,\n\nwe had to do a quick 360 and then show up to the Met Ball.\n\nThe theme was Poiret: King of Fashion.\n\nI mean, I just went to the exhibition\n\nand could have stayed there.\n\nIt's always so great.\n\nI mean, the room is really vibrant, of course,\n\nbut it's always important to remember the exhibition\n\nand the reason why you're there.\n\nOkay, next one. [gasps] There we go.\n\nHere is the photograph that Irving Penn took,\n\nand this was in Penn's studio.\n\nThe taking of the picture was incredibly quick,\n\nbut the sitting and preparing,\n\nit's like I've had the great fortune\n\nof being photographed by Penn and by Avedon.\n\nIt's all about their regard\n\nand knowing when to press the shadow,\n\nand so to be beheld by him was just unforgettable.\n\nThis was the second time I played Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Elizabeth: Golden Age.'\n\nThe costumes were designed by Alexandra Byrne.\n\nI mean, she referenced a lot of haute couture,\n\nand there were a lot of Balenciaga references,\n\nand she made one dress that was so enormous,\n\nI couldn't fit through the doorway of the cathedral\n\nthat we were shooting in. [laughs]\n\nHello, Bob.\n\nI've worked with the great Todd Haynes a couple of times,\n\nand I hope I get to do it a couple of times more.\n\nHe's so fantastic to work with.\n\nI had literally walked off the set\n\nof playing Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Queen Elizabeth: The Golden Age on a Friday, wrapped,\n\nand then had to be on set playing Bob Dylan\n\nin Montreal on Monday.\n\nTodd had divided Bob's persona, Bob, like I know him,\n\nDylan's persona into many different characters,\n\nand the late, great Heath Ledger was one of them,\n\nand Christian Bale. and I played this electric silhouette.\n\nI think he wanted a woman inside this period\n\nof Dylan's musical career.\n\nIt meant that there was a separation between\n\nhow iconic this period and this look of Dylan's was\n\nand the character playing,\n\n'cause you know there's a woman inside that,\n\nbut it was so liberating.\n\nI had fantastic eyebrows and sideburns.\n\nWas that the only time my husband hasn't wanted to kiss me?\n\nOh, this is from Carol, a Todd Haynes film.\n\nI played alongside the wonderful Rooney Mara,\n\nand that coat was a nightmare.\n\nSandy Powell did the costumes again, and once again,\n\nI mean, she can do an enormous,\n\nwe worked together on Cinderella with unbelievable costumes\n\nwith a much bigger budget,\n\nand then we had $2.50 to pull this one together,\n\nand she had two coats, and one was great and stable,\n\nand this one was like a little fragile creature\n\nthat kept falling apart, and I said,\n\nI'm really sorry, Sandy. I think it's that one.\n\nAnd she goes, I know, I knew you were gonna say that.\n\nSo Sandy, the great Sandy Powell,\n\nwas literally behind the car in between every take,\n\n'cause we had to get out, and it was really windy,\n\nand the coat would come apart,\n\nand so she was there in between takes sewing it up.\n\nI felt a responsibility for this for sure,\n\nbecause films like this, up to this point,\n\nweren't really made and certainly not made\n\nin the mainstream, and really,\n\nif anyone comes up to me in the supermarket,\n\nthis is the film that they talk about,\n\nand so it was really, really important to a lot of people.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is Sarah Burton when she was at McQueen,\n\nand it was the most exquisite piece of embroidery.\n\nThe bottom, you can't really see there,\n\nbut it was all feathers.\n\nso I love that dress so much that then, during COVID,\n\nI presided over the jury in Venice, and there was no time.\n\nAll the ateliers were closed, so I said,\n\nCould I borrow that piece of embroidery again?\n\nAnd then I had a pair of pants and wore it,\n\nbecause I thought, when you have something\n\nso beautiful like that, it's a crime to wear it once.\n\nIt's even more beautiful in person.\n\nThe year I was nominated for Blue Jasmine\n\nat the Golden Globes,\n\nMr. Armani had designed this beautiful preve dress.\n\nIt was an impossible gown,\n\nand you didn't really see the back,\n\nbecause it goes right down to this plunging base.\n\nThe back is bare, and this beautiful lace,\n\nwhich has become quite signature,\n\nI was at on the jury in Cannes,\n\nand I wore it to the opening night,\n\nand I remember people saying to my publicist, [laughs]\n\nOkay, Kate's wearing the-\n\nShe's worn that dress before, as if I didn't know.\n\nOh, really?\n\nAnd I was so pleased to wear it again\n\nbecause I'd loved it so much.\n\n[gasps] Sarah Burton, there she is in Cannes.\n\nSarah made this beautiful, it was like a tuxedo,\n\nbut it was a dress, and had this massive bow on the back,\n\nand it was actually shown on the runway as a jacket,\n\nand she said, why don't I try and turn it into a dress?\n\nAnd so I love that, and I wore that again\n\nto Sarah's final show for McQueen.\n\nHere we are back at the Venice Film Festival,\n\nand this is a Schiaparelli flummery\n\nwhich I'd seen on the runway and absolutely loved\n\nand managed not to poke myself in the eye with it.\n\nThis was an example on Tar\n\nof the character coming to life, really.\n\nThe script by Todd Field was just,\n\nhe didn't change a syllable,\n\nit was so exquisitely wrought and written.\n\nIt was like, how do you make a female conductor look,\n\nsomeone who was in incredibly powerful\n\nand very, very aware of her presence?\n\nAnd so we went for this,\n\nI guess what has been termed quiet luxury look,\n\nreally great tailoring.\n\nI've had a couple of experiences in my life\n\nwhere I've just been so in sync with a director\n\nand a script, and you're lucky if you have one\n\nof those experiences in your life,\n\nbut I've had a handful of them, and I'm so grateful,\n\nand Tar was definitely one of them.\n\nMusic has come back into my life in a really major way,\n\nand that's because of this experience.\n\nHere we are. This is Armani Prive.\n\nThis is the dress that just keeps on giving,\n\nThat was from the current Prive collection, and I said,\n\nLook, I know there's this leftover lace from the dress\n\nthat I'd worn to the Globes all those years before,\n\nand they found an offcut,\n\nand so they made the internal corset out of that offcut.\n\nIt's felt great, and I've since worn it again\n\nwith the actual piece that goes underneath it,\n\nand I wanted to wear it with a T-shirt,\n\nbut Mr. Armani wouldn't let me.\n\nYou gotta respect the maestro, right?\n\n[gasps] Oh, hey. Well this is an oldie but a goodie.\n\nWith my first paycheck as an actor,\n\nI bought an Armani suit, and this is it,\n\nand I wear it wherever I can,\n\nand I think we were there in Milan for a Prive show.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, well, this is at Cannes,\n\nand this is the incomparable Nicolas Ghesquiere.\n\nIt's a particular type of beading,\n\nso the dress is incredibly heavy,\n\nbut such is his mastery that he makes it look so light,\n\nand the shoulders are really big.\n\nIn the hands of someone else, could look really solid,\n\nbut then he's got that beautiful drape,\n\nbut yeah, I can't wait to wear this one again.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThis is Brandon Maxwell.\n\nI'm going to Good Morning America.\n\nLooking so good. Did my own hair and makeup, right?\n\nHave that time in the morning.\n\nI love a Canadian tuxedo, double denim, triple denim,\n\nand this wasn't actually denim, it was more like a velvet,\n\nso it was really comfy and cozy.\n\nOh, once again, this is also for Borderlands,\n\nand I'm obsessed with this Swedish designer.\n\nShe's taken sustainable dressing to a whole new level\n\nand seamed this piece that was a dress all done in spoons.\n\nUnderneath this is kind of a cotton netting\n\ninto which she put the spoons on when you get dressed\n\nand it's backless, and then she put some spoons\n\nonto sort of a suit that I wore\n\nfor the Disclaimer premiere in Toronto for the festival.\n\nI mean, it was a crazy bonkers COVID film that I made.\n\nI really love the films of Jodorowsky,\n\nand there was one film of his\n\nwhere they were all in the desert,\n\nand the character has these incredible fingerless gloves.\n\nI thought it'd be good to have something on your hand\n\nin a close-up.\n\n[gasp] Oh, this is the 2024 Rumours premiere\n\nat the New York Film Festival,\n\nand I'd seen this, and I just thought it was hilarious.\n\nIt's Fiorucci, I think.\n\nI wear those leather pants every Wednesday.\n\nMy favorite pair of leather pants.\n\nYeah, it's a bit my Cousin Itt look.\n\nNot breathable, and don't go near me with a naked flame.\n\nThis is the thing,\n\nwhen you think about re-wearing something, you think,\n\nhow could I wear it?\n\nIt would kind of be cool as a skirt.\n\nBlack Bag.\n\nWorking again with Steven Soderbergh,\n\none of the most stylish filmmakers around,\n\nand Alan Mirojnick, who is one\n\nof the greatest costume designers, and I play a spy,\n\nand the only thing Steven said to me is, I want big hair.\n\nIt's a great film, and really fantastic cast.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music] [pen scratching]\n\nThanks, Vogue. That wasn't so painful after all.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music continues]",

The singer, who makes several trips to her favorite Italian restaurant every week, makes the walk from the Merc to the dining room her runway.\n\nWe know Rihanna is the master of high-low dressing, often mixing luxury labels with sportswear, ladylike bags with more androgynous silhouettes, fuzzy coats and sneakers. This week, the Fenty founder pulled out a more subversive accessorizing moment that elevated some more casual attire.\n\nLast night (March 21), she stepped out to probably have her usual—half-portions of ravioli with ricotta cheese, gnocchi, and spaghetti pomodoro with basil—at Giorgio Baldi, wearing an oversized black Balanciaga jacket, loose blue jeans, and pointed burgundy pumps. All simple and understated, so far. But it wouldn’t be a Rih fit without adding some outre accessories. This time, she doubled up on ultra-rare handbags: Chanel’s Double Twin Bags. The medium and small-sized quilted, single flap bags with the gold tone metal cc logo twist locks connect at the handle. She also wore a pair of oversized, orange-lensed Tom Ford sunglasses.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nI can't be a Bon Jovi without good Italian food.\n\n[gentle elegant music]\n\nHi, everyone, it's Millie Bobby Brown\n\nand I am with Vogue today\n\nto serve not only a look, but actually a meal.\n\nI'm wearing a Dolce Archive.\n\nWho? Me.\n\nYeah, the ingredients for my paella are one pepper,\n\none onion, some garlic, chorizo, cubed chicken,\n\ncanned tomatoes, Arborio rice, saffron, and chicken stock.\n\nAnd then some spices, paprika, chili flakes,\n\ndepending on how spicy you like it.\n\nFirst, I thank the culinary gods.\n\nI say, Millie, you are gonna do\n\na great job today no matter what,\n\ndon't pressure on yourself.\n\nI'm gonna start off by dicing [giggles] some garlic.\n\nMy dad's a really good cook.\n\nMy mom doesn't really cook and my mom is here.\n\nShe's probably gonna be saying,\n\nI make a really good spaghetti bolognese.\n\nBut Mom, that's the only thing that you cook.\n\nDad has various different ingredients\n\nand he can just whip something up that makes total sense,\n\nbut you'd never think you'd put together.\n\nSo I learned probably from my dad.\n\nWe're gonna take this ring off.\n\nIt's all getting really serious.\n\nChop, chop, chop away. Get it really small.\n\nI hate the way when you chop garlic and you smell your...\n\nOoh, like I can't stand it.\n\nSo usually this is Jake's job. That feels about right.\n\nMy least favorite part of cooking.\n\nSometimes I cry, sometimes just I'm really hardcore.\n\nLet's see what happens today.\n\nBut let's really hope not\n\n'cause I've got a really strong eye look going on\n\nand I know people on here are gonna say,\n\nWhat are you doing cutting an onion like that?\n\nAnd I'm gonna say, I don't know what I'm doing,\n\nso I'm just gonna go in chop away.\n\nGuys, if you're ever wanting something\n\nto get just a tiny bit smaller\n\nand you're cooking, do my trick.\n\nOh, God. Do my trick.\n\nYou just...\n\n[knife chops]\n\nIt's such a great trick.\n\nIn my house, I put a big bowl on the table\n\nand I put all the leftovers and feed it to my chickens.\n\nThey love it.\n\nI have five hens. They are great.\n\nThey're all named off to the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich I heard Chappell Roan has chickens that are named\n\nafter the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich for me just feels like a segue\n\ninto a really close friendship.\n\nMy chickens, I had from babies, I raised them.\n\nI was actually told they were gonna die\n\nand then all of them survived.\n\nSo it's the power of love in Chappell Roan, I guess.\n\nChappell, if you're watching this,\n\nknow that our chickens could get along.\n\nPosh would like to meet Posh 2.0.\n\nOkay, I'm in a pretty good place\n\nwhere the onion is really diced.\n\nMy pepper, right down. Cut the head off.\n\nTake the inside. This is the part my chickens love the most.\n\nAlways save that part.\n\nI was full when I left Spain,\n\nso it's always been a part of my life.\n\nMy first memory ever,\n\nI had like a toy car that I would drive.\n\nIt was like a very small, you know, baby toy car.\n\nWe lived on a hill and in Spain, my dad can confirm\n\nor deny this, but I lost control\n\nand I was going down the hill and my dad was chasing\n\nafter me and like, I think that was my first memory.\n\nI was like a really clumsy kid.\n\nSo I would fall a lot, chip my teeth, slip my head open.\n\nYou know, it's all added to the creativity of\n\nwho I am today though,\n\nIt's all made me smarter.\n\nAt least that's what my mom tells me.\n\nSo I'm like actually getting shit done.\n\nWhereas usually I am on the phone\n\nwith my girlfriends dying laughing at some TikTok.\n\nAre we done with that? [sighs] Oh, my God, the chorizo.\n\nOkay, I hate, hate, hate cooking meat.\n\nLike it's my least favorite part of any cooking experience.\n\nAgain, leave that to my husband.\n\nBut here we are today,\n\nMillie has to overcome her fears.\n\nFYI, I don't usually do this,\n\nso I'm gonna cut that like that\n\nand then I'm just gonna open it like that.\n\nUgh, that feels right to me.\n\nNow it's just looking weird. Let's chop it up.\n\n[knife chops]\n\nActually the smell is so delicious.\n\nI do slice it 'cause I don't like...\n\nMy dad also is the same.\n\nWe don't like it to be too big\n\nand I usually just pile them on top just\n\nto make it go faster.\n\nSo we're now at a place where we have our diced veggies.\n\nWe have that, that thing.\n\nAnd we're going to use the stove now. Let's do it.\n\nLet's make magic happen. Voila.\n\nNow we have my stove.\n\nSo what I like to do is I like to start off\n\nby turning it on, medium heat, put some oil in.\n\nI will put my onions in, put my garlic in,\n\nand I'm gonna throw my saffron in the chicken stock\n\nto bloom it while I'm cooking.\n\nNow I'm going to add some salt.\n\nFor me, I loved baking in COVID\n\nand until I smell like it's walking,\n\nthen I kind of, that incentivizes me to keep going.\n\nIt starts to smell bad. That's when we put a roadblock.\n\nI'm very much just like go with the flow, just keep tasting\n\nas I go along and see if it needs more of anything.\n\nI'm gonna let this caramelized.\n\nAnytime anyone wants to kind of go out for dinner,\n\nI'm always like, Come over, and it feels more intimate.\n\nAnd it actually, I feel like my love for food is like a way\n\nof saying like, Thank you for coming over.\n\nSo now I'm just gonna throw in the red pepper.\n\nI'm gonna start with my least favorite part,\n\nwhich is cooking the meat.\n\nI have a very bad irrational fear\n\naround raw chicken and some might say,\n\nMillie, go be a vegetarian.\n\nAnd I'm gonna say to that, Yeah, I was a vegetarian\n\nfor a really long time, but I found out my body needs meat.\n\nEverybody's different.\n\nAnd that's what was happening with me.\n\nWe have olive oil, we have the chicken.\n\n[chicken sizzling]\n\nOnce it's cooked, I usually leave it in the bowl.\n\nI don't eat it. That's Jake always\n\nwhen we're like cleaning up after he goes,\n\nYou haven't even touched it.\n\nSo why do we put it in there?\n\nAnd I'm like, I know, I do this every time.\n\nBut it's for the enjoyment of my other guests.\n\nI want everybody else to enjoy the chicken,\n\nI just seemingly can't.\n\nWe're gonna add some salt and pepper.\n\nThis is my paprika.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in now to give some\n\nof the veggies some flavor.\n\nI mean, I was on Hell's Kitchen.\n\nYeah, that's right. I was the idiot sandwich.\n\nNo, I was a guest on there when I was like nine.\n\nI love Gordon. I love his whole family.\n\nOh, but Stanley Tucci's a good chef,\n\nbut I've never tried his food.\n\nSo invite me over, Stanley.\n\nAll right, something's happening.\n\nIt's definitely turning a different color.\n\nNext, we're going to add in that chorizo.\n\nSo here we go.\n\n[chorizo sizzling]\n\nI'm just gonna put in like not all of it.\n\nAnd I really like the chorizo really crispy.\n\nSo this is the part where I take the most time\n\nand make sure that it's like really crispy and delicious.\n\nNext, I'm gonna put in [giggles] my canned tomatoes.\n\nI'm just gonna pop this in.\n\nAnd this actually helps soften the vegetables.\n\nI just like to kind of mix this around, get it moving. Yum.\n\nJust wait, have faith in me. It's looking good.\n\nIt looks where it needs to be for me.\n\nIf you put it in the rice fast,\n\nit picks up all the flavors of the oils.\n\n[eye tinkles]\n\nWoo-hoo.\n\nI'm just gonna mix this together\n\nand I'm gonna add in chicken stock.\n\nSo I again like to do this kind of the same thing\n\nwith the paprika but do it intermittently\n\nbecause the rice really soaks up fast.\n\nAnd then you have to keep trying\n\nand make sure the rice is actually cooking\n\nand then you add more.\n\nI kind of play it by ear at this point.\n\nAnd you let the rice do the talking.\n\nNow I'm gonna put in the peas,\n\nI'm gonna put in the blooming saffron\n\nand I'm gonna put in the rest of my paprika.\n\nChef's kiss.\n\nLid is gonna go on top of this while this is cooking.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep looking at this in disappointment.\n\nThe wedding food process, I didn't do a tasting,\n\nI didn't do anything.\n\nOur caterer was Galateo, the most like renowned,\n\nbeautiful catering company in, honestly Europe.\n\nSo I was like, You got this.\n\nAnd to this day, guests at my wedding say,\n\nThere was a pasta dish that was like so amazing.\n\nWhat I really wanted the takeaway to be was\n\nthat the food was the best food\n\nthey've ever had at a wedding.\n\nAnd I am taking, taking that very proudly.\n\nI very much am not a trad wife, but I do love cooking\n\nand I love married life.\n\nI love cooking with my husband. Jake also loves the farm.\n\nHe also loves cooking like we're a trad couple,\n\nbut like a trendy trendy trad couple.\n\nSo now I'm going to pop the chicken in to the paella.\n\nProbably needs another like, honestly 15 minutes,\n\nbut we'll check like intermittently.\n\nSo what I would usually do at home is I would then go\n\nand let the dogs out, put my life jacket\n\non my English bulldog 'cause she really likes the pool,\n\nbut she doesn't realize that she can't swim.\n\nAll right, I'm gonna make you a drink. Let's do it.\n\nSo now I'm gonna show you my favorite drink,\n\nwhich is a Shirley Temple.\n\nI grew up in the industry always going to like fancy dinners\n\nand meeting fancy people.\n\nAnd to feel fancy myself, I would order a Shirley Temple.\n\nAnd now growing up and being 21,\n\nmy preference is always gonna be a Shirley Temple.\n\nI need a cold drink.\n\nLet's find like a really nice one to sit on top of that.\n\nYeah, that's what we wanna see.\n\nOkay, then I'm gonna do a splash.\n\nI like to do a squeeze of lime\n\nand then I like to fill it all the way up.\n\nOkay, I like to pop that in there.\n\nOne for me, one for the drink,\n\nand then I'm gonna use the back\n\nof a spoon just to get that grenadine.\n\nDoesn't that look so good? And guess what this doesn't do.\n\nLeave you questioning everything you did the night before.\n\nAlways choose Shirley. This is like the best drink ever.\n\nSo I'm very happy with this. Let's check the paella.\n\n[food sizzling]\n\nOh my gosh, it looks amazing.\n\nI'm gonna do a little taste test\n\nwith the same Shirley Temple spoon, just gonna...\n\nMy dad would like it, however, Jake wouldn't.\n\nSo I'm gonna pour some more of this on\n\nbecause the rice is still too hard.\n\nAnd then I'm just going to bring all\n\nof the sides into the middle.\n\nThis might be my segue into my cooking career.\n\nWe don't know, like I could be the next Stanley Tucci.\n\nWe're gonna let that do its thing again.\n\nAnd it's also gonna get crispy on the bottom,\n\nwhich is my favorite part of any paella.\n\nTas tas.\n\n[bell dings] Checking.\n\nThat's ready. All right, this is ready to be served.\n\nSo I'm gonna tidy up so we can get taste testing.\n\nAll right, we're back. I clearly had way too much fun.\n\nI'm gonna make another.\n\nThis time, I'm gonna put two cherries in.\n\nThe rest is Sprite.\n\nThe reveal. Here we go.\n\nThis is our paella. I'm gonna start in the middle.\n\nWhy not?\n\nNow I'm going to put a little bit of parsley.\n\nNot one flake went on there.\n\nA little lemon and voila, that is my paella.\n\nWow. I'm getting hints of saffron.\n\nI'm getting hints of tomato. This is delicious.\n\nGood job me.\n\nIt's all working. It's all giving.\n\nIt's all serving.\n\nMy kitchen at home does not look like this.\n\nAnd it usually has around 10 dogs running around me,\n\neating everything that falls on the ground.\n\nIt's just been a really peaceful, enjoyable experience.\n\nI love limes. You know, and Dakota's like, I love limes.\n\nI would like to take this home in memory\n\nof that amazing video.\n\nThanks so much for watching. Bye.\n\nI have a nephew and I perform popular to him.\n\nHe fully giggles and laughs\n\nat me playing Elphaba and Glinda for him.\n\nHe loves the power of Elphaba.\n\nLike he can really...\n\nHe feels it, but Glinda makes him laugh.\n\n[upbeat bright music]",

        "content": "After watching the first episode of the new Netflix hit Adolescence, I found myself in my son’s bedroom, climbing into bed next to him as he tried to read a book about the solar system. I defy any thinking, feeling person—let alone a parent—not to come away shaken by the show’s depiction of one boy’s unnoticed descent into the most toxic corners of the manosphere. As someone with a son, I felt both vulnerable and protective—hence my sliding beneath his duvet. So what can the show’s breakout star, Owen Cooper, teach me about modern masculinity, creativity and how best to protect my own boy?\n\n“I think everyone must have a creative side to them,” says Cooper, speaking to me from his hotel room on a Friday night. “Not a lot of working-class 14-year-olds do drama lessons and get out of their comfort zone in that way. But the decision you have to make is: Do you want to be bland, and try to fit in with everybody else, or do you want to do the things you want to do?”\n\nI tell him that, in the show, it seems that art—even just the simple act of drawing—is gently put forward as an alternative to the pressures of social media.\n\n“One hundred percent,” Cooper agrees. “And if you’re worried or get embarrassed, just know that everyone gets embarrassed. If I hadn’t let myself be embarrassed, then I wouldn’t be here. None of this would have happened.”",

I'm Tan France and I'm so excited to be back\n\nhere live at Vanity Fair's legendary Oscar bash, here in the heart of Beverly Hills.\n\nThe stars are pouring in to celebrate Hollywood's most iconic night as a designer. You know, I'm all about the fashion, and we\n\nalready have had the most amazing looks. There have been so many incredible ones. There's already, uh, Kelly Rowland on the red\n\ncarpet. Looks incredible. We've had Sarah Paulson, who gave us the most\n\nincredible moment. Selma Blair looked magical. Old Hollywood.\n\nUm. Oh, gosh. Who do we have here?\n\nLooking like a vision in gold. But let's kick things off. Let's really get things going with the\n\nwonderful Ben Stiller and his wife, Christine. Hi, Ben.\n\nGood to see you. Hi, Christine. Good to see you.\n\nHi. You lot. How are you?\n\nI'm so. well, I would love to really focus on you and I promise I'm going to come back.\n\nBut your wife, Christine, you look like a knockout.\n\nThank you so much. Do you get a temp check from Ben before you head out of the house?\n\nI do, you do? I feel like he's my biggest fan. Oh, I know.\n\nI mean, this is. Yeah. This was very special, though.\n\nWould you tell her if you were like, honey, I don't know. No, no no, no, I'd say that's the\n\nright answer. That is the right answer. That is the right answer.\n\nNow, can I gush real quick about severance? Oh. Thank you.\n\nNo thank you. I was obsessed with season one. I saw Adam last year, and I'm sure you get\n\nthis reaction a lot at the end of the season. One, I literally stood up from my sofa and held the TV because I couldn't believe that\n\nthat's the way you ended it. Um, the installation you did for the launch of season two was wild.\n\nGrand central station? Yes. Yeah.\n\nUm, can you tell me what the response has been from the audience for season two? It's been so exciting because we were off the\n\nair for three years, as you know. Yeah. And we had a really strong sort of almost\n\nlike a cult audience. I think for the first season, people who were so into it.\n\nBut it wasn't, I don't think, huge numbers. And then the second season, we were offered three years and we came back and somehow a\n\nlot of people discovered us, and we're really happy about that.\n\nI don't know if you know this, Ben, I think. Have you been to England much? Do you know what a tenner is?\n\nWhen I say a tenner, it means 10 pounds. Okay. You might owe me a tenner or 20.\n\nBecause I am the reason that so many people tuned in for season two. I have told everyone I know.\n\nThank you everyone, and I've said it a thousand times over. It's one of the greatest shows I've ever seen\n\nin my entire life. I loved it so much. Thank you everybody who works on the show.\n\nWe have such an amazing team of people making the show so incredible, incredible, um, I did this might be a little controversial, but I'm\n\ngoing to go here. You're one for clapping back on social.\n\nMhm. Um. Oh yeah.\n\nUh, which is really surprising. Yeah. Was it just a night I find it fun.\n\nWas it just one night thing, or are you just like, you just want to comment on what you're seeing?\n\nIt depends. It just depends what mood I'm in. By the way, you're moving your hand.\n\nI'm like, you've got an opinion. I want to hear it. No, no.\n\nDo you tell him not to? I always say do not engage. Yeah, but sometimes you feel like engaging\n\nand you give it a shot. I get, but to be honest, it's hard not to engage.\n\nYeah. Okay, on that note, go engage with everyone behind me.\n\nEnjoy your night. You both look gorgeous. Thank you.\n\nLovely. Lovely to see you. Amazing.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you, thank you. Okay.\n\nWhen it comes to pop culture, no one has their finger on the pulse. Quite like Hannah Berner and Paige Desorbo,\n\naka the Giggly Squad, who are here to chat with the stars the only way they can. Hello, ladies.\n\nWhat's going on? Hello, tan. No, the giggly squad is here.\n\nWe are so scared right now. It's a lot of yelling, but the best people watching I've ever seen.\n\nAnd let's not make her wait anymore. Amy Poehler, can you come in away from us, Amy?\n\nGet right in the middle. Tom. Get in here!\n\nOkay. Stunning. Stunning.\n\nThank you. Thank you. So, since when are women in comedy just so\n\nbeautiful? Since 2025. Since 2025.\n\nSomething happened in the planets. No. Women have always been beautiful and funny.\n\nHave you ever done anything crazy to prepare for a night like this? Ooh.\n\nLike a salmon. Salmon like facial or something. Like a mucin situation?\n\nYeah. I wish I don't do. I don't think I do enough.\n\nEvery time I like, I, you know, I ate a croissant today, which is like, I don't do enough.\n\nYou wrapped yourself in velvet, and I love that. Thank you very much.\n\nI gorgeous. I had the trifecta tonight, which never happens where I liked how.\n\nI'm just going to say I like how I look, which never happens. You can say that Timothée Chalamet say I want\n\nto be one of the greatest. You're the greatest of how you look like the Michael Jordan of this party.\n\nYes. Um, and, um, and I liked how it looked. I had fun with my date, and my feet don't\n\nhurt though. That's it. It's only going downhill from here, Amy.\n\nWhen you go in there, what are you at a party like? Are you the wallflower?\n\nI cannot wait to leave. Yeah, yeah, I get that. I cannot wait to get in there so I can do a\n\nlap and then leave. I heard they have the best food, like at this party.\n\nI saw an In-N-Out truck. Fantastic. Yeah.\n\nNow, Amy, you've had some of the most viral moments in the world. Do you feel pressure?\n\nThe whole world, at least. America. Do you feel pressure to, like, outdo your\n\nviral moments, or have you just settled with the greatness that you already have? Thank you so much for saying that.\n\nI do think award shows are kind of funny, and they should be silly and people take them very seriously.\n\nAnd I, you know, it's a big night for a lot of people. I understand they work really hard, but I do\n\nlike it when people goof around. They work hard. But I think when people goof around, it's\n\nfun. So you're saying if you won an Oscar, you wouldn't cry?\n\nI mean, I feel like I feel like I would just disassociate so much. I'm not sure I would cry, but is that the\n\nprice that like you should want? I feel like you have to shed one tear. Even if it's a fake one.\n\nJust shed one. One just a single tear. When you're getting married, if the guy\n\ndoesn't cry. Immediate divorce, divorce I get. I have a lot of feelings about men that cry\n\nat weddings. It's very strange to me. We have time to talk about it.\n\nActually, when they saw we talk about it, they haven't told us to stop yet.\n\nNo. They said. They just said, wrap it up.\n\nThey said, wrap it up. Amy, you're the best. Thank you so much, Amy.\n\nYou look beautiful. We'll send it to Andy over there.\n\nHi, kids. Here's another star lighting up the red carpet.\n\nHe's right there in the screen. Hi, Andy. Look at him.\n\nOh, a corduroy look. He's right there. She's right there.\n\nWhere are you? Holy. Should we talk?\n\nDo you know what? This interview is over. It's these two chatting to each other.\n\nHi, Andy. Good to see you. How are you?\n\nHow are you? Very well. For those who don't know.\n\nLook, I would love to focus on Andy, but I discovered last year that he is married to an icon, Joanna Newsom.\n\nThat's right. I know she couldn't be with us here today. She's hiding away.\n\nShe is. She doesn't do interviews. That's okay.\n\nBut I would like to pretend that you're her tonight. Give me what you got.\n\nHow's life? How's it treating you? Um.\n\nYou've been to this party before. What's it like being married to Andy Samberg? Uh.\n\nOh, boy. I can't answer the last one. Uh, life is beautiful.\n\nOur life is full. Uh, there's music and love flowing out of our home.\n\nI did ask you off camera if she sings around the house and you said yes. Absolutely.\n\nDo you request it, or is she just voluntarily volunteers it? I never have to request it.\n\nGood. Also, it wouldn't matter if I did. Okay, good.\n\nIt happens when? When she wants it to happen. Dream.\n\nAbsolute dream. Um, can you talk about SNL 50? Oh, yeah.\n\nTell me about it. Stressful. Exciting.\n\nCan you believe it's 50? It was stressful for me because I worked on it a lot up until it was happening, and then\n\nit was absolute joy and so much fun and being there and watching it live and seeing so many incredible stars from the history of the show\n\ninteracting and doing comedy together and Paul McCartney performing and Lil Wayne and Paul Simon and like, it was kind of like\n\nrelentlessly incredible. It was very overwhelming. It was one of the most exciting moments in TV\n\nI've seen in a really long time. And the fact that you got to be a part of it is just mind blowing.\n\nIt was cool. I met Bonnie Raitt. All right, we're gonna end there.\n\nYeah. We can't beat that. Thank you so much.\n\nI'll see you at the party. Yeah. It's untoppable.\n\nIt is what it is. Thank you. Tan.\n\nWe're joined by the one and only Vanessa Hudgens. Hi.\n\nNo. Our Lord and savior. Literally.\n\nI'll take it. Have you had any moments yet with any celebs? Like in the bathroom or anything fun in the\n\nline? Have you have you crossed paths with anyone or are you like, pretty cool because you've\n\ndone this for a long time. I mean, I feel like I've been coming here for for a good minute of everyone.\n\nNo, you're definitely not sick of everyone. I feel like the last carpet I did was literally a year ago here.\n\nWow. So, wait, when you were to be back when you were preggers, I was popping.\n\nOh my God. Should we have a baby or not? Great question, Hannah.\n\nGreat question. Yes. Okay, fine.\n\nAnd we'll do it. Yes. Well, Keke Palmer just popped one out.\n\nYou just popped one out. And you guys are, like, iconic in every way. Thank you.\n\nAre you. You do what you can. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Vanessa, also, we have to talk about your dress because it's stunning.\n\nI love a feather. I'm a big feather girl. I think they're so good.\n\nWhat's like your process when you're picking your Vanity Fair? Look, because it's different from other red\n\ncarpets. Yeah. I mean, like, I am that girl who genuinely\n\ntries on a dress, and the first one I try on is always the dress.\n\nIt's like a man. It's like a man. You gotta go with your instincts.\n\nIt's like a man. Yeah. It's dating.\n\nIf you don't know in the first 30s. It's not for you, honey. I have a controversial question.\n\nYes. Side part or middle part? I'm normally a middle part girl.\n\nI know. Tonight we're rocking. Yeah.\n\nAnd I'm so jealous cause I can't pull off a look at that. You can pull off a side.\n\nYou totally can. Believe in yourself. Okay.\n\nThank you. I didn't think I could either. But you just got to go for it.\n\nI'm making this interview about me, and I need to stop. I need to stop.\n\nSo are you. Is there any fashion look that you're kind of or trend that you're kind of over?\n\nI don't know. I mean, nothing really pops to mind.\n\nI mean, I feel like we saw a lot of, like, bigger is better moments. I mean, Cynthia's dress, that Louis Vuitton\n\nwas so iconic. I don't know how she sat. Yeah.\n\nNo, I don't know if she did. It was art. Yeah, it was art.\n\nIt was truly art. The girls are standing on business today. Yeah.\n\nVanessa, thank you so much for stopping by. We'll see you inside. Have fun and welcome back.\n\nYes. And shout out to your baby tan. Back to you.\n\nThank you. Gosh, I love it. Back to me.\n\nPeople are arriving on the carpet. Have you seen them all? They're looking incredible.\n\nWho we got? Serena Williams looking like a vision. VA VA voom has an incredible two.\n\nWho else we got on that red carpet? You know, I can barely see. I'm short sighted.\n\nHere we go. Okay, who have I got? Do you know what?\n\nNever mind. Now let's go to our fellow co-hosts, actor and filmmaker Francesca Scorsese, who's with\n\nSarah Paulson. Okay, so I'm here with Sarah Paulson. Welcome.\n\nThank you. You've worked with Ryan Murphy on so many twisted Tales.\n\nWhat is your favorite horror trope? My favorite horror trope.\n\nOh, God. You know, it's a hard question. The final girl.\n\nI always loved. The final girl. I've been the final girl a couple of times.\n\nThat's true. I'm looking forward to not being the final girl sometimes, but the final girl trope\n\nworks for me. Good. And you've done everything from horror to\n\ndrama. What genre would you like to explore that you haven't yet?\n\nOh, I'd like to do a big stinking comedy because nobody lets me do it.\n\nSince I'm wearing this dress, I feel like comedy will lend itself because, you know, go big or go home is my my motto.\n\nYeah, I love that. That's amazing. And what is the first thing that you plan to\n\ndo when you get into the party? Go straight to the bar. Amazing.\n\nAnd if anyone doesn't say that, they're a loser. Yeah, totally.\n\nI mean, I mean, for all the sober people out there. I don't mean that about you.\n\nI can just, you know, we live in a world now where I'm going to get 22 tweets about how no tweets.\n\nDoes anybody tweet anymore? Okay. I mean, yes, but blue sky, what are we doing\n\nthese days? I don't even really know. I don't even know what it's called.\n\nBlue sky. Blue sky. Sky.\n\nBlue sky. Or blue sky. I mean, I should go inside now, right?\n\nThank you so much. So much. Amazing.\n\nThank you. Kitty, Kitty.\n\nOver your shoulder.\n\nTurn to your right side.\n\nThey say.\n\nThat.\n\nLoving her. Short bang. Yep.\n\nMy face could never pull it off. I'm so jealous.\n\nLook, I mean, am I just meant to stand right next to both of you beautiful women? You guys.\n\nWe're joined by Sofia. Richie. Sofia.\n\nStunning. Thank you guys so much. You're so good.\n\nThank you. I feel like you are the trendiest girl on this carpet right now.\n\nBut you know what? I love you because I feel like you don't even want to be trendy.\n\nYou. You just do things, and then it goes into, like, you're not planning it.\n\nYeah. You know what? I'm really just waking up and living my life.\n\nBut I'm really glad that everyone's on board. No, you are the coolest one here, for sure. She put, like, conditioner on her hair cause\n\nshe was tired and everyone just copied her and was like. And now we put conditioner, coconut oil\n\nbecause my hair was greasy. Yeah. And it worked out.\n\nA lot of power comes. Great responsibility. What's the next trend?\n\nDo you think is going to be happening? Give us what are we going to do?\n\nGuys don't follow trends. That's the next trend. Don't follow a trend.\n\nSo iconic of you to say that was so iconic. Okay, I have a fashion question. Okay.\n\nYou come to a lot of these. You're always like the belle of the ball. You always get on the best dressed list.\n\nWhat's your process like? How do you know when you like a dress and when you don't?\n\nLike, what's your vibe when you're in a fitting? Like, I take a lot of photos in fittings.\n\nThat's a big part of my process. Um, other than that, it's. I have to feel comfortable.\n\nYeah. And I have to feel like a bad bee. Do you ever care what your husband thinks?\n\nOh, 100%. 100%. We've never.\n\nPaige is never asked a man anything. 100%. My husband has good taste.\n\nMy husband has really good taste. I mean, he wears glasses. He's smart so he can see better.\n\nTinted glasses. Always trust a man with tinted glasses. We love you guys.\n\nWe love both of you and your baby. Thank you. Sophia.\n\nCongratulations. Thank you for stopping by. Thank you for having me on.\n\nBack to tan. Thank you. Los Angeles is the heart of Hollywood, but\n\nthe recent wildfires have deeply impacted this city. Matt Bomer is here to share how the community\n\nis coming together to rebuild. Thank you. Tan.\n\nI am here with Courtney Bailey, who oversees fundraising for Mptf, the Motion Picture and Television Fund, which is a wonderful\n\norganization close to my heart because they're committed to helping everyone in our industry in times of need.\n\nThe recent devastation caused by the LA wildfires demonstrates how critical Mptf is to members of our community who have lost\n\neverything and who are now trying to rebuild their livelihood.\n\nAnd it's not just actors, right, Courtney? It's people behind the scenes, too, who have given their whole lives to this industry, who\n\nMptf looks after. Will you share how Mptf is taking care of people during this time of enormous need?\n\nAbsolutely. We are here to help people pay their mortgages, rent, find temporary housing,\n\nrecover important documents, basically everything to help them get back on their feet while they are still processing grief\n\nand extraordinary loss. We're also providing guidance and helping people navigate insurance claims, FEMA\n\ngrants, along with so many social services to help them cope and manage the truly enormous gravity of the situation.\n\nThat's incredible.

And if you are a member of our entertainment\n\ncommunity who needs our help, please just call our hotline at (323) 634-3888.\n\nHey, kids, can we talk fashion? I would love it. Oh my gosh, do we have a best dressed?\n\nOkay, I don't want to give any early predictions, but who do you like? No, I'm gonna say I loved Kim Kardashian.\n\nI was just about to say it, but I didn't want to be too obvious. She looked incredible.\n\nShe was giving cloud a ethereal. She was honestly giving bed vibes and I loved it.\n\nI also thought that her friend Steph Shep looked amazing. Steph.\n\nGorgeous. Gorgeous. Iconic.\n\nShe's always chic and as you would say, tan. Stunning. Stunning.\n\nAbsolutely stunning. You know who else was stunning? Who?\n\nI'm jealous that you got to speak to Nicole. Oh, well, she's just elegant in every way.\n\nSofia. Sofia. I was gonna say I got her name wrong.\n\nSofia. I was gonna roll with it. I was like, I was like, you are such a ride\n\nor die. You're such a ride. Thank you so much.\n\nI You guys, you guys have got to stop you. Are you looking at the monitor? Look at Jeff Goldblum.\n\nI mean, okay, shades on a red carpet for Jeff.\n\nLook how he's posing. Oh, I love him so much, guy. Okay, you guys, how's your first time going?\n\nThis is your first night hosting this. Are you doing okay? Holding up?\n\nThere's so much adrenaline. We took two beta blockers, and we are in it for the long haul.\n\nWe can't feel a thing right now. Beta blocker.\n\nWe wouldn't feel it. Has there been anyone that you were desperate to talk to that just passed you?\n\nThis is. Well, Serena Williams. Where is she?\n\nOh, don't get me started. She's agile. She got away.\n\nDid she? She's the fastest woman on the planet. So I think I missed her, but I heard people\n\nyelling, so I'm really upset. But I'm a tennis nerd. So that was I was.\n\nI'm obsessed with everything she does. We also we missed Julia Fox, which I'm livid about.\n\nShe did look incredible. I do love that you made a sport reference though, Hannah, as if I might know what\n\nyou're talking about, so I'm gonna have to move on real quick. Francesca's on the red carpet with Leslie and\n\nChelsea. I feel like I'm so excited. You've given me a microphone.\n\nIt's all over. Your job is going to be gone. I know.\n\nHonestly, if I could go. Okay.\n\nI'm so excited to have you guys join me. This is the lovely Chelsea Handler and Leslie Bibb.\n\nThank you. So if the two of you were to team up for a comedy show, what would it be about?\n\nOh, it would have to be some sort of road trip, right?\n\nThink Thelma and Louise. We're on a train. Like a high end train like the Orient Express\n\nor meets Midnight Run. Something like that. Yeah, I think it's Thelma and Louise meets\n\nMidnight Run. And we wouldn't have to do much acting. It would just be improvizational and just\n\nwith, like, loose, loose outlines.\n\nYes, absolutely. This would be exactly what's happening. Her talking and me laughing.\n\nThat's amazing, I love it. And Leslie, The White Lotus is all about secrets and scandals.\n\nSo if this party had a twist ending, what would it be? If this party had a surprise ending.\n\nYeah, we all die.\n\nI mean, that would be very White Lotus. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nBody. One body bag. Not one body bag.\n\nOne body bag. No one. You need Mike white.\n\nMike White I'm not a writer, but Mike white would tell you what's best. I love it.\n\nThank you both so, so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nOh, VA VA VA voom. Gabrielle Union looks absolutely stunning. Gosh, I love a column dress.\n\nAnd she looks gorgeous in that. Um, who do we have next? Who's this vision?\n\nUm, do you know that dress? Couldn't be hotter. Oh, my God, it's Cyd Sydney Sweeney.\n\nHi, baby girl. Oh, she looks absolutely beautiful when she not looked gorgeous.\n\nI've got to say, Julia Garner might be on my best dressed list for the night.\n\nI'm assuming it's Gucci because she is their brand ambassador and looks Heavenly yaskin.\n\nAnd that girl knows how to pose. Gosh that's good. Love that.\n\nI love that she's giving us texture. Christina Ricci ah, we call her Nina. Hi, Nina.\n\nUm, Christina's looking beautiful.\n\nOh, wow. Oh, and here we have Ben. Gorgeous.\n\nBen. Um, okay. Shall we get back to it?\n\nFrancesca's on the carpet with our darling Dan and Clea.\n\nLet's hit it.\n\nSo I am joined by Dan Levy and Clea Duvall. Thank you so much for being here and for talking, for having us.\n\nUm, Dan, you've mastered the art of fashion both on and off screen. How do you stay true to your personal style?\n\nI don't know, I always feel like when you try something on and you feel your best in it, that's generally what you should be going\n\nwith. But often people can put you in some pretty easy stuff.\n\nYeah. Do you think it's fashion, but if you can't wear it, there's no point.\n\nIt's all the confidence of it. So anyway, sometimes the simpler way to go is always the best.\n\nIt's true, it's true. And is there a genre or role that you've always wanted to explore that you haven't\n\nyet? Um, I mean, I'm fascinated for this answer.\n\nI the genre I'm most excited about is one that I've actually been in as an actor, but as a director, I'd really like to do horror.\n\nLove that. I would love to do horror. I love horror.\n\nI don't think anyone would take me seriously in a horror, really. I would put you in a horror movie.\n\nHorror? Yeah. Okay, great.\n\nOkay, done. Thank you. A horror film.\n\nOkay. All right, so who asked who to this event? Do you guys have, like, a kind of promposal\n\nthing? I said, Cleo, will you come to the Vanity Fair party with me in rose petals?\n\nYeah, in front of Cleo's House. I burst into tears. Into tears.\n\nWow. And I said, of course. The rest is history for us.\n\nReally? God. That's amazing.\n\nThat's so lovely. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nThank you for. Thank you for joining me. And I hope you have the best.\n\nThank you for having us.\n\nGosh, Mr. Stanfield, you have never looked more handsome. I love a Saint Laurent suit on a man.\n\nAnd I'm assuming this is his partner who is looking equally stunning. Wow.\n\nCould you imagine being a couple? That's hot. That is that hot?\n\nLike, where do you go from there? You wake up in the morning just knowing this is it.\n\nYou're perfect. Um, you guys, at some point soon, hopefully we're going to see Selena Gomez because she\n\njust rocked up and I see her in line and she's looking she's standing right behind us and we're trying to get out.\n\nI'm so jealous. I know I tried to pretend I was cool too. She looked incredible.\n\nI'm sweating just knowing she's near because I don't want her to know we're talking about her.\n\nNah. Do it. Do it.\n\nShe's wearing so many diamonds. I just burnt out my retina. And you know what?\n\nThe thing is? She's not. They're not on loan, I bet.\n\nLike she's Quincy. She can afford to keep those.\n\nYeah, those are hers. Those are just. Those are her.\n\nHer Saturday night diamonds. Not the regular. Like dishwashing diamonds.\n\nShe'll wear those in the kitchen, I'm sure. She's one of those guys. She also must be tired because she has been\n\non a press run. Do you know what? No.\n\nThat one's got so much energy. She's been doing this for years. She is trained.\n\nShe's a machine. True. I did watch her documentary.\n\nShe's been busy for a long time. Yeah. And she's not stopping anytime soon.\n\nOh, I love when men go for something fun. And they don't just do the traditional.\n\nIt's pirate chic. Pirate chic? Yeah.\n\nI love that you're calling it pirate chic. It is fully Saint Laurent. And you just referred to it as pirate chic.\n\nLOL. Saint Laurent loves a boat.\n\nSaint Laurent has been on a boat before. That's so funny. That's so funny.\n\nAll right. One of the best things about award season is getting to see a more candid, unfiltered side\n\nof Hollywood's biggest stars. Vanity Fair has been capturing such moments for some of our favorite nominees and winners\n\nall season long. They remain. They're still in the city.\n\nThe aspirations of the film really speak to me on many levels. One as an artist, as someone who wants to\n\nleave behind a body of work that is of some significance.\n\nEven distilling work in a film is similar to an architect erecting a building and creating something.\n\nThere's a foundation of work.\n\nSo joining me now is the host of this fabulous party, Vanity Fair editor in chief Radhika Jones.\n\nWelcome. Hi, Francesca. Hi.\n\nWhat is so special about tonight? Well, the Oscar party is always special. It is the end of a long season of hard work\n\nand campaigning on the part of the actors and directors and everyone who comes to the party.\n\nIt's it's such an incredible night of celebration, and it's literally the high point of many people's lives.\n\nIt's like the night that they win an Oscar, so that's great. But, you know, we're also conscious this year\n\nthat it's been a difficult start to the year for LA with the wildfires.\n\nWe are happy to be partnering with Baby to Baby and Mptf to provide help out with some wildfire relief for families and for industry\n\nprofessionals. So it feels good to be here to lift those causes up and also to celebrate some amazing\n\ntalent. That's amazing. And what does this party mean to you?\n\nI mean, well, I was thinking on the way over. This is my seventh Oscar party. Lucky seven.\n\nI know. So I think it's going to be a great night. And honestly, it's just so much fun and\n\neveryone comes in and has a wonderful time, so I'm looking forward to the same.\n\nAmazing. Thank you so much and enjoy. Thank you.\n\nAwesome. We are joined by Madison Beer, who I currently have beef with because we both have\n\nthe same good side. We're both going to talk to her like this. That's so crazy.\n\nBecause Hannah wouldn't let me stand on that side for my dress. It's a real fight.\n\nI actually need to stand like this, too. But the crazy thing is, Madison beer does not have a bad side.\n\nAnd you? You do? What are you talking about?\n\nNo. She does. No, I do.\n\nI really do. I do. She said no, you do.\n\nI Vanity Fair Vanity Fair almost fired me because of it.\n\nWait, you're you're singing. Career is blowing up. Your fashion has never been better.\n\nOh my God. What are the vibes right now? I don't know.\n\nAre you excited to be here and talking to us? Absolutely. I'm so honored that I'm here.\n\nThis is amazing. And I feel like you're so nice of you. Sorry.\n\nYou've done. No, she's really nice. She's not looking over here.\n\nSorry. I'm like. You're so nice.\n\nOh my God. I love you guys.\n\nShould we just go in and have a cocktail? I feel like we just want.\n\nOh, wait. So when you're at a party, who are you like? Are you the wallflower?\n\nAre you socializing? Are you just observing? No.\n\nI'm terrified. You're terrified the whole time. But I'm trying to be more confident just in\n\ngeneral. Even if it's, like, fake it till you make it, you know?\n\nYeah. This is how we got here. Trying really hard.\n\nYeah, we lied on our resume when we got here. It's just been fake it till you make it. Yeah.\n\nYeah, I think I'm just trying to be more confident, but internally, I'm like, who am I?\n\nWell, what's your trick when you're not feeling confident, what's your go to thing to do?\n\nPretend. Yeah, you have to pretend. And that's why you deserve an Oscar one day.\n\nIf there's someone that you look up to that you feel like always embodies, like, confidence and stuff, think about them.\n\nThat's what I do. Honestly, I'll think about someone that I'm like, I know this person is always eating.\n\nThey're always confident I love, and I just, like, honestly pretend that I'm them if I'm feeling insecure.\n\nOkay, we have to talk before you go. We have to talk about your dress. Yes.\n\nUB sass. Thank you. It's giving old Hollywood.\n\nI love the black and white. Yeah. No, she's a tall drink of water.\n\nShe's so gorgeous. And I love the high pony. Thank you.\n\nHow do you pick your hairstyle for, like, to match the dress? I never wear my hair up.\n\nEver. Neither do I. Are we twins?\n\nWe look the same. I hate my ears. We do look the same.\n\nWe're twins. Wait. Someone told me I had elf ears when I was\n\ngrowing up. Someone was like. You should get your ears pinned back.\n\nAnd it ruined my life. So here we are. That's so crazy.\n\nI love my ears. No, no, she loves. And you can hear me so well right now.\n\nYou know what I mean? No, absolutely I do. I can hear them across the street.\n\nNo, but nothing gets past you. I honestly just, like, I don't know, I just feel like I try to look at an outfit.\n\nI honestly did this fitting with my hair up, and I was like, I kind of like it, and I hate that I like it.\n\nSo hopefully I don't hate all the photos that come out. No, you crushed it.\n\nYou're absolutely. We look up to you. You killed all the time to think about you.\n\nWhen we want to be confident, when we get inside. Yes.\n\nWe love you. Back to him.\n\nI'm thinking. No thank you. Thank you for doing this.\n\nYou okay? I don't get this. I could.\n\nI'm sorry. You caught me gossiping. I know we were.\n\nWe were gossiping. Emma's my girl, I love you. You know I love you so much.\n\nSo much. This is all the conversation is gonna be. I love you so much.\n\nWe're just gonna gush, but I'm gonna be professional and say this. Okay.\n\nYou look incredible. Thank you so much. Now, I do need you to know.\n\nI knew as soon as she walked off, I was like Jean-Paul Gaultier, right? Yeah.\n\nObviously, it's Jean-Paul Gaultier. Bye, Ludovic. Unbelievable.\n\nI, like, saw this collection, and I was like, if I don't wear that, I'm gonna be sad. I'm gonna be heartbroken with the hat.\n\nLike, it's all so tough, baby. Thank you. It's so tough.\n\nIt's the best you've ever looked. Wait. Stop!\n\nIs it? Thank you. I know she always looks good.\n\nAnd I need you to know I said it off camera, too. And if I don't like someone's.\n\nLook, I don't say it. I love that about you. I'll find a way to come up with something\n\nelse. I love that. It's the best you've ever looked.\n\nI love the short on you. And it's not easy to pull off for most people.\n\nThank you for giving me 80s. I love that. Well, I just like to be honest.\n\nThe reason why I did it and the reason why I chopped it all off was because, honestly. Well, I wanted a change.\n\nI was kind of sick of, like, long hair. I've had it my whole life. But also, it's so much easier to have short\n\nhair. I wake up. Sure is.\n\nAnd my hair is just done. I love that we are almost twinning.\n\nI'm going to go. I'm going to go for your blond soon, I'm sure.\n\nLet's do it I would love I would love so much. Good.\n\nOkay. We were talking about this before you guys joined us.\n\nChamberlain. Coffee? Yes.\n\nYou launched a store? Yes. Wait.\n\nWhat are we calling it? A cafe. Cafe?\n\nA cafe? A cafe that went nuts. It's been truly like an incredible\n\nblessing. Is this the first of many? It's the first of many, hopefully.\n\nBut I always am like. Oh, God. Now, did I jinx it or something?\n\nBut I would love to give me an exclusive. Where's the next one? Opening?\n\nI actually don't know. You know, I would give you the exclusive, but.\n\nAll right, all right. But we're, like, almost house hunting. Do you know what I mean?\n\nIt's like. Which is so fun. Yeah, we're shopping for the next place, but\n\nit's like you want the aura of the space to be, right? And that takes time.\n\nI'm telling you, this one's going to rule the world one day. She's the baddest around, all right?\n\nRight. If you don't rule the world first, I can't gush anymore.\n\nYou got to go. She's gonna go to the party. I'm gonna see you in the party.\n\nI love you. I love you. I love this girl.\n\nI love you. That's it, that's it. We're out.\n\nI'm going home. I'll see you all later. No.\n\nI'm joking. Well, come join us. Come join us.\n\nLook at this switcheroo. Don't worry about it. Hello, Alan.\n\nHow are you, sir? Good to see you. Very well.\n\nThanks. You're so dapper. You look so dapper.\n\nSo I met you at a party earlier on this year or last year with Corinna.\n\nUm. And you were wearing a gorgeous white suit. And I asked her was that man styled himself\n\nbecause he looks incredible. And you do stuff that most people don't do. Can you tell me about how you get ready for\n\nan event. Do you work with a status or do you just tell yourself?\n\nNo, I work with the stylist Erica Cloud, but do you push that stylist to push you harder because you don't dress like most men?\n\nI do push her to like. I push her to push me. Do you?\n\nYou care about fashion? I do care about fashion. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nIt's very much a, like a, like a big part of my life. And I have, like, whenever the cameras\n\nweren't rolling. Yeah. You know, and, um, living in Los Angeles and\n\nnow living in New York, you know, the style is the is the same, but it's different. It sure is.\n\nAnd. Yeah. Yeah, I think the I, you know, I've never\n\nworn sweatpants on a plane, I'll say that. You haven't? Gosh, I live in sweatpants on a plane.\n\nAbsolutely not. I think it's crazy when people get dressed up for a plane.\n\nOkay, wait. I think it's crazy that people get dressed up for a plane.\n\nAbsolutely crazy. I think it's so insane. I just wanna be comfortable.\n\nOkay, enough about fashion. Because I really want to talk about White Lotus.\n\nAnd I know I don't have you for long, right? Um, the the new season of White Lotus has gone nuts, like everyone is talking about it.\n\nDo you do you feel pressure going into White Lotus because it's such a massive show? Yeah.\n\nI mean, I think anybody would be lying if they didn't. If they didn't say that.\n\nYeah. You feel pressured. You don't want to disappoint Mike white first\n\nand foremost. And you don't want to disappoint the fans. Yeah.\n\nAnd you don't want to disappoint the people that you're working with. Right.\n\nYeah. But all of those concerns, like coming to your mind, even, like working with Quentin,\n\nyou know, like Tarantino a couple of times. You always have that kind of going into an experience.\n\nYeah. And then, you know, pretty quickly thereafter, you realize, oh, wait a minute,\n\nI'm a storyteller. That's what I do for a living. I'm going to tell this story as best I can.\n\nNot just the best you can. You're killing it. I'm loving.\n\nI'm such a massive fan. I'm loving the new season. Thank you so much.\n\nAnd you're so damn good on it. Thank you, I think. Terrifying.\n\nA complete A-hole. But I know that you're a lovely man in real life now.\n\nI promise. I promise you that. That by the end of it, we'll fall in love\n\nwith you when it's all said and done. This guy, Rick Hatchet, and the journey that he's on will say something very profound.\n\nAnd it will be visceral in ways that you could not expect. We love a tease that doesn't really give too\n\nmuch away. I'll take that for now. Thank you so much.\n\nWe'll see you in the party. Have fun tonight. Thank you mate.\n\nCheers, buddy. Cheers, buddy. And then we're going to swap.\n\nWe're gonna do a switcheroo again. Look at all these pictures. Thank you so much, mate.\n\nHello, my darling. How are you? Okay, everyone.\n\nCheryl, look at this vision. Um. We did it.\n\nI think I did this with you last year, and I was gagged. I was left gagged, and we had a lovely time.\n\nWell, because you're an angel sent down from heaven. Thank you very much.\n\nYou know, you have the best reputation in Hollywood. Thank you.\n\nUm, can you talk to me about what goes into planning for tonight? Because this is stunning.\n\nThank you. This is Valdrin Sahiti, and my stylist does such an excellent job.\n\nAnd, you know, I think about where we started three years ago to where we have arrived now. Classic simplicity.\n\nTimeless. I am so thankful. I'm so thankful.\n\nShe's so talented. And you look back in 20 years and say, yeah, I looked incredible.\n\nIt's timeless. Um, I wanted to ask you this for a long time. Yes.\n\nNow, when you get up on stage and you say something, it's always profound. As if I've gone to the most incredible\n\nchurch. Do you plan it in advance or. You just are so beautifully philosophical.\n\nAlways. You know something? I'm going to have to take the compliment and\n\nsay that that's just a part of my makeup. It's just a part of who I am as a human being.\n\nI truly, truly believe life is short, and if people don't acknowledge how short it is by spending their days, by being as good as they\n\ncan, as kind as they can, they are wasting their time on this earth.\n\nI could not agree more, and I don't want to take up any more of your time. So go enjoy that party because it's a good\n\none tonight. It's a real good one. The gorgeous Cheryl upstate.\n\nI've got nothing else to say. What's up man? We got Brooklyn, Queens, Albany in the\n\nbuilding. We're actually starting some kind of some kind of band or cult.\n\nJesse, congratulations. You've been on a crazy press tour. Yeah.\n\nYeah, yeah. And, like, you've been killing it with Kieran.\n\nOh, thanks. How do you hype yourself up before an interview?\n\nEspecially if you have social anxiety like this one. Yeah.\n\nWe're nervous. If you've heard or seen me in any interviews, I don't hype myself up at all.\n\nI'm very, very low. Low wattage? Yeah.\n\nUnderpromise and overdeliver. That's it. Yeah, exactly.\n\nI'm obsessed with that. Yeah. Have you, like.\n\nDo you like this party? Like, what are you, like, at a party? Like, is this one that you're like, oh, I'm\n\ngoing to dance. Well, I am like, at a party is somebody who's doing a favor for my wife.\n\nYou're a good husband. Oh, it's like. Like your wife took you shopping and you're\n\nsitting and waiting for her. That's like the energy. Pretty much that.\n\nYes, it's pretty much that. And then she often will walk out with a bag. Yes.\n\nYeah, it's pretty much the same thing. I like that a lot. What a date night.\n\nThe Vanity Fair. Yeah. This should net me several things that I\n\ndon't have to go to in the next six months. Has anyone come up to you for a selfie? Who's really famous?\n\nOh, no. I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that.\n\nNot one person. I couldn't compute your question of like, wait, why?\n\nI don't understand. Oh, have they asked me for a weight? You mean because.\n\nOh, because you're awesome. Jessie. Yeah.\n\nNo no no, no, but I'm not. I think they could tell that I'm not the selfie.\n\nYou're not the kind of guy. Yeah, I think so. I think I give off energy of you'll ruin the\n\nselfie. Something fun. And we had our phones.\n\nWe would take a selfie with you. Then I would. Then you would be my answer.\n\nYeah, yeah, that makes that makes sense. And when you're coming together with a look, do you have opinions with your stylist?\n\nAre you like, this is the vibe I want to put out tonight or does your wife pick your outfits?\n\nUm, sorry. We're hearing a lot of questions.\n\nListen. I'm prepared. No, I they put this on me five minutes before\n\nI left. Yeah. And then, you know, I could take it off and\n\nnever have to wear it until somebody gets married or bar mitzvah in my family for the next several years.\n\nYeah. Do you ever complain about your feet like that?\n\nYour shoes hurt? No. I complain about my feet for other reasons.\n\nOh, okay. Yeah, it's kind of more of a bunion issue. Maybe we'll get into that a little later.\n\nThanks. We'll discuss our bunions more in depth. Vanity Fair is telling us we can't discuss\n\nbunions. That's actually the one thing we weren't allowed to talk about tonight.\n\nAre you working on any new projects? How do you find inspiration for a new project?\n\nLook at me. Just asking the deepest question I could think of.\n\nYou know, we're on this purpose on this planet, Jesse. Listen, we all float around for it feels like\n\na second. Um, look, we're just feathers tonight. Makes it feel like gone with the wind.\n\nYes, yes, it's been amazing. Yeah, it's been amazing. And I think people are ready for this\n\ninterview. I think people are going to. I think just with everything that's going on\n\nin the world, I think people are going to be ready for this interview. I know that it's going to change the climate\n\nin some capacity. Yeah. If anything, Hannah's wearing extensions.\n\nI wear extensions really important. Yeah. Do you know what extensions are?\n\nOf course I know what extensions are. Where? Where I can't even get in a fight.\n\nJesse. I was just asking if you knew. I do, and they are seamless.\n\nThank you. Thank you so much. Would you ever bleach your hair blond.\n\nUh, yeah. Yeah, I definitely do that. Yeah, yeah.\n\nYeah, definitely. Just like on a movie part, I wouldn't like you wouldn't do it like on a Saturday.\n\nWell, even if you're going through a hard time, you might do it on a Saturday because, you know, usually shooting on Monday.\n\nRight? Okay. So you want to do all the hair dyeing on the\n\nweekend. You're smart with logistics okay. Honestly, he's handled everything we've\n\nthrown at him. And we are so impressed by you. Oh.\n\nThanks, Jesse. You're killing it. Go have fun at the party.\n\nYou've survived. Get away from us! You're so funny.\n\nYou survived. We love you. This was a nice back to you, tan.\n\nThat was great. You guys are great. Oh my God.\n\nJesse, um. Oh, my God, is that Cynthia? Please tell me that.\n\nCynthia. I see the nails. It's got to be Cynthia.\n\nOh, Lina. Love this couple so much. Wow, I love that.\n\nUm, Cynthia's giving us a third look of the night. Well done.\n\nCynthia. Sofia Carson, who said she watched my Netflix specials?\n\nSo obsessed. I love her. We ride at dawn.\n\nLook at this moment. A vision, a vision. You guys.\n\nYou guys look beautiful. How did you decide? Hair up or hair down?\n\nYeah, the hair up was easy because there was a lot. See?\n\nWe're all friends. Sorry. That's Hannah's best friend.\n\nHailey Bieber. We just said hi. Hayley, I'm right here.\n\nThat was crazy. Really cool. No!\n\nStop! It's because she's wearing extensions. I know, she's been acting different.\n\nI Halle Bailey it's the hair. It's the long hair. That's why I asked you.\n\nHair up. There was a lot happening here, so it was an easy decision to take it out.\n\nHave you ever done anything crazy to prep for an event like this? No, I'm pretty boring.\n\nI actually had my first shot of tequila before a carpet. Ever.\n\nJust now. Oh my God. Just now.\n\nHow do you feel? I feel great. Okay, good, good.\n\nNo we're not. It's nice. It's like takes the edge off.\n\nWe're sober. If anyone's wondering, this is us sober. Oh my gosh.\n\nSo when you go to these events, do you have any advice for talking to super famous people?\n\nBecause we've not been doing a great job thus far. What have you guys been doing in your\n\napproach? I just we've just been asking silly questions.\n\nThat's nice though. Yeah. Who are you at a party?\n\nAre you a wallflower? Are you not? I like that.\n\nWe're asking her questions that we asked. We're asking her if our questions were good to other people.\n\nNo. You feel like a girl's girl. And so I feel comfortable.\n\nWe do feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. We do feel comfortable with your energy.\n\nUm, but, yeah, when you go into a party, do you have any advice for, like, looking cool? No, because I'm not cool.\n\nI've never been cool. I was a nerd in school, and I still am, so I just, like, approach them like a fan.\n\nBut I try to be, like, subtle about it. And I still say, like, I just admire you so much and I never know if it's the party to do\n\nit, but everyone seems to take it well. Now I have to ask, did you practice posing in your dress?\n\nYou did practice. What did you come up with? I show you.\n\nYes, yes. Show us please. Okay, so we're fluffing.\n\nWe're fluffing. Keep it down. Yes!\n\nIt's gorgeous. It's like a goddess. This is.\n\nTake note of this. This is important. Right on the hip bone.\n\nRight on the hip bone. It's giving angles. Yes, yes.\n\nOh, my. I'm blind. I'm blind.\n\nThis is crazy. Oh, sorry. Took your mic.\n\nYeah. What's your, like, day to day outfit when you're at home?\n\nThe closest thing to pajamas. Yes. Pajamas.\n\nThe closest thing like to comfy sweats. Oversize everything all the time. Girlhood is about balance.\n\nIt really is. Am I right? When you're right.\n\nWhen you're choosing an outfit. Do you ever choose for comfort? Or do you always go for style?\n\nI've ever chosen for comfort. So to be honest, I will say though, today I was between this dress and another dress that\n\nwas a little out of my comfort zone and this one felt the most me.\n\nYeah. So if that's comfort, then maybe this was the dress, but it's not.\n\nParticularly if you look good, you play good. Exactly. No, it's so true.\n\nIt's about how you feel. Yeah. Yeah, it really is.\n\nSofia, thank you so much for coming. We too nice to us. Such a pleasure.\n\nAnd. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nGet out of here. Get out of here! Go hang out with someone.\n\nCool. Oh my God! Yes, yes.\n\nUm, okay. I don't even know what to say right now, but my best friend is here.\n\nWe're freaking out. Haley bleeping Bieber is Haley.\n\nHow are you? Hi. Nice to meet you.\n\nIt's so nice to meet you. My best friend talks about you all the time. She said my best friend too.\n\nNo, Haley. It's it's. Where's Kendall?\n\nBecause I feel like she's coming. She's coming because that's my best friend you're trying to have, like.\n\nYeah, like a Charlie's Angels moment. You always say crush it on the red carpet. Like, truly, always the queen.\n\nThank you. When you're, like, in the fitting for your dress, for something like this.\n\nDo you know, in the first 30s or are you, like, someone that has to try it on, put it back on, take a picture.\n\nKind of more that because once I try something on, I start conceptualizing the whole thing.\n\nThe hair, the makeup, the whole. You give her a persona? The whole thing head to toe.\n\nBut tonight, I actually was really torn between two dresses. But I went with this one.\n\nIt's custom YSL gorgeous. I love it, I'm super happy.\n\nAnd your skin looks so good. Exactly. That's what I want to know.\n\nWhat road are we wearing right now? Um, well, all my skin prep is always road. And then I also have some of our blush on our\n\npeptide lip shape, a lip treatment. Call it out. Hale's.\n\nCall it out. My mom stole one of my lip treatments. So, mom, we'll discuss this later.\n\nIt's okay. I'll replace it for you. Thank you.\n\nI do, I'm like. Mom, I know someone. I'm good.\n\nSo, Hailey, you go to these parties a lot. Are you ever trying besides me? Are you trying to make any new friends in\n\nthere, or is it kind of. You stick with the group. I'm.\n\nI like to stick with my friends, but I am a social butterfly. I start to kind of just, like, run around and\n\nfly around and talk to people. She literally has an aura around her where you just want to befriend her.\n\nI can feel it. She can literally, literally the best. That's how I feel about you.\n\nAnd now you. Haley. We're the three best friends.\n\nHello. We want to know any posing advice. Because you every carpet you just like.\n\nYou look like you're seven feet tall. I always still get nervous about the way to pose, because, you know, I obviously wanted\n\nto look. Well, they're screaming at you, and it's very overwhelming.\n\nI need a beta blocker. It's very overwhelming. You feel like you're about to get robbed?\n\nYeah. It's crazy. Also, as a mother.\n\nNow on the red carpet. How has it changed your perspective on all these crazy events?\n\nLike having something to ground you? Well, you're just thinking about such different things now.\n\nI'm like, I'm going to go inside and be checking my, my, my baby monitor nonstop. So I have a different mindset.\n\nI have a furbo, so I know I check on my cat. She's a mother. She's a she's a mother.\n\nI'm a mother. To actually Haley as a trendsetter, any trends for that are coming up that you're\n\ninto in terms of fashion because we're just or any trends that you're like, I'm so over it.\n\nYou know, what's so annoying is I just answered that, like, I thought about this the other day and I'm like, people ask me this\n\nquestion a lot. I have to remember my answer and now I forget.\n\nI forget. I'm so annoying. You could literally punch us in the face and\n\nwe don't care. Like you don't have to say anything right now.\n\nYou are incredible. Keeping you. We're obsessed with you.\n\nI'm so happy to see you. Thank you for talking to us.\n\nI'll see you tomorrow for brunch. Get out of here. Get out of here.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Lil NAS x, are you kidding me?\n\nOh my God. Guys. We're just.\n\nYay! I like how I'm here. Guys, they have my name with a Z on the\n\nteleprompter instead of an S right now. And we. And that person did just get fired.\n\nYou're fired. No, that person got fired. Get out!\n\nGet them. Literally out also. We've just been staring at ourselves in the\n\nmonitor the whole time, so work it. A vision in white. I'm obsessed.\n\nNo, no, I love it, I love it. I love a cropped blazer, honey. Yes!\n\nOh my God. And the shoe. And the shoes.\n\nCan you, like, lift your leg up? Because I feel like the people at home.\n\nThis is very in right now. I heard, I heard we, Mr. X, I have questions for you.\n\nWhen do you decide to go tiktoking or when do you stop? Because I feel like you.\n\nDo I stop? You know, you go, you disappear for like ten years.\n\nYou come back. Stop it. Right.\n\nHow do you decide? I randomly do it. I like to do it when I like.\n\nHave fun. I don't like to do it, like. Feel like it's an obligation.\n\nYeah. No, I don't like obligated TikTok. Like we.\n\nI wait for this content. I drool for your content, I can't wait. Um, okay.\n\nHow involved are you with putting together looks? Because they're always.\n\nSo you. Yeah. I'm, um.\n\nI'm pretty involved. I never get, like, too crazy. I don't like to step on, like, the stylish\n\ntoes. Yeah. You're not like, yelling.\n\nThey had this. They had this in black. And I was like, okay, can we get it white?\n\nI want to feel godly. Yeah. Can we get, like, on the arm, like my stencil\n\nfor my my next album. Yeah. Like dream boy.\n\nLike I'm getting it on. Yeah. Always be promoting.\n\nPeople don't talk about he lived. He leaves a lot of, um. What does Taylor Swift do?\n\nEaster eggs and stuff. Easter. Easter eggs.\n\nYes. Easter eggs. Shout out to Taylor, shout out Taytay, we\n\nlove you! I need to know, like when you go into a party like this, do you just stunt on everyone\n\nbecause you're a better dancer? Like, are you like, hey, watch this. No, I'm like trying to dance with everybody.\n\nI want to make everybody who looks like they're uncomfortable feel like I'm like. I'm like, yay!\n\nSee if I could dance like you. I'd be like, form a circle around me. I'm going to do something here, you know?\n\nWait, are you guys going to make out? Are you guys going to make out? We're going to do it.\n\nNo, no, not this time. We're streaming so we could. It's not on real time.\n\nNo, no. I'm scared. And also look, his nails look good too.\n\nOh, yes. Oh, yeah. They just came.\n\nThey just came like this. I didn't touch them little things. I used to play your songs all the time to\n\nprep for my stand up. You need to get back to doing it, baby. No, no.\n\nLike when when you're first song came out, you guys aren't going to make out okay. Now he's mad.\n\nNow I'm in a fight. I'm mad. It's okay.\n\nJust scream the next one, okay? I was like, what kind of sexual dungeon are you in right now?\n\nAnd I was like, Lil NAS X. Like, I'm just playing him having fun. No, we are obsessed with you.\n\nYeah. Has anyone, um, like, cool asked you for a selfie?\n\nI'd like to hear tonight. No, because I just got here and I wasn't at the Oscars.\n\nSadly. That's okay. Neither were we.\n\nThis is where the party is. That's cool. Yeah, that was cool.\n\nWhen are you gonna act? When am I going to act? Yeah.\n\nI've had so many opportunities. I keep getting scared. I'm going to do it next time, though.\n\nYeah, do it next time. Getting scared next time. Rooting you on.\n\nYeah. You got it. Euphoria season 18 I'm on you.\n\nImagine if you've been scared in the past. You wouldn't have been where you are today. Okay, I'm not going to.\n\nUm, Mel Robbins, you right now. Let's get back to tan. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you guys so much. Thank you so much. Hi, Lil NAS x.\n\nGosh, that man's handsome. Um. Wow.\n\nGorgeous. Everyone, check out Cynthia. She's always got a look.\n\nShe's one of the best dressed on every red carpet, if not the best.\n\nUm, and this is her third look of the night. She wore two looks at the Oscars, and now she's giving us this drama.\n\nLook at that pose, too. Magical. Magical.\n\nOkay, so we've compared, uh, last year's locks or her past Vanity Fair locks.\n\nIf you see the side of the screen on the right, you'll see what she's worn in the past and she's worn Louis Vuitton in 2024.\n\nIn 2022. Actually, this is the Louis Vuitton look that she wore in 2022.\n\nUm, and the one you just saw was the. Wow. I'm going to repeat that for you.\n\nThis one here is from 2022. And the one with the red backdrop is from 2024 that we saw last year.\n\nAnd she looked gorgeous. Um, and I'm going to throw back to the girls who are with.\n\nLet's see. I can't see I can't see who she's with. Let's see.\n\nShe's with Rachel outside. I will never forget you should. Girls here with Rachel.\n\nWe're literally forgot we were what we were doing as a job. We are here with Rachel Sennott, who's\n\neverywhere right now and is currently going viral for admitting that she's on beta blockers.\n\nAnd, you know, we're on beta blockers. We're strong believers in it. Yeah I didn't.\n\nAre people reacting like it's a big deal? I actually I don't look at the comments. I'm not allowed to.\n\nBut me neither. I think it's a chill, natural thing. Better than heroin.\n\nNatural thing. It truly is. Let me just say it's not something where you\n\nfeel like good, but you just don't feel bad. That's what it is. You don't feel I'm.\n\nI'm literally numb from the neck down. But you know, what I appreciate is we have so much pressure all the time, and people like\n\nto be like, oh, I'm just being me. No, you're like, it gets nerve wracking. And sometimes I pop a pill.\n\nYou can't just raw dog life. That's crazy. No, I'm not being me.\n\nI don't know who this is, but I'm being someone.\n\nI'm obsessed with this dress. You and your stylist, Jared Ellner, are crushing it.\n\nWhat do you tell him before an event to pull off these outfits? Do you have, like, a specific vibe where\n\nyou're like, this is what I want to give tonight? Yeah.\n\nSo, okay. Jared is a genius. Yeah, I would say I want to like Jared, and I\n\nwill mood board. Like, sometimes he'll come over to my house, and then we'll just pull a bunch of photos.\n\nLike, let's just Pinterest a quesadilla. Yeah. But I will say Jared has the vision.\n\nLike he always I'm like, you're amused. He shows me something, and sometimes I'll be like, I don't know.\n\nAnd then I put it on and I'm like, you're a genius. Also, Rachel is hysterical, but also, like,\n\niconically beautiful. You're known for your pout. Can you teach us how to do your iconic pout?\n\nLet's do it in the camera. Like, how do we pull it off? I would say so what?\n\nWhat side of your face do you like better? This. We've been over this.\n\nNo, we've been fighting about it. Okay, so do your favorite side of the face. Okay.\n\nChin down. A little kind of dead eyes. Dead.\n\nAnd then. Sorry, I can't talk because I'm doing it, so.\n\nOh, I feel like I feel like we got the energy of it, though.\n\nBlow out of the lips. I think we got it. I'm obsessed.\n\nAlso, as a comic, you're chatty. You're a yapper. So am I.\n\nTotally. Are you yapping to people in there, or are you playing it cool to everyone?\n\nAre you kidding me? I can't not yeah, yeah. I mean, if you're not yapping, you're not\n\nyapping. Are you alive? You're not living, you know.\n\nRachel Sennott, get out there. We love you. We can't wait to watch your new show coming\n\nout. I'm so excited. Thank you.\n\nThank you, guys for coming. Back to you. Thank you for shopping with us.\n\nAnd we have all been heartbroken by the devastating fires that have ravaged Los Angeles.\n\nFrancesca is with one local organization aiding in the recovery.\n\nI'm here with Nora and Kelly from the incredible organization Baby to Baby. We all know that the Oscars celebrate the\n\nbest performances. What is the best act of kindness that you've witnessed recently?\n\nWell, baby to baby. We've had so many people coming to volunteer to help the cause, coming to donate supplies,\n\nbut also providing, you know, funds and emergency essentials to baby to baby and the families and children we serve.\n\nPeople have been coming in to volunteer just in droves from across the country and here in LA, but also people who even lost their own\n\nhomes have been showing up for us to support the families affected by the Eaton and Palisades Fire.\n\nSo it's been really incredible to see. That's amazing. That's beautiful.\n\nVanity Fair is thrilled to be partnering with Baby to Baby this year, and you've all done so much for children and families here in LA.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about your work so far?\n\nAbsolutely. We're so grateful to Vanity Fair for the resources for coming in and rolling up their\n\nsleeves. And helping baby to Baby provides emergency essentials to children and babies in\n\nparticular. And so already in the last eight weeks, we've distributed 12 million items, including\n\ndiapers, wipes, hygiene products, blankets, strollers, cribs, clothing and those are going to children and families and babies\n\nimpacted by both the Eaton and Palisades fires.\n\nWow. That's amazing. And now that the LA community is turning\n\ntoward rebuilding, What plans does baby to baby have for the future?\n\nWell, we know from our disaster response because we've been doing it for over ten years that families really need help for\n\nmonths and years to come. It's not just these eight weeks, I mean, and immediately, obviously, we were able to\n\ndistribute these emergency supplies to children and families.\n\nBut this will continue and our work will continue for a long time to come. It's a long road ahead for families,\n\nespecially who've lost their homes, their jobs, their livelihoods. So baby to baby will be here.\n\nAnd we can't thank Vanity Fair enough for the incredible support they've given.\n\nThank you Francesca. We are with the one and only Jeremy Pope. This is what my husband wants to do to me\n\nwhen I get too chatty. That's. You look incredible.\n\nWhat is the story of that? What is the story tonight? I'm feeling inspired.\n\nI'm feeling creative. I'm in my Dune era. We're celebrating Dune.\n\nNo, it's. It was a fun look that I love. It's Egan lab.\n\nI pulled it to myself, you are wearing like, are these heels or platforms like a Rick Owens?\n\nCan I, can I lift a little? Okay. Yeah.\n\nNow are they comfy? Are they are a big old chunky platform okay.\n\nAnd if you get tired in the party, you can just literally wrap that around your head. And if you don't want to talk to people, just\n\ncover it up. Wait. I love a man wearing at least some platforms\n\nbecause we're this close to tearing an ACL at all times, and Men Don't Understand has never been the same.\n\nNo, if Prince can do it, then we should all be able to do it. I love Prince, he was a big inspiration in\n\nthis look tonight. Yes. Oh my God.\n\nUm, also, do you get annoyed with people saying your eyes are beautiful?\n\nI appreciate it, that wasn't a compliment. No, you were just saying that was a statement.\n\nJust a statement. I am very grateful. No, JP, we love you.\n\nThank you for coming and getting that party. You're awesome. So much fun.\n\nAh, JP, which does sound like a lacrosse player. JP I did, um, tan back to you.\n\nGood one. Hannah, thank you so much. I am now joined by Conan and his lovely wife,\n\nLiza. Hi, guys. It's a big night for you.\n\nYeah, it was a lot of fun. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, it was really fun.\n\nOkay. Was it fun going in, or is it fun now that it's over?\n\nUh, it was fun when you get to hit the stage. Okay. And then before.\n\nThat is a lot of worrying and work. Okay. A lot of worrying and work.\n\nAnd Liza was very patient. Well, the funny thing is, last couple of months, because I've been a little bit of a\n\nmental case, but once you get on the stage and you're ready, it's fun.\n\nConan, um, I know that this is about you right now, but I need your wife's opinion.\n\nCan you tell me the real, real. What's he like preparing for something like this?\n\nIs he wildly frustrating at home? Not frustrating, not frustrating, not frustrating.\n\nJust very. I have my moments. Does he does he hard working and focused?\n\nAre you his sounding board? Not alone. There are many people who make up the sound.\n\nShe's not the only sounding, but I try a lot of material out on on Liza. But are you honest?\n\nIf you're not feeling something he's going to include. Oh, God.\n\nYeah. No, we had a joke, which I won't repeat, but are you sure you can?\n\nIt's a safe space here. No, no, no, I don't trust you. I don't trust any of you.\n\nUh, but, um, Liza was like, nah, I don't think that's the right way to go. And she was right, and she was right.\n\nAnd it was a joke that the writers really liked. But we got I got rid of it because you\n\nweren't feeling it, and I'm really glad I did. Every writer's favorite way.\n\nNow tell me when you watch him, when he starts to present. Sorry.\n\nWhen he starts to host the Oscars, are you sat there thinking, come on, you can do it. You can do it.\n\nLike, are you a proud, never nervous. Wow. Not at all.\n\nWow. I have faith in him above pretty much anything else.\n\nWill you marry me? Absolutely. I'm a very homosexual man, but very welcoming\n\nin this relationship. It could be a throuple I would love. I've always wanted to be a throuple.\n\nAnd I love my husband. He's great, but he's okay in my life. He's all right.\n\nHe lives for my life. I want to just talk about your hair before we kiss you off.\n\nYeah. Your hair's not as high as it typically is. And I need you to know that I had very high\n\nhair. Also, you know it. It's the weather.\n\nOkay. And my hair is barometric. My hair is barometric.\n\nSo when the hair. When it's humid, when it's just right, it fluffs up, and then it can fall down\n\nsometimes. Conan, you. I don't know if you know, but I had a version\n\nof your hair, so I'm on a Netflix show, and people used to compare me to you constantly. I was the Brown Conan.\n\nYes. And then only a few months ago, I changed it. My question before you leave is, would you\n\never go for something a little different other than the quiff? I think it's too late.\n\nI did it. I went with this a long time ago, and there's nothing we can do.\n\nAll right, all right. Well, on that, we'll let you go. Thank you so much for a lovely evening.\n\nCongratulations for tonight. That's amazing. And thanks for having us.\n\nLovely to meet you. Thank you so much. Thank you everyone.\n\nNow we're going back to Hannah and Bedhead.\n\nThe best of me. I am newly in the Redhead Club. Yes.\n\nWelcome, welcome. Hi. It's nice here.\n\nI do have to say, I watched your documentary on Amazon Prime.\n\nI was so inspired. After that, I wanted I could take over the world.\n\nI'm so sorry. What was your inspiration behind this? Yeah, I just really wanted to give.\n\nLike, she's baring it all at Vanity Fair. Eco friendly. You're crushing.\n\nShe's definitely giving poison ivy. Yes, yes, yes. Green is crushing it.\n\nAnd I love a feather I freakin love. Look at that. The body is body.\n\nNo. It's body. Oh, my God, I'm obsessed.\n\nSo when you go in this party, are you dancing or are you just holding it tight? Posing.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you. I'm standing still. I'm giving statue.\n\nI'm giving Oscar. I feel like they have to pay to, like, see you perform.\n\nI told you that was a different live stream. Yeah, yeah. Don't.\n\nDon't do that for free. That's crazy. I do it for the hotties everywhere, though.\n\nYeah, yeah. No, you do it for the girls. And we appreciate that.\n\nYeah. You give so much confidence to women everywhere.\n\nWhat do you do when you're not feeling confident? I start my day with you and only you.\n\nOh my God. I'm gonna cry. Don't cry.\n\nWe're lying. No I know. No.\n\nYour music has literally, like, made me want. When I want to fight someone. I listen to your music.\n\nYou want to throw that fighting out the window, and you want to get cute and be a bad.\n\nWhen people are talking, I go turn on Megan. Body ody ody. I look beautiful.\n\nI look so great. Wait. No.\n\nYou look so good when you're. But I know because I watched your documentary.\n\nYou've been through so many dark things. How do you get yourself up and inspire people?\n\nI've never seen her this passionate. I just look in the mirror and I'll be like, damn you, that girl.\n\nYeah, right. Yeah, you are that girl. So go outside and act like you're that girl.\n\nNo, we love you. That's how I tackle my day. That I'm crying would be the one that made me\n\ncry. I'll take my pictures. Don't cry.\n\nCry. Do you cry a lot? I do cry.\n\nI'm a crier, I love that. What's your sign? I'm an Aquarius.\n\nOh, I don't cry much when I cry for a reason. Yes, you let it go. Well, keep, keep like letting it all into\n\nyour music. Never, never, never stop. I want to know.\n\nThat was so good. Come on girl. No.\n\nI know we've been staring yourself all the time. Meg, what are you wearing, though?\n\nWhen you're, like, just writing new music. What are you wearing? Big t shirt and panties.\n\nA big t shirt. Like, with stains on it and stuff. No.\n\nNo stains. Oh, sorry. That was me.\n\nLike the perfect big getting ready t shirt. No, just a plain white t shirt. Yeah, or like a graphic T or something.\n\nOne of my favorite celebrities on it or something. Okay.\n\nMy panties. Yeah, yeah, you are, as you should. Your thong.\n\nGranny thong. Always okay. Cheeks always out.\n\nCheeks out. Um, Meg, go in there. You've spent way too much time with us.\n\nWe love you so much. Somebody said they stole my place in line, I gotta go.\n\nOh, oh, oh, I think we should end every stream with cheeks. I'm joined by John Mulaney and Olivia Munn.\n\nWelcome. Thank you for being here. You've been part of iconic SNL moments.\n\nHow did it feel to be back for the 50th anniversary special? Are there any behind the scenes memories that\n\nyou're still laughing about? Um, there was a great pep talk in the cue card department before we started the three\n\nhour show, where they had stacks of cue cards about as high as me and Wally.\n\nThe cue card guy told everyone to just have fun. And everyone laughed because no one was\n\nreally going to have fun until the show was over. The show is over.\n\nYeah. That's great. And John, your Netflix talk show is coming\n\nback in a few weeks. If you could have any guest on the show, living or dead, who would be your dream to\n\ninterview and why? Oh, that's a good question. David Bowie would be my dream guest.\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah, that's a really good one. Yeah, yeah.\n\nAnd between the two of you, who's more likely to end up leading the charge to the dance floor tonight.\n\nIt would be me. 100%. But everyone knows that on site.\n\nI love that. Thank you both so much. Have an amazing night.\n\nHave a great night. Nice to see you. Nice to see you.\n\nOh my goodness. We're live. We are live with the one and only Nate\n\nBargatze, who's changing the world for comedy right now.\n\nThey don't let most comedians in, especially stand ups, because most of us are dirty. Yeah.\n\nHow did you get into this event? You know, I got I got invited this year, I got invited, I feel I still have it.\n\nSo I feel like this is the gateway to the Oscars. Yeah.\n\nSo if you can get here. Yes. Then maybe five years from now, I can get\n\ninto five years, like. Yeah. I figure it's a long plan, but, yeah, I'll be\n\na good game. It's a long game. Yeah.\n\nYeah. So how involved is your wife? Your wife in your fits?\n\nLike, does she give opinions? Yeah, she helps me out. Like she said, put that brooch on and you\n\nsaid okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nI wouldn't have even known that was a brooch if you wouldn't have pointed at it. I would have been like, I don't know what\n\nshe's talking. I go, I go, she's a page, right? Pages.\n\nLose her mind here. Lost her mind. I won't make you spell it, but yeah.\n\nNo, it is a brooch. I saw a lot of people had them. Yeah, there's a lot of guys.\n\nWell, actually, not a lot of people did, because you're wearing it now. All the men are going to start wearing them.\n\nYeah, yeah. Out of the bar. Trendsetters.\n\nThis is where it starts. At the bar. Do you ever.\n\nDo you ever come to these events and you're like, wow. I'm like one of the only comedians.\n\nDo you ever say a joke that just, like, doesn't land with all the respected actors? Yeah, yeah.\n\nI mean, if they don't know the context of, like, me being a comic, you can say something, especially a long story that can.\n\nOh, yeah. That's hard. Like, you will know when you know it's not\n\ngoing to hit even really hear you. You get out of it. They get their security and they're like, can\n\nyou get this guy? I'll wait till someone drags him off, and then I get back to them and go, let me finish\n\nwhat I was. Yeah. Let me get back into it.\n\nSo he golfs with some very famous people all the time.\n\nUm, do you have any advice for dealing with pressure on the golf course and on stage?\n\nBecause you're a calm man. You're a calm man. Like I gotta call you the Ice Man.\n\nIs that. Do they? Yes.\n\nAll right. Oh, God. He lived right.\n\nYeah. I don't know who he is. Uh, the ice man.\n\nWell, isn't that is that, uh, Top Gun?\n\nNate, you've already lost me. I was just trying. Yes, I'm the iceman.\n\nI mean, how do you stay calm before all these intense SNL monologue? Yeah.\n\nIt's, uh, you know, you prepare. Yeah. That's all you do.\n\nIf I get out of the preparation, I'll be in big trouble. And you study hard.\n\nHe goes. Maybe work hard for once. Maybe try a little harder.\n\nYeah. Just give it a shot. Have an idea of what you're going to do.\n\nNate, thank you so much. We love you so much. Thank you so much.\n\nWe can't wait to watch your next special. Thank you very much. Yeah.\n\nPleasure. Great seeing you again. Yes.\n\nPleasure. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\n\nHave fun today. Hello.\n\nOh my gosh. We're joined by Jay Ellis.

She never says that. And I never compliment a man.\n\nIt's against my religion. I really I can't do it. Oh, my velvet, the satin.\n\nOh, it's so good. I appreciate it. Brunello Cuccinelli, are you single?\n\nI'm not. I'm very married. Oh.\n\nMe too. Very happy. What?\n\nWhat do I not look like? I could trap a man.

This looks good.\n\nI love it. So, did you want the red or did your stylist force it on you?\n\nIt looks great. I didn't mean it like that. Yeah, I don't know that.\n\nI thought about the pocket square, to be honest with you. The red is a nice pop, though.\n\nIt does look good. That's how you know. You didn't think about it.\n\nYou didn't even know he was wearing one. Alessio, over at Brunello and Jason Bolden, my stylist, they they they they conspired and\n\ncollabed and then they sent it to you. This whole thing. They said, hey, put this on.\n\nYou said, okay. And I said, okay. Yeah.\n\nHow many different glasses do you own?\n\nWe've all been wanting to know a lot. Yeah, I only take pictures in glasses. Yeah, I'm not sure why.\n\nIt makes you look like you know something we don't know. Yeah.\n\nWhat are you preparing? It's like. It's like the English.\n\nIt's like. It's like my version of a British accent. Yes yes yes yes yes yes.\n\nWho sounds so clever and witty? Everything he says sound unprepared because we don't have accents.\n\nWait. My brother. Oh, that's my brother from another.\n\nHe's running over my guy. Come on. He's literally just jumped over Kylie Jenner.\n\nNo, I'm just kidding. And now the men are hugging, and now the men are hugging.\n\nI thank you so much for coming out. Yeah. Thank you for stopping by.\n\nI'm not really sure why I came over here, but we don't. We're sorry.\n\nThree minutes of. You can yell at your publicist after because that's what she said.\n\nTraumatizing. And we get it. Three minutes that he'll never forget.\n\nThat's what she said. Get out of here. All right, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.\n\nOh, get out of here with your pocket square. Oh my God. Wait.\n\nNow we're joined by the one and only Tinashe. Oh my God. A vision.\n\nA vision. No, do not apologize to us. This corset is insane.\n\nI think it's insane. No, it's the texture. The color, the fit.\n\nIt's gorgeous. I feel like my rib cage is, like, overlapping right now.\n\nI'm obsessed. Wait, you have a sexual energy I can. It's radiating off you.\n\nNot only on the carpet, but in your music. Have you always, like, had just been sexy?\n\nHonestly, I feel like music is a great outlet for me to, like, bring that sex appeal, that ego, that alter ego.\n\nHonestly, I feel like in my day to day life, I'm like very chill, very toned down. Yeah.\n\nAnd so, like with my music, I feel like I can, like, walk, you know. So okay, you say like in your day to day,\n\nyou're toned down. So like, you're not going to the grocery store in this.\n\nUnfortunately not. What's your like normal day style. Like on sweatpants?\n\nYeah. Sweatpants. Hoodie.\n\nYeah. All the things. Like the comfiest clothes, no bra.\n\nYeah. So do you like getting dressed up for stuff like this, or are you, like, my feet hurt?\n\nI mean, it's nice. It's nice to be able to, like, have the range.\n\nYeah, the range to do both. Get a girl who can do both. Who do you like better?\n\nMusicians or actors? I thought you were gonna say me or you. And I was like, please answer.\n\nWe're live.\n\nWe are not going to tell anyone. We won't tell. I honestly, I actors are kind of chill, I\n\nlike them. Yeah. I do have to say.\n\nYeah. Musicians, some of them are a little. They are larger than life at times.\n\nYou have a lot of feelings they can be. I was going to say they can be quite emotional.\n\nOh my God, I dated one. He cried so much, but it was my fault. Yeah.\n\nWhen you go in there, what's your vibe? Are you a wallflower? Are you dancing?\n\nI'm going straight for the champagne. Yes. I'm gonna hit the dance floor.\n\nYes. Where I should be? Yes.\n\nJust bopping and grooving. I love it so much. Are you going to ask for a selfie from\n\nanyone? Or is that like, oh my gosh, I am so not the ask for selfies type.\n\nYeah, neither are we. Like in the bathroom in there. Are you ever just like, oh, and that's\n\nKendall Jenner chill. I'm like, oh my God, I've seen you all. You're all friends.\n\nYou're like, does anyone want a tampon? Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\n\nYou're like, everyone's a human inside. I'm like, oh my God. But you know, keep it chill.\n\nYeah. You always look so good with your fists. Are you very opinionated with your stylist?\n\nLike, I want to wear this. Yes, definitely. You have to be girl.\n\nYou have to be especially. I feel like once you've done a couple of carpets and you come out looking crazy.\n\nYeah, you know that you can't do that anymore. And you have to be kind of decisive.\n\nWell, you crushed it tonight. You truly did. We loved you so much.\n\nLook so beautiful. Thank you so much. So much fun in there.\n\nAnd we love your freckles. Yes. You could not be cuter.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you so much. Have fun and.\n\nYeah. Have fun. Get out of here.\n\nThank you so much for being here. Um, John, we've seen you at a few Vanity Fair parties.\n\nAre there any standout moments that still make you laugh when you think about them? I was here for the slap.\n\nWe were here for the slap. We were here for the mix up. The La La Land mix up.\n\nSo yeah, there's been quite a few standout moments in the bathroom during this lap. Yes, I was in the in the bathroom for both of\n\nthose, but I saw the aftermath. Yes, Ron Howard gave us the play by play. Never go to the bathroom at the end of the\n\nshow. It's going to. It's going to come back to haunt you.\n\nYeah. Oh my gosh, that's wild. Um, and you've both done drama and comedy.\n\nIf you could swap roles with one of your characters for a day, who would it be and why?\n\nOh, jeez. I mean, I don't think I'd want to swap characters, swap places with Don Draper.\n\nThat'd be a real bummer. Um, but I don't know, maybe. Maybe the guy in in Top Gun.\n\nThat'd be pretty fun. Run an aircraft carrier or something?\n\nI have to say, my character from Mad Men, because that would be great.\n\nThat's a good one to be in 1970. In Big sur. So it sounds like a fun time.\n\nYes. Thank you guys so much for being here. Have an amazing night.\n\nYou look. You look amazing. Thank you.\n\nYes. Beautiful color. I am now joined by the hottest couple in\n\ntown. Actually, in the world. We have dove, Cameron and Damiano.\n\nHello, guys. How are you? We're so good.\n\nHow are you? Very well. Thanks.\n\nQuestion. Did we plan the outfits together? Did we want to coordinate?\n\nYes. I knew I was going to be all black. And he.\n\nHe had a secret wish for me also to be all black. Do you typically get to decide first?\n\nI had a fever dream. I came to her and I was like, I want to be like the Beckhams.\n\nWow. So that we're we're working on it. That's a really good inspo.\n\nThat's a wonderful inspo. Now we off camera, we were talking about this and I just want to hit it real hard.\n\nYour style evolution, you were always great, but you were grungier and now you're going for a lot more classic.\n\nWhat was the what was the the impetus for this?\n\nUh, it looks like we are a new band, but we've been actually doing it for quite a lot, and I just need.\n\nI just felt like I needed something different and I needed to be more focused on, like, what I really want to do.\n\nIt's so chic. It's almost like 50s inspired that you're that you're rocking now.\n\nI love it so much, dove. I know we all know what a rock star you are, but is it awkward when you're, like, at a\n\nconcert and everyone's going nuts for this one? No, not at all.\n\nI'm usually the one going the most nuts. I listen, I'm just as obsessed, so I totally get it.\n\nI can listen, I would love to really talk to you, dove, but it's really hard to look at. If you could see close up what I'm seeing,\n\nit's so difficult to look at her. Brown people don't blush easily. But under my skin.\n\nYou are a knockout. Me knockout. It's fine.\n\nI'm a very gay man. He's perfectly safe. I've never dabbled in that.\n\nRight. Do you know Teyana Taylor, by any chance? Yes.\n\nYou're absolutely beautiful. Hi. Come say hi.\n\nJoin us. Hi, love. Hi.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna let you guys. I'm gonna let you guys go. Thank you for joining me.\n\nIt was so good to meet you both. Can I get one mic? Yes.\n\nLovely to see you guys, darling. Hello, darling. How are you?\n\nOkay, I'm going to help you talk. Talk to me about this number.\n\nHold on. What's going on? I see some needle and thread.\n\nOh, no. Okay, listen. In the car.\n\nI'm gonna. I'm gonna do this. Oh, damn.\n\nThe back's even better. Are you willing to show the back?\n\nYou guys, can we see that on camera, please? Damn.\n\nHave you seen that? Okay. Who are we wearing?\n\nLaquan smith. Oh, we love Laquan Smith. Is this custom?\n\nYes, it is runway. Okay. Question.\n\nYou've been to this event many times. Yes. Are you still intimidated by that?\n\nYes I am. See, I'm, like, nervous right now. I'm so shy and people don't know that I don't\n\nbelieve in Red Carpet. I'm trying to practice how I'm going to post up, like, okay, do I stand like this?\n\nDo I? Okay, here's the problem. So I practice my poses in the mirror.\n\nAnd then as soon as I get onto the red carpet and they're shouting, you forget it all. They'll be like, can you stand right here?\n\nI'll be like, okay, I know. And you look back thinking, that was one of my poses, man, it's a dirty game.\n\nWhy do we work on right now? You acted last year or the year before?\n\nLast year. Okay. Are we working on a new movie?\n\nWorking on a new project. Are we focusing on music?\n\nEverything. Yeah, I actually have three movies coming this year.\n\nAnd a show with Ryan Murphy I'm very, very excited about. Where are you finding the time?\n\nOh, baby, I don't even know. You're working every hour that God sends. Yeah.\n\nI'm, like, literally filming multiple things at once. And.\n\nAre you recording my music? Um.\n\nStay tuned. Let's see. That's a yes.\n\nThat's a yes, folks. We know how to read through that. Thank you so much.\n\nOkay, read the carpet. I'm gonna to try and get too many secrets out if I don't let her go.\n\nSo, Tiana, I'm gonna kiss you off for now. You look gorgeous. Thank you.\n\nThe incomparable Tiana.\n\nWe are so excited to be here with Michelle Rodriguez.\n\nWhat up? Okay, I can't drive. I don't have my driver's license.\n\nAn interview question, am I right? Do you have any advice for looking cool when driving?\n\nUh, do it right. Don't like hit people and stuff? Yeah, don't hit people.\n\nKeep your eye on the road. Keep your emotions to yourself.\n\nWell, we just found out she's from Jersey, so. And they learned that in Jersey to keep their\n\nemotions to themselves. I'm super stoked. You know, we got a Jersey boy as a winner for\n\nbest picture today. Yes. No.\n\nThat's so exciting. I love new Jersey I love Sean Baker, he's awesome.\n\nYes. Represent Sean so good. And how do you think the accents were?\n\nBecause I'm from Brooklyn too, and I thought they nailed it. It was pretty intense.\n\nYeah, yeah I he has a he has a tendency to pick like real, real people for the role. And then, you know, they always just come to\n\nthe table with great performances. I think every film that he's ever directed, he's just really he just knows how to capture\n\ntruth. You know what I mean? And you can feel it when you watch any of his\n\nfilms. So yeah, I'm super happy for him. Yes.\n\nShout out to Sean and Michelle. You've taken on so many badass female roles. Is there something you look for in particular\n\nwhen you're, like, reading scripts? Yeah. You know, because.\n\nBecause of the last name. Yeah. And because I'm a woman I've always had to\n\nbattle for the last 25 years. Cartels. Hookers.\n\nUm, maids. Anything that's poverty porn.\n\nSo I stay away from all that stuff. I basically, you know, I don't like to, uh, representation matters.\n\nIt really does. Well, what you're saying, what you're doing with your presence, I think matters.\n\nYou know, if I were, like, if everybody were doing, you know, amazing work and we had lots of representation.\n\nI could probably be an actress and not so much an activist, but for the last, you know, 25 years that's been pretty much my you're\n\nvery purposeful with the roles you take, for sure. I kind of have to be because nobody, you\n\nknow, there's not a lot of people doing it. So you got to kind of like, and you do not want to be just.\n\nYeah, squared into one place. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\nNo. And speaking of not boring. No, we have to talk about your fashion\n\nbecause the cape. I'm obsessed. It's so powerful.\n\nAnd I love that. It's, like, tight and then, like, flaring out a little.\n\nAnd this is the color of the season. You're so on trend. Yeah.\n\nHow did you pick this? Was it between a couple or. You know Hugo is amazing.\n\nAnd he's he's the fantastic genius behind it all.\n\nBecause you know me, I'm such a tomboy. No, you wouldn't know it in this dress. You wouldn't know it.\n\nGorgeous. Is there a story behind this necklace? Because it's cool.\n\nYeah. Um. So, um, Basically, I get this jewelry from\n\nthis Polish designer who 3D prints everything. Wait.\n\nSo cool. Macabre. And so I have all of his jewelry remade in\n\ngold and silver. Wow. A true Jersey girl.\n\nA jersey figuring it out. Michelle, keep rocking it.

Yeah, basically, babies are in bed.\n\nI get it. It really is what it is. Like.\n\nYou put your kids to bed and you're like, now it's our time. What do Mom and dad do on a night off other\n\nthan this? Oh, well, we have too much fun.\n\nNever too much, I'm sure. We love our good date nights. We love a good meal.\n\nThat's like my love language. I love good food, but can you go out or do you have people in?\n\nWe go out. Yeah we do. We do a date night every Friday.\n\nSo we make sure that we spend that quality time, which is good, especially when she's looking like this and wearing this kind of\n\ndress. Listen, I have been a gay man my entire life, but Sierra is one of the very few people on\n\nthis planet I've seen thinking, what is it about this lady that's doing something to my heart?\n\nI don't know. Since I was a kid, you've been. Oh, just phenomenal.\n\nCan you talk about what's going on in your life right now when it comes to work? Oh my gosh, so much.\n\nI'm excited. I just kind of had a fun session with Tyga on his live stream the other night.\n\nYeah. So you guys got to see us do our song in real time and record our song Dance With me in\n\nreal time. But I have a new song called ecstasy coming up, and it is the ultimate just everything.\n\nIt's like the big sister to my song Ride and Promise for my die hard fans, and I'm super excited for it.\n\nSo videos, grinding everything, my skincare OEM, my rum 10 to one loving on my amazing husband that you have been.\n\nAre you also her biggest fan when it comes to her music? Of course she plays.\n\nYou loved her music ever since. One, two step and goodies. Don't get me started.\n\nI think that we just have a great time just to be able to raise kids and do this. And obviously we're also getting the\n\nproduction space too, with new productions. And so we're getting going. We're excited about some things we have going\n\non.

She was like, do you know you look like Joe\n\nBurrow? I go, have you seen my Halloween costume? Oh, man.\n\nYeah. Actually, I would never have thought it until right now.\n\nYou are so right. Yes. But also, I don't look like Joe Burrow.\n\nJoe Burrow looks like me. Yeah. Gantlet has been thrown.\n\nI'm older, I'm older. You guys, did you watch any of the show tonight?\n\nOf course. Okay.

That is wild.\n\nYeah, yeah. Did you expect it? Of course.\n\nYeah, absolutely. Okay. Are you kidding me?\n\nHe was. He was front row aisle, closest to the stairs.\n\nThere was no way he was not going to win. I was like, we're allowed to say this. You are.\n\nYou are? No, no. It's family.\n\nYeah. Was there any other movie that you watched this year that you were like, this could\n\npotentially win it? Oh, goodness.\n\nI'm thinking fallout season two. No, no.

It was so good.\n\nIt was so good. Okay. When it comes to fashion.\n\nYes. You're looking fantastic. You're looking gorgeous.\n\nMy question is, do you help him? Absolutely.\n\nWe do.

We've fully taken over there.\n\nI have a cat at home. You have a cat? Do you have a cat?\n\nI don't have a cat. I just need one. But my husband calls me the cat, so I wear\n\ncat things. You know.

And that's why we're amateurs at these\n\nthings. You can't steal a snack. I need gloves here.\n\nI need gloves. You don't want to try better next year. That's why I came over here.\n\nI'm like, no gloves. And let's be honest, you don't want to touch us.\n\nBut you're not. We're mere mortals. We look like idiots without gloves.\n\nMore gloves. I'm out of here. We miss the glove memo.\n\nYeah. Yeah. All right, keep going.\n\nGet gloves. This was it. I think we've done it.\n\nYeah, we've done it. We did it. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you.

That's why I'm friends with stand up\n\ncomedians, because they make me funnier. I was in bottom. You were incredible.\n\nI was in bottoms. Okay. I feel like people ask you this all the time,\n\nbut modeling or acting, you got to pick one. What are we doing? I couldn't possibly do that.\n\nThe thing is, you. All your actors are in campaigns, so, you know, you don't have to choose one.\n\nWow. She's right. All your favorite actors are on billboards.\n\nYou're right. You don't ever have to pick one thing.

Just by the sheer amount of star wattage.\n\nYeah. It's true. It's true.\n\nConsolidated into one place. Yeah. It's overwhelming.\n\nI remember the first time I was like, I couldn't even make eye contact because it was too much in one room.\n\nIt's true. No, I know that's how I'm feeling. Yeah.\n\nI don't know what to do with myself, but. Well, good luck and thank you. And thank you so much.\n\nPain gowns. I know we're matching. We're matching this evening.\n\nYou look fabulous.

That's your anniversary.\n\nYou're both off book on the same Nicki Minaj songs. And then it was like, okay, because our\n\nfriends were like, I was in the sketch group. He was in the improv group. We were both gay and they were like, be\n\nfriends. We're like, no, we're not going to be friends just cause we're gay.\n\nAnd then we were friends just for two. They're amazing.

So you guys, when you go in there, do you approach people or just vibe alone?\n\nIt depends. We get a little brave. Like he had to convince me to go up to\n\nSebastian Stan number one talent crush. It was amazing. No, I need to go up to Sebastian Stan.\n\nI'm obsessed. Jawline. Look at us talking.\n\nWe forgot we're in. We're actually we're. This is a job we have to do.\n\nWe literally forgot when you guys go in there, we you when you guys go in there, do you separate like, do you break and then come\n\nback? No, no, I'm, I'm glomming on to this one. Come on.\n\nYeah, yeah. Who's more outgoing? It depends on the context.\n\nYou guys are both quite shy.\n\nYeah. You're kind of. You give wallflower.\n\nWait. Have you guys ever hooked up accidentally? No.\n\nNever. No. We keep it.\n\nWe're sisters. Us neither. But like, the night is young.\n\nYou got to talk to this.

Yeah, yeah.\n\nGood luck on your pictures. Good luck. I have to let you guys know.\n\nAmelia Dimoldenberg. And I love how they put how to pronounce my name.\n\nDemi Moore. And let's be honest, everyone, everyone says Amelia Demi Moore.\n\nAnd you know exactly who we're talking about. It's Amelia. Dims.\n\nAmelia dims. We went up to you two days ago and said, do you have any advice for the carpet?\n\nYeah. Can I tell you I was very starstruck meeting you the other night.\n\nI'm just very. Is that why I thought you were shy? I am shy, but I'm just very impressed by you.\n\nI was watching you on the television yesterday when I was trying to prep, and I was trying to relax, and you were just on\n\nBravo, and I was like, oh, my God, there you are. You relaxed.\n\nDid it relax you? Absolutely relaxed. Me.\n\nNothing like really hot, funny people in a house to relax me.\n\nNo. Amelia. How does it feel to be interviewed?\n\nYeah, guys, I feel like I'm like, I just had a tequila shot.\n\nI'm feeling. Where is everyone getting the tequila? Yeah.\n\nNo one's offered us over to us. I feel like. Yeah.\n\nYeah. I mean, but then, anyway, um, it feels great to be interviewed, actually, because it's a\n\nbit of a switch to me doing all the questions.\n\nCan I call it out, though? Amelia obviously crushing it in comedy. A journalistic icon, but fashion wise,\n\nyes, it's next level. I'm screenshotting all her looks. This is gorgeous.\n\nGuys, this has, like, texture to it. Yeah, I feel like they're not getting the vibe.\n\nYeah, it actually feels good. It's almost like an animal. It's giving the British JLo I said it.\n\nWait, what? I said. And now we've said it.\n\nObsessed. And now we've said it. Obsessed.\n\nI just said it. Okay. Obsessed.\n\nNow my head's gonna explode. Wait, how? How are you guys?\n\nSee? She's turning it. Turning it?\n\nNo one. No one's asked that yet. No one's asked us.\n\nAnd we haven't. We don't really like reflecting on our own feelings because then we get into a dark\n\nplace. It's true. But I feel like you're killing it.\n\nWe're trying our best, and we haven't looked at the comments yet. We'll find out soon.\n\nDon't read the comments. Our team is going like this constantly. Keep going.\n\nAmelia. Get in there and we'll ",

        "content": "Although their paths only briefly crossed at an event in college, Benjamin A. Coppel S. set his sights on a happy ending with Andrea Fernández. Twelve years after their first meeting, Benjamin asked her on a date over text, finishing his message with: “And then just maybe, we live happily ever after, sounds good?” Andrea replied, “Sounds like a plan.” While their first date took place in Los Angeles, where they currently reside, Benjamin headed to the Tamayo Museum in Seoul, where Andrea worked at the time, for their second meeting. From then on, their relationship has been filled with spontaneity, art, and far-flung journeys together.\n\nWhen it came time to plan their wedding, Andrea notes the couple wanted their celebration to feel deeply personal—and in a venue imbued with history, character, and meaning. “We envisioned a location that we could drive by years from now and tell our grandchildren, ‘We got married there,’\" the bride says. “When we asked ourselves what space could hold all that sentiment, my father’s childhood home in Chihuahua was the only answer. It’s a house filled with warmth, family traditions, and stories, and we knew it would make the perfect setting for a truly intimate and nostalgic celebration.”\n\nThe vision for the fall wedding day was clear. “We wanted the reception to feel like an elegant yet effortless gathering—as my grandmother would have organized it in the ’50s—that celebrated the home's beauty while adding a refined, contemporary touch,” says Andrea. “Our planners, Jerónimo Gaxiola and his team, perfectly balanced nostalgia with modernity.”\n\nThis balance was also reflected in the look and feel of Andrea’s wedding dress. When daydreaming about what it could look like, Audrey Hepburn immediately came to mind. “I remember stumbling upon a photo of her in the Givenchy gown she wore to The Nun’s Story premiere, and at that moment, my search felt complete,” she shares. Finding this dream dress was turning into an impossible search until she came across bridal stylist Gabrielle Hurwitz. “I sent her an email explaining my struggle, and she kindly responded. I attached the Givenchy reference, and from our first Zoom meeting, she completely understood my vision,” explains Andrea. “Gabrielle presented three designers, but when I saw Emilia Wickstead’s work, I got the chills. It was an instant connection—I didn’t want to see the other options. She immediately arranged a meeting with Juulia from Emilia’s team, and the process began seamlessly.” Andrea would visit London three times for fittings of the sleeveless ivory silk gown with an elegant Watteau train. “My last visit turned into a mini celebration with my friends, toasting to my dream dress,” says the bride. To accessorize the look, she paired the dress with chic Jimmy Choo Mary Janes and Cartier earrings given to her as a gift from Benjamin. For his own wedding look, the groom kept it classic in a Tom Ford tuxedo.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHi, it's Simone Ashley\n\nand I'm gonna be showing you a little bit of my skincare\n\nand a very simple date night look.\n\nSo I'm just gonna clip my hair away.\n\nI like to use my La Mer cleansing gel.\n\nAs you can see, it's nearly finished.\n\nThat's because I love it so much\n\nand I used just a teeny tiny amount.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI never grew up doing much of a skincare routine.\n\nI always took care of my skin,\n\nbut everything I do, I really like to do it simply.\n\nOtherwise I feel like I'm like overloading my face\n\nand my skin with products.\n\nI had my first skin facial, like back in 2021\n\nand then I was, you know, transitioned to the dark side ll\n\nand I realized how great it is to take care of your skin.\n\nI was very naive and I thought\n\nbecause I have dark skin, I didn't need to use sunscreen,\n\nwhich I think a lot of women with dark skin might feel.\n\nDark skin needs some protection\n\njust as much as any other skin.\n\nI love to use an exfoliator on my face.\n\nThis one is Goldfaden.\n\nI dunno why I say McFaden. [laughs]\n\nIt's pretty empty 'cause I clearly use it a lot.\n\nI try not to exfoliate too much,\n\nmaybe like twice a week or something.\n\nAnd then I mainly go in around my nose\n\nand then I'm gonna go on my lips.\n\nOne day she's dry, one day she's oily.\n\nMuch like my personality. [laughs]\n\nI use body lotion on my face before I put my makeup on\n\njust 'cause it doesn't roll.\n\nYou know when you use certain moisturizers\n\nand they react to your makeup and then it starts rolling.\n\nAnd I usually do my makeup when I'm in a rush,\n\nso I haven't got time for that.\n\nSo I love to use La Roche-Posay. [laughs]\n\nThere's no other way of saying it, La Roche-Posay.\n\nBut in Simone's world it's La Roshay Posay. [laughs]\n\nThen I just like to put that all over my face.\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to use like hand lotion\n\nand now I've upgraded to slightly fancier body lotion.\n\nAnd then just to finish off, I'm gonna use a teeny tiny bit\n\nof sunscreen.\n\n[music continues]\n\nMy skin is prepped\n\nand ready to have some makeup on it.\n\nI kind of work backwards with my makeup.\n\nSo I'm actually gonna start with my lip gloss.\n\nI wanna see the vision\n\nas it's developing, if you know what I mean.\n\nSo I start with a little lip gloss.\n\nPlump Ambition [laughs] from L'Oreal.\n\nThat's my nickname. [laughs]\n\nLips are locked and getting loaded\n\n'cause we'll go back to them at the end.\n\nBut I can feel them like sizzling away\n\nand they're having a bit of a party.\n\nI am then gonna go in with my blush.\n\nI actually sometimes just use a little bit\n\nof the lipstick color that I'm gonna eventually use.\n\nI'm gonna go in with this Armani one.\n\nIt's called Lip Power.\n\nLittle bit, they can be friends.\n\nI actually realize I don't need to put as much on\n\nas I might think I do.\n\nYou know when you're in high school\n\nand you start experimenting\n\nand learning how to do your makeup,\n\nI always loved like a clumpy mascara and I still kind of do.\n\nSo my eyebrows are a little bit crazy.\n\nThey're kind of sparse.\n\nCan you see?\n\nThere's like little gaps in them, which is fine.\n\nI like to stain the skin just a little bit.\n\nAnd then I go in with another brow pencil and I fluff it up.\n\nMe and this eyebrow, we're not friends.\n\nThis one just, there we go.\n\nSo then I go in with my Anastasia eyebrow pencil\n\nin granite or dark brown.\n\n[music continues]\n\nEyebrows are now done.\n\nHappy with those.\n\nTea break.\n\nGirls with dark skin, color correcter changed my life.\n\nI had never really understood what it was\n\nuntil a few years ago.\n\nI get a lot of shadow around my mouth\n\nand color corrector just kind of balances out the shadow.\n\nI go in with my brush\n\nand then do a little bit here, a little bit there.\n\nI think when I was younger I was picking out color tones\n\nthat were maybe a lit a bit too light for me.\n\nAnd then I started just buying stuff, whatever worked\n\nfor me at work on set\n\nand I just stuck to that shade for a bit.\n\nAnd then maybe on another job I'd be like,\n\nOh, this one's actually better.\n\nI would just kind of follow what the pros are using.\n\nI've got a little friend over here, so we're just gonna\n\nask him to go away.\n\nMy first experience as an actor was for a kids show\n\nand they asked me if I was okay with my makeup\n\nand I was sat in the chair and they were like,\n\nOh, you happy with everything?\n\nAnd I was like, Me?\n\nLike, you're asking if I am okay with my makeup?\n\nAnd I wasn't used to, I just thought I was,\n\nI had to do what I was told.\n\nAnd they were like, No, it's your face.\n\nThen I really started watching\n\nhow people were doing my makeup\n\nand learn what I liked and what I didn't like.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of a tinted moisturizer.\n\nI like using this Urban Decay one in shade 70.\n\nNeeds some waking up.\n\nCome on, come on. [laughs]\n\nI've put a little bit, literally teeny tiny bit.\n\nThis is actually, I would say this is too much.\n\nI really don't like going out on a date\n\nor going out with my friends and the makeup\n\nlike over a few hours I start noticing it.\n\nI just wanna forget that I've even got makeup on my face.\n\nSo less is more for me.\n\n[music continues]\n\nAnd then this guy's really annoying me.\n\nMy forehead, I don't like,\n\nI don't put too much makeup on there,\n\n'cause that's where I'm prone to getting spots\n\nand unwanted visitors.\n\nI remember Sex Education kind of well,\n\nit feels like years ago.\n\nWe all auditioned for the same role\n\nand then they kind of workshopped characters around us.\n\nAnd that's when I suggested Olivia like had bubble gum\n\nand blue bubbles and stuff.\n\nAnd she wasn't really a mean girl,\n\nshe was just finding her way.\n\nAnd the more I rewatch watch the series, you realize\n\nthat she's just finding her identity still.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of concealer now.\n\nOh holy concealer.\n\nWhat would we do without you?\n\nFeeling tired?\n\nConcealer.\n\nGot a spot?\n\nConcealer.\n\nI use the shade Walnut.\n\nThis is my NARS concealer.\n\nJesse actually used this on me in Bridgerton\n\nand I never looked back.\n\n[music continues]\n\nBridgerton feels very transformative.\n\nI turn up at 5:00 AM in my pajamas\n\nand then hours later I step out looking like a viscountess,\n\nwhich is just amazing.\n\nI think the girls on Bridgerton really, we all go\n\nthrough such a transformation with the wigs and the makeup\n\nand the dresses.\n\nIt's such a dream.\n\nEvery season I fall in love with Kate's looks more and more.\n\nHer makeup looks are just so, they started off very plain.\n\nShe wasn't wearing much makeup.\n\nAnd then the softer she got, the more lashes were fluttering\n\nand the more color were on her cheeks.\n\nAnd a little bit of lip stick, lip color.\n\nI learnt so much from the makeup department on Bridgerton\n\nand I wish I could say it was my real hair, but it's not.\n\nIt's a wig.\n\nI can't say anything about this season.\n\nI would say as the characters progress, their makeup,\n\ntheir hair, their costumes, all progress with them.\n\nI'm gonna attempt a little bit of eye makeup.\n\nI would happily step out like this, with a bit of mascara,\n\nbut I'm gonna make an effort.\n\nI've got this Rare Beauty bronzing stick.\n\nI'm gonna just get my ring finger\n\nand dab it on my eyelids a little bit like that.\n\nAnd just put it on the lid.\n\nWe're gonna bring it down to the lash line there.\n\nMy mom didn't wear too much makeup.\n\nShe always wore like kohl eyeliner, very Indian.\n\nI'm just gonna get this guy\n\nand I'm just gonna go on like my waterline.\n\nToday I'm in a rush,\n\nso I'm just gonna use a crayon eyeliner,\n\nthe same one I used to stain my eyebrows.\n\nI want to just go in a tiny, tiny bit.\n\nI might be a little bit too smoky.\n\nSo we're just gonna go in with my brush.\n\nAnd then it has a little, it has a jacket. [laughs]\n\nI'm really excited for this year.\n\nI've got some very cool things going on.\n\nOne being the first movie I've ever produced.\n\nPicture This, which is my rom-com.\n\nSo I'm very tired. [laughs]\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nI had lots of creative control,\n\nwhich was really important for me\n\nbecause I grew up watching Bridget Jones\n\nand all the classic studio rom-coms back in the nineties.\n\nAnd I always wanted to be that girl.\n\nI never really saw anyone that looked like me.\n\nSo I was like, you know what, if we're gonna do this,\n\nlet's try and do it right.\n\nSo I had creative say on the character quite a lot,\n\non Pia's character and her background, which was super fun.\n\nAnd I was just really grateful that I could have,\n\nyou know, that the team at 42mp trusted me with that.\n\nI'm gonna use my mascara, which is my L'Oreal Paradise.\n\nNot just Paradise.\n\nIt's Paradise Big Deal. [laughs]\n\nAnd then I also have the F1 movie coming out this year.\n\nIt's produced by Louis Hamilton.\n\nI would say that's one of the dream movies\n\nthat I've ever been part of.\n\nThat was an incredible experience.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with this guy.\n\n[music continues]\n\nWhen I have downtime, when I'm not filming or in the studio\n\nor doing press, I'll go to the banya, which is\n\nlike a sauna and do ice baths and sweat it all out.\n\nI have such a tight knit of girlfriends\n\nand friends in my community in London\n\nand I just hang out with them really.\n\nAnd time with my dog.\n\nMy dog!\n\nLook, I've got this little necklace that has her face on it.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with a little bit of lip gloss.\n\nSo let's take the hair down.\n\nLet's give it a bit of a zhuzh.\n\nI think it's very minimal.\n\nI didn't use too much products on my skin,\n\nso I feel like I'm gonna last all night.\n\nThis was so much fun\n\nand I hope it was helpful for anyone who wants\n\nto learn how to do their makeup\n\nor any girls with skin similar to mine.\n\nWe're gonna put on some Whitney Houston\n\nor some George Michael and dance around\n\nwith an espresso martini.\n\nBye Vogue, thank you. [laughs]\n\n[music continues]",

        "title": "79 Thoughts I Had While Watching the New Snow White",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "The discourse surrounding Marc Webb’s musical remake of Snow White absolutely will not end, but what of…the film itself? To be honest, I kind of forgot there was a film amid all the Gal Gadot-v-Rachel Zegler drama, but there most definitely is one, and it’s officially in theaters.\n\nIntrepid journalist that I am, I booked a discounted matinee ticket to see Snow White on opening day and suss out for myself if the actual content of the film could stand up to the extremely online furor surrounding its purported “woke”-ness, and the answer is…kind of? Watch the trailer for yourself below, and then find (literally) every thought I had while watching Snow White.\n\n1. I am very much the only adult in this theater not in the company of a child.\n\n2. I can’t believe the 10 a.m. showing of Snow White at the Grove isn’t a hot spot for childfree urban millennials.\n\n3. Aw, tiny squirrels!\n\n4. Or rats?\n\n5. Hard to say.\n\n6. I’m into Snow White’s mom’s brocade caftan.\n\n7. I like this song about the bounty of the land and the nobility of all who work within it, even if it does feel incompatible with monarchy…\n\n8. Damn, Disney, chill with the dead moms!\n\n9. Oop, there’s Gal Gadot.\n\n10. A lot of exposition about the wicked stepmother being done very rapidly here.\n\n11. Fair enough, I guess we all know the story at this point.\n\n12. A child in my screening is crying in fear of the enchanted mirror, which is also fair enough.\n\n13. Note to Disney dads: Stop going to war and leaving your kids with your mean wives!\n\n14. Rachel Zegler hive, come through!\n\n15. Not to victim-blame, but that’s an awfully bold lip for someone who’s trying to avoid the ire of the famously jealous and petty Evil Queen.\n\n16. This Disney prince isn’t that hot, but I respect his anti-royalist stance.\n\n17. Why doesn’t AMC serve medieval banquets? My popcorn is really not doing the job right now.\n\n18. I like that they’ve made Snow White a socialist. Bread and roses for all!\n\n19. Now why did they give sweet Rachel the Lord Farquaad?\n\n20. Rachel really does have the voice of an angel.\n\n21. Okay, a little wind in the bob is making me like it more.\n\n22. This tartan apron is kind of working, too!\n\n23. Ooh, hot tension between Snow White and the prince who’s now on the run from the law!\n\n24. Maybe he is hot, actually.\n\n25. The kid in my theater is crying about the mirror again :(\n\n26. Time for Snow White to “go into the forest to pick apples,” per the evil queen’s decree.\n\n27. Huntsman, no! Don’t give the queen Snow White’s heart!\n\n28. Speaking of men in this movie who are kind of hot...hello, Huntsman.\n\n29. Fleeing time.\n\n30. Oh, I LIVE for this CGI deer.\n\n31. I miss my dog.\n\n32. AMC should allow dogs.\n\n33. Specifically, my dog.\n\n34. Okay, sorry, back to the movie.\n\n35. Bunnies!\n\n36. This CGI is truly crazy work, but I love it nonetheless.\n\n37. Ooh, I like the Lord Farquaad bob when it’s wet and a little tousled.\n\n38. I want all of these animals to tuck me in. Some girls have all the luck!\n\n39. Okay, these CGI dwarves are an absolute jump-scare.\n\n40. Can’t say that I’m a fan of their rendering!\n\n41. I wish I lived in a little cottage with six of my friends, TBH.\n\n42. Should I get an old-school triangular sleeping cap?\n\n43. These guys really came around to Snow White fast, I have to say.\n\n44. Oh, shit, mirror’s back and he’s crowned Snow White the fairest of them all.\n\n45. This song could be going harder, sorry.\n\n46. Bros, ease up on Dopey, for the love of God!\n\n47. Aw, I like his friendship with Snow White.\n\n48. “Whistle While You Work” is RTO propaganda. You heard it here first!\n\n49. Ooh, rendezvous with the hot rebel in the forest!\n\n50. Wait, he’s not anti-monarchist! He hates the Evil Queen, but he’s loyal to the king! Boooooo.\n\n51. Free yourself, my man!\n\n52. This song about how everything’s horrible is really hitting in this current political moment.\n\n53. I do love a Disney fight scene.\n\n54. The soldiers’ hats are quite chic, must say. The little blue plumes? Adorable!\n\n55. “If we can give up our meager scraps, we will inherit what was meant for all of us.” That’s right! There is power in a union!\n\n56. Making Doc do surgery seems mean, given that, as he notes, he’s more of a…fake doctor.\n\n57. Oh, spoke too soon, he fixed up the hot rebel! Okay, Noah Wyle on The Pitt!\n\n58. I like this drum set housed inside a giant wooden bird.\n\n59. How is the CGI on this movie managing to make fireflies creepy?\n\n60. For those keeping up with the scared-kid saga, I think he and his mom left the theater. Refund them at once, AMC! Justice for my startled king!\n\n61. Oooooh, romance brewing.\n\n62. Girl, never give a man your emotionally significant jewelry!\n\n63. Especially if he’s going to be dumb enough to wear it in front of the Evil Queen.\n\n64. Okay, I hated the Evil Queen’s hag transformation soooooooo much.\n\n65. Poison apple time!\n\n66. If you were going to design a poison apple, why would you make the antidote true love’s kiss?\n\n67. Babe, I appreciate your trusting nature, but if someone you don’t know is weirdly insistent that you eat an apple......do not eat that apple!\n\n68. Oh no, the Evil Queen had Snow White’s dad killed!\n\n69. What in the Substance are these rapid hottie-to-crone transformations?\n\n70. These dwarves are sweeties for keeping a vigil besides Snow White.\n\n71. The boys (a.k.a. the Huntsman and the hot rebel) are soooooo back in town.\n\n72. I know knee-jerk feminist analysis of Disney movies is so aughts, but....please don’t kiss people who aren’t awake.\n\n73. Oh no, the deer is sad!\n\n74. This I cannot bear.\n\n75. Okay, Snow White’s up and looking daisy-fresh!\n\n76. Dopey piping up! We love to see it.\n\n77. See you in hell, Evil Queen!\n\n78. There’s a new royal couple in town, baby!!! And they’re hot!\n\n79. That was fun and cute, but I will not rest until Disney gives us a princess with ADHD and credit card debt.",

While Hailey favors sleek and refined ’90s looks, tailored suiting, and ladylike dressing, her husband Justin tends to go extra casual and even more oversized, leaning into vintage basketball aesthetics, low-slung shorts, and chunky sneakers.\n\nBut spotted out for date night at Sushi Park in West Hollywood, Los Angeles, the couple found a sartorial meeting point. Hailey wore a collared, cropped, and cuffed beige fitted jacket from With from With Jean, low-rise navy pants, and black thong sandals. The Rhode founder accessorized simply, with her favorite black sunglasses and a thin strapped black shoulder bag from Freja.\n\nJustin followed suit, in a large white shirt, black jeans, and white sneakers. Simple, and in rhythm with Hailey’s own understated look, but still in keeping with his own aesthetic codes.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images Photo: Backgrid\n\nAs mentioned, the style M.Os of Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber tend to diverge these days more than converge. Where Hailey will opt for sumptuous faux furs and nipped in waists, Justin is most comfortable in big hoodies and bigger shorts. When they do match up though, it’s pretty major: like Matrix-chic in full leather to walk the streets of New York, or vintage suiting for Hailey’s Rhode pop-up.\n\nHow to finish off this week’s united stylish front?

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHey, Vogue, it's Gabrielle Union\n\nand I'm gonna walk you through my everyday skincare routine\n\nand my fresh day's makeup look.\n\nFirst step, kick out the retainer.\n\n[retainer clicks]\n\nWhen you don't wear it regularly,\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\ndon't tell my orthodontist.\n\nMe and my husband both have retainers.\n\nAnd every night, just like the scene in Bring It On,\n\nwe pop our retainers in and we pop ours out.\n\nThis is the U Beauty, it's the U Beauty,\n\nit's the U Beauty cleanser, which I love.\n\nAnd just in case, y'all thought I came in here\n\nwith some kind of little makeup situation on, I did not.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nUh-oh, see,\n\nhomegirl didn't get all the makeup off last night.\n\nThis is Witch Hazel, which I use as my toner.\n\nI was very lucky,\n\n'cause I never really had crazy problem skin,\n\nnot until my hormones changed.\n\nAnd then, it was like, Is this acne?\n\nHow do you get acne as a fully grown-ass woman?\n\nBut I found a way.\n\nAnd I had to just start experimenting\n\nand so, I think I'm probably like you guys.\n\nYou try a bunch of different things,\n\nyou see what fits, what doesn't fit.\n\nMy next step is my PCA Skin pore refining exfoliator.\n\nWhen I lived in Miami,\n\nI was, ooh, I was like an oil slick like,\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sound]\n\nbut in California where it's dry heat,\n\nI've also gotten a little dry in my older age.\n\nSo, I have to switch up my routine based on where I'm at.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIf you see someone's skin that you like,\n\nwhat are you doing,\n\nlike tell me the products, tell me the routine.\n\nYeah and I hope that it works for you.\n\nAnd if it doesn't, it's like dating.\n\nYou just keep trying.\n\nMy aunt once said, she said it much more crass than this,\n\nBut men or women are like Kleenex.\n\nYou try one, you use it.\n\nOh look, another one's popped up in its place.\n\nJust keep trying.\n\nNext up is 111SKIN.\n\nThis is their retinol oil.\n\nI'm gonna do it like the TikTokers.\n\nThis is probably the cringe stuff\n\nthat my daughter Zaya is talking about.\n\nTrying to do like a little skin influencer thing.\n\nGet ready with me.\n\nSo, some people have very strong opinions\n\nabout retinol in the daytime, mainly because of the sun.\n\nFor me, it's kind of interchangeable,\n\nbecause I'm psycho about protection from the sun.\n\nThe Therabody face thing.\n\nAnd this is how you know it's mine,\n\nbecause that, something spilled in my luggage.\n\nAnd you can use the cold function,\n\nor you can use the heat function.\n\nI'm using cold because mama didn't sleep.\n\nAnd it stays cold.\n\nI used to just use like a little bowl of ice in the morning.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThe thing about ice is it melts.\n\nIt doesn't stay as cold as I would like.\n\nAnd in this case, yes, I am going inside to outside,\n\nbecause I'm trying to push that inflammation,\n\nthat swelling right on out.\n\nSo, I am a device sucker!\n\nI love a device.\n\nSo, sometimes, you gotta go to the Shani Darden.\n\nThis is when I need backup.\n\nMy whole face is vibrating.\n\nI met Shani when I was doing a little show,\n\ncalled

my makeup done,\n\nit was the same products\n\nthat you could get at any drugstore,\n\nbut it was the touch, it was the feeling like a star\n\nthat I really loved, I really did love it.\n\nI learned

times.\n\nBut after that, I got PTSD.\n\nAnd a part of that is I just have extreme anxiety\n\nabout everything,\n\nwhich I have been working on for the last 25-plus years\n\nwith the same therapist

I think every single look—it doesn’t matter if I’m at home cooking with my daughter or if I’m going to lunch or I’m going to the ball—I don't care where I’m going, it’s going to be head-to-toe Black. And that’s going to be my contribution. That’s the statement I’m going to make.\n\nSaint John in a Yaura Fashion set and Tru Face by Grace earrings. Saint John in Philthy Ragz.\n\nWhat does this look like in terms of planning? Did you get a filming schedule and plan all your looks ahead of time?\n\nGirl, I wish it was that organized! It would’ve made styling much easier. I would say that I know what I’m doing a couple of days beforehand. So then, yes, I can be like, What am I going to wear to lunch with so-and-so? But it just meant that I had to just continue to call in outfits. Thankfully, a lot of them were already in my closet.\n\nI got a rack and then pulled out everything in my closet that was by Black designers, and then pulled out all my jewelry by Black designers too. The challenge was that three weeks into filming I was like, Damn, I’ve worn 40 outfits already. Where do I go now? So then I was calling designers that I knew to be like, Girl, what you got? Can you send me something? Or I’d go to their websites and be like, Okay, I need to buy this. It did become a little bit of a challenge as the weeks went on because I didn’t have enough in my own closet and I wanted to continue. But it also pointed out that I don’t know enough Black designers. I need to know more.\n\nSaint John in Ivy Park (above and at right).\n\nI notice you have quite a bit of Ivy Park.\n\nYes. Somebody on Twitter was like, “We know she’s part of the Beyhive! Look at her. This is like the fifth Ivy Park outfit she’s worn.” But they’re so easy because they match already. So you put it on and people think you put in some kind of effort.\n\nYou’ve worn lots of designer, too.\n\nYeah, Dapper Dan made a set custom for me when he was partnering with Gucci, so that’s something I already owned. I came up to Harlem and he helped me pick the fabric, and we picked the appliqués—the whole thing. I carry Chanel, but it’s a bag from Pharell’s collab. And I wear Louis, but it’s got to be Virgil.\n\nSaint John in Nichole Lynel denim and a Chanel x Pharrell Williams bag.

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "There’s a moment in Charlie Porter’s debut novel, Nova Scotia House, when a character relates that she has attended 14 funerals that year. It’s the mid-’90s in London, and the AIDS crisis is pulsating, but in 1996, anti-retroviral medications would be made available that meant it was possible to live a full life with an HIV diagnosis.\n\nUntil then, the lives of queer people—their emotional arcs, relationship dynamics, imaginations—were tempered by the looming death sentence of AIDS. When Porter first came to London in 1992, that spectre felt close.\n\nNova Scotia House finds its rhythm in an era of the AIDS crisis that has been less focused upon, delicately weaving together queer lives lived before, during, and long after it. Nineteen-year-old Johnny lands in London and falls for 45-year-old Jerry, who is HIV-positive. Their love story is traced with a golden thread of queer magic, from the ’70s gay activist movements that Jerry found his voice in to the fire of their love and Jerry’s courage through his illness. “What am I to do with this anger?” Jerry asks, before dying in 1995. Then, we meet Johnny again, now 45 and grappling both with his pain and the challenge of trying to carve out a more hopeful future.\n\nAs a fashion writer, Porter has often thought about the generation of creative minds lost to the crisis—the art, fashion, culture never realized. As the author of the nonfiction books What Artists Wear and Bring No Clothes, he’s also in tune with the importance of primary sources, something the AIDS crisis largely lacks. When Porter and I meet in an east London cafe, I share that my own uncle died of an AIDS-related illness in 1993, while his partner lived to be an old man. I often imagine the possibilities of their lives if only granted those three extra years, with just some old photos, letters, and his theater playbills to remember my uncle by. The fiction of Nova Scotia House asks both its reader and its author: How can we connect again with radical queerness and countercultural ideas of living? How can we live life as fully, optimistically, and queerly as possible?\n\nVogue: Bring No Clothes and What Artists Wear are both so thoroughly researched and emotionally astute. They feel like historical documents, but also radical emotive arcs. How does your nonfiction practice differ from your fiction?",

FKA twigs has kicked off her Eusexua tour with sculptural, horse’s mane-inspired hair, while Lindsay Lohan entered her Veronica Lake era with what she and her glam team have coined as “almond milk hair.” Lena Dunham gave herself some raven tresses with a DIY dye job, and recent Vogue cover star Sabrina Carpenter shared some fun BTS from the Short N Sweet tour when it touched down in Paris, with some Marie Antoinette-ish curls to match. Aaliyah’s Interlude dropped a banger new song with Rhea Raj and went full cartoon character with a glittering star face decal and golden grillz, and Parker Posey brought Hollywood glam and a statement lip to a glitzy New York opening. Fellow White Lotus star Leslie Bibb also mastered a celestial cheek highlight, and wig artist Maahleek crafted a stunning Shego-esque hairdo.

        "content": "Over the past five years or so, trainer trends have become increasingly retro: Adidas Sambas, Puma Speedcats, those Adidas Japans that look like they were literally transported here from the 1960s (which they were). Slim trainers with gummy soles and classic designs, basically.\n\nBut, on a recent trip to L.A., I noticed a new cult sneaker edging its way into the street-style periphery. A retro one, still, but with a different, cleaner, slightly blockier silhouette. I’m talking about the Autry Medalist Low—an all-American trainer that’s become something of a sleeper hit in recent months. Especially, it seems, around the streets of Silver Lake, Echo Park, West Hollywood and even among the A-list Erewhon crowd. It’s probably just a matter of time before it becomes a universal favorite trainer, too.\n\nJeremy Moeller/Getty Images Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images\n\nIf you’re unacquainted with this cult shoe, here’s all you need to know: Texas-based company Autry was first created in the early ’80s and very quickly became known for its classic-looking unisex Tennis sneakers, with the “Medalist” the standout model. They faded away in the late ’00s after founder Jim Autry’s death, before engineering a comeback around 2019, when the brand relaunched. Now, they’re Katie Holmes’s favourite sneaker (check out any pic of Katie Holmes in an off-duty look over the past few months, and you’ll peep the Autry Medalist Low). Other Hollywood heavyweights in its fanbase include Reese Witherspoon and Kevin Costner.\n\nSome sneakerheads have even pointed to the Autry as an emergent Samba alt. “There’s no way you can talk about Adidas Samba alternatives without giving the Autry Medalist Low a shoutout,” wrote sneaker and streetwear writer Adam Cheung for British GQ at the end of last year, adding that “the American footwear label is definitely on the quieter side of things,” and “they give off vintage vibes without trying too hard.”\n\nUltimately, the sneaker is culty enough that not everyone is going to be wearing them, but classic enough to give the wearer some in-the-know points. Plus, most importantly, thanks to the minimal design and ‘80s feel, the Autry Medalist Low just generally looks cool. Especially—and Katie already knows this, as do the residents of L.A.—with a classic pair of blue jeans.",

        "content": "Ever since the news broke that Ryan Murphy would be getting his hands on the John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy story for a new FX anthology series, American Love Story, everyone (or everyone who’s deeply invested in high-budget political-romance-biopics, so maybe just…me?) has been wondering who the prolific TV creator would possibly find to embody the effortless charm and perennial ’90s chic of Bessette-Kennedy herself. Now, it seems we finally have an answer, as Deadline is reporting that The Wilds star Sarah Pidgeon has been cast in what is undoubtedly the role of a lifetime.\n\nCarolyn Bessette-Kennedy in 1999. Photo: Getty Images Sarah Pidgeon last month. Photo:Getty Images\n\nPidgeon definitely appears to have the dramaturgical chops necessary to bring Murphy’s interpretation of Bessette-Kennedy to life; after all, she has a BFA from the prestigious Carnegie Mellon School of Drama, she got rave reviews in 2022 for her performance as a young Kathryn Hahn (talk about dream roles!) in the Hulu series Tiny Beautiful Things, and her Broadway run as Diana in the hit David Adjmi play Stereophonic earned her a Tony nomination last year.\n\nResume details aside, while one hates to hitch an actress’s castability to something as random and mutable as her appearance, Pidgeon also has exactly the pensive, porcelain-skinned, vaguely patrician beauty necessary to make a credible CBK. Also, I’m pleasantly surprised that the powers that be at FX didn’t automatically cast a blonde in the part. (After all, wigs exist! As does hair dye!)\n\nNow, only one question remains: Who will play JFK Jr.? If it’s Evan Peters, everybody drink!",

        "content": "I recently walked past a CVS with my almost-three-year-old and saw a window display blanketed with marshmallow peeps and plastic eggs. “What is that!!” Alice asked, mildly aghast, mostly titillated. “Those are Easter decorations!” Then I had to explain what Easter was. I leaned into the springiness of the holiday rather than the religious background (no nailing to crosses mentioned). I explained to Alice all the things one typically needed for a great Easter celebration: eggs to hide for a hunt, a perfect Easter basket to gather them in, bunny ears, and not least, lots of chocolate.\n\nI’m Episcopalian, but my stepfather was Jewish, and I grew up only celebrating holidays for their cultural significance. My mom has always loved Easter; growing up, our big party of the year in Los Angeles was an egg hunt tucked under the bougainvillea and eucalyptus trees, followed by a heaving lunch buffet. Our beloved caterer, Paul (a sometimes working actor, naturally), would dress up in an adult-size bunny suit and hide all the eggs before dramatically hopping by, so we all squealed upon seeing the Easter Bunny.\n\nNowadays, I join my mother with my kids for an Easter brunch at her apartment. It’s a perfect moment to lean into garden-themed tableware–a radicchio serving bowl or salad-sized pitchfork and shovel to conjure Mr. McGregor’s garden?—as well as the sweetest spring centerpieces from vegetable surprise balls to carrot or egg candles, not to mention heaps of daffodils and tulips. So what’s in your Easter basket?\n\nVogue’s Favorite Easter Decorating Ideas:\n\nTabletop Decor\n\nBaby animals, trompe l’oeil garden references and gingham party crackers make a pastel fantasia of your Easter tabletop. I like whimsy and color on a spring table, not to mention a little critter. The below tick all those boxes.\n\nSweet Treats\n\nI love animals and I love chocolate so chocolate animals are a total delight, especially when they spark spring spirit. From eggs to sheep to ladybugs, chocolate in all forms! Not to mention my favorite panoramic sugar eggs that were always my favorite growing up.\n\nEgg Hunt Essentials\n\nEaster baskets and egg hunts can satisfy all ages and types. Try a monogrammed, Liberty-print bunny backpack for stashing your hand-painted eggs and a rabbit print tea set for post-hunt refreshment.\n\nOutfits for Every Occasion\n\nFew things are cuter than kids dressed up in bunny ears and primed to egg hunt. Outfit them in some floral-print sneaker sandals or La Coqueta’s sweetest Lilac print dress.",

While seeing those first glimpses of sun and feeling a degree of warmth on the skin is salvation for many, some of us are a little sad to be packing away our winter layers and strong outerwear pieces. I’m thinking of Jennifer Lawrence, who has crafted a chic, cold weather wardrobe that comprises Scandi brands for their heavy duty coats, The Row accessories, and classic flannels. Is J-Law ready for springtime dressing?\n\nHow could any of us have doubted Lawrence’s stealth-chic style gliding comfortably into (slightly) warmer temperatures. The Oscar-winning actor was spotted in New York City alongside husband Cooke Maroney, shedding her usual array of coats in favor of a fuzzy, cobalt blue sweater from The Row, which she layered over a simple t-shirt and paired with indigo blue trousers and adidas sneakers. She also wore her trusty, orange-lensed Port Tanger sunglasses, and seems to have picked up a new vintage bag: A Fendi Selleria, a leather doctor’s style bag with white stitching and a top handle. We know Lawrence loves a statement bag moment, though this one is one of her more muted picks.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Getting a foothold in the fashion industry can be daunting for anyone—but in Christian Allaire’s case, eking out a place for himself as an Ojibwe journalist from the Nipissing First Nation reserve in rural Ontario was especially challenging. As a result, during his tenure as Vogue’s senior fashion and style writer, Allaire has played his position forward, platforming other Indigenous creatives in stories on everything from dream catcher hair to the rise of model Quannah Chasinghorse andVancouver’s Indigenous Fashion Week. Now, in a new memoir, From the Rez to the Runway Forging: My Path in Fashion (Collins), Allaire delves into his profoundly meaningful (and sometimes isolating) experience being a change-maker in his field.\n\nThis week, Vogue spoke to Allaire about building a career spotlighting Indigenous fashion, drawing inspiration from Nlaka’pamux author Terese Marie Mailhot, and what he’d tell his younger self if the two were to meet for coffee.\n\nVogue: How are you feeling about the release of your first memoir?\n\nChristian Allaire: It’s bizarre. You spend so long with a memoir, but you don’t really think about people reading it. So when that time comes, it’s nerve-wracking. It’s very earnest and very raw, so I’m trying not to think about people reading it!\n\nHow does the experience compare to releasing your first book, The Power of Style?\n\nMy first book was very much about championing other people, and this one is very personal and very much focused on me. I don’t really tend to do a lot of writing that’s personal. I much prefer telling other people’s stories, so it was a challenge to do this, because it made me face a lot of things that I probably have been trying not to face.\n\nI was so taken by your description of the contrast between the life that you've built in New York and the life that you describe at home with your family in Canada. What’s helped you unite those two sides of yourself?\n\nLife on the rez is pretty drastically [different from] living in New York. It’s very centered in community and nature and our cultural teachings, so living in a concrete jungle is very much the opposite of that. For me, it’s been about finding fellow Native folks in the city and communing and connecting that way, and having a sounding board for whenever I’m missing certain elements of home or culture. Finding my friends and my people has really helped me bridge those two worlds.",

Not this one.\n\nGomez has also been spending considerate time with her stylist Erin Walsh crafting an elevated, elegant look in powder-blue Prada, anticipatory bridal whites, and glittering Armani Prive. Blanco, on the other hand, favors off-beat denim, pastel linen shirts over tank tops, and wacky prints—with a serious collection of cowboy boots.\n\nThe singer-slash-beauty-mogul-slash-actor and the superstar producer, who announced their engagement back in December, appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon last night (March 20). And this time, Gomez expanded her more retro aesthetic, opting for a vintage Mugler ‘Vampire’ dress. The strapless black knee-length dress features a pointed bustier and puffed sleeves with a peplum. The sculpted silhouette goes all the way back to 1981 in the Thierry Mugler archives, and features the classic Mugler eyelash detailing on the bust. Gomez paired it with sheer tights and red-bottomed, Louboutin black pumps. She wore her long bob sleek and curled in, and painted her nails a fiery Louboutin red.\n\nBeside her, Blanco looked his usual laidback self, in a lilac shirt, white tank, embellished blue denim, and black boots, accessorizing with layers of gold.",

        "content": "Below, Spickard outlines the pros’ method for using concealer to disguise dark circles:\n\nSkin Prep: “Start with a hydrating undereye cream and let that dry down and absorb into the skin,” he says. “I love the Goldfaden MD Bright Eyes Radiance Concentrate.”\n\nConcealer 1: After the eyes have been moisturized, it’s time to go in with a color-correcting shade of concealer. “Take a peachier-toned concealer and tap on three to four dots, starting under the inner corner of the eye and working outward,” Spickard instructs. Let the color-correcting shade dry down until it gets a bit tacky—one to two minutes should do the trick—and then blend it out using a tapping motions with a damp beauty sponge. “Evaluate if you’ve counteracted your darkness and add any additional coverage as needed; then let it dry down and get tacky, and again lightly bounce your beauty sponge onto the product to work it into the skin,” Spickard says.\n\nConcealer 2: After color correction comes brightening. Take a lighter concealer that matches your undertone—cool, warm, or neutral—and place one to two dots of the product under the eyes, from the inner corner to the pupil. “We want this to be concentrated toward the center of the face,” Spickard says. As above, let the second concealer dry down, then tap a wet beauty sponge over the product to blend it out.\n\nSet: To set, Spickard recommends using a velour triangle puff with loose setting powder. (His pick is the Givenchy Prisme Libre powder.) After tapping the sponge into the powder, “rub the puff into the palm of your hand to evenly distribute the powder into the puff,” he instructs. Next, press the powder over the top of the concealer to lock it in and dust off any excess with a brush.",

        "content": "While Y2K style has made a widely celebrated comeback (25 years later, so right on vintage schedule), the most popular perfumes of times gone by still have a lot to say. There’s a quarter of a century of beauty history to reflect on, and while you may not be excited about the resurgence of emo-ish side bangs or skinny brows, how about one of the era’s most iconic scents?\n\n“Perfumes in the ’90s were huge in the same way supermodels were huge, and designers were huge, and personalities were huge,” says beauty editor Jean Godfrey-June. But with the strike of midnight on December 31 1999—a beauty revolution was coming. “The 2000s were all about democracy.”\n\nShe cites the then-revolutionary Lucky Magazine, which she helped start, as being leading this wave. “We showed the prices for everything just like in a catalog, told everybody where to buy stuff, and the industry was horrified.” These days, Godfrey-June’s still working toward the same mission—while smelling like the clean fragrance brand Maison Louis Marie’s No. 9. “It reads as sophisticated and together—if I need that—and intriguingly French and sexy, if that’s the vibe,” she says. “The chic bottle is secretly a rollerball, and the scent is actually an oil, so it feels so nice on your skin and lasts a long time. I even use it on my hair in a pinch to give a little gorgeously scented shine.”\n\nVogue writer Genevieve Monsma (who reflected on the return of vanilla scents) cited the intense Christian Dior Hypnotic Poison as her signature scent of the ’90s, but when the 2000s, there was a vibe shift in the fragrance world. “I wore Stella by Stella McCartney, which came out when my son was born in 2003. It had a cool girl vibe. In my mind, it was the fragrance version of a smoky eye, lowrise jeans, and a Balenciaga moto bag.” Sadly, Stella was discontinued in 2011, but of course, Reddit has suggestions on a replacement.\n\nWe all know that scent has the power to transport us to another time or place with a single sniff—like the halls of our high school, the beauty counter at a department store, a first date. Below, Vogue explore each of the first 25 years of this century and the most popular perfumes that were borne from it. The nostalgia—and selection to sniff—is up to you.\n\n2000\n\nThe beginning of the 2000s ushered in a new category of beauty products: body splashes. At the forefront of this movement was Victoria’s Secret’s Love Spell—the lilac juice scented many high school hallways. And the original fruity-floral formula still lives on—notes of peach, apple, and cherry blossom make this an ultra-bold scent even today—with model Devyn Garcia as the face.\n\n2001\n\nFamed perfumer Olivier Cresp was tasked by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana (aka Dolce & Gabbana) to capture the essence of Capri in a bottle—and Light Blue was born. He started with a note of lemon, inspired by the fruit that grows across the island (and is used in the signature drink, Limoncello), and from there he added green apple, musk, and cedarwood. Throw in a sexy advertisement campaign and it became an instant classic.\n\nDolce & Gabbana Light Blue Eau de Toilette $135 NORDSTROM\n\n2002\n\nThe launch of this iconic scent, which was inspired by Coco Chanel’s famous “I was given a chance and I took it” quote, was revealed in Vogue’s 2002 September issue. Russian-American model Anne Vyalitsyna was the face of the first campaign, where she dangled from a giant circular bottle filled with jasmine and amber patchouli juice. Today, it remains among the most popular perfumes.\n\nChanel Chance Eau de Parfum Spray $138 NORDSTROM\n\n2003\n\nCreated by perfume greats Christine Nagel and Francis Kurkdjian, Narciso Rodriguez For Her was symbolic of everything the ’00s fashion brand stood for: Minimalist and complex femininity. The blend of rose, peach, amber, and patchouli—all housed in a millennial pink bottle years before the color’s inescapable cultural ubiquity—has stood the test of time.\n\nNarciso Rodriguez For Her Eau de Parfum $118 MACY'S\n\n2004\n\nBefore the golden age of celebrity scents (that came later, in the 2010s), there was Curious by Britney Spears. And while this scent was a favorite of my high school bullies—I have flashbacks anytime I smell a note of juicy green pear—its charm is undeniable. Notes of powerful white flowers like magnolia, jasmine, and tuberose, combined with the aforementioned pear, vanilla, and sandalwood are magnetic. It’s something that even Dua Lipa told Vogue in 2019 that she, too, found irresistible.\n\nBritney Spears Curious Eau De Parfum $16 $15 AMAZON\n\n2005\n\nAllegedly worn by both Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift during the start of their careers, Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb is aptly named—it’s meant to emulate a bouquet of 1,000 flowers. The four perfumers behind the original scent focused on floral notes (jasmine, orange blossom, rose, and cattleya) to get the explosion just right.\n\nViktor & Rolf Flowerbomb Eau de Parfum $38 NORDSTROM\n\n2006\n\nA tie for the most iconic fragrance of 2006. In one corner, we have Tom Ford’s Black Orchid. Legend has it that the notoriously specific designer couldn’t find a black orchid with petals dark enough to please him, so he bred one with a California horticulturist—and both the Tom Ford orchid and this perfume were born.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "“What is feminine beauty today?” Miuccia Prada asked backstage at Prada, reflecting on a collection that exposed the clichés of femininity and then confidently exploded them. Doubling down on the subject at Miu Miu, she wondered, “do we need femininity in this difficult moment to lift us up?” As a designer, Prada has always taken an accurate temperature of the times, but her idea—that femininity is a sort of accessory that one can put on, take off, and reconfigure, be it with bullet bras, one-size-too-big slip dresses, or retro brooches—was particularly resonant this fall 2025 season.\n\nFemininity was the common denominator in this season’s jewelry, whether it was wholly embraced or tinged with irony. Take the oversized brooches we saw everywhere from Miu Miu to Tom Ford and Tory Burch. Unlike the jewelry of the past few seasons, which exuded a more bohemian spirit, the finishing touches this time around signaled a dressy put-togetherness. Ladylike details in the form of pavé pendants at Luar and teardrop crystals and pears at Givenchy and Erdem continued to consider the classically feminine by both depicting it as is or reimagining it with a sense of play. See also the supersized pearl necklaces at both Vaquera and Chanel, which bookended the Paris collections. Gold got its moment in the sun this season, too, with designers moving away from the silver tones that have dominated the runways since the minimalism of the Phoebe Philo era found new momentum with the arrival of “quiet luxury.”\n\nThe season’s curveball came by way of satiric Duchampian Readymade jewelry fashioned with screwdrivers (Coach), lightbulbs (Moschino), and even shoelaces (Dries Van Noten).\n\nWould You Like to Super Size Your Meal Today?\n\nExtra-large staples with a sense of play.",

        "title": "I Traded My Coffee For Green Tea—And My Energy Levels Transformed",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "My morning routine is sacred to me: I don’t leave the house without doing my skincare and taking my supplements. Once I get to work, my day can’t start properly without a hot drink at my desk. But where I used to make a beeline for the coffee machine as soon as I reached the office, now the kettle is my new best friend—because I’ve been drinking green tea instead of coffee for a month now.\n\n7 reasons why green tea is a healthy coffee alternative\n\nI wasn’t necessarily a coffee junkie, but I did typically consume two to three cups a day: one in the morning, a second after lunch, and sometimes a third in the afternoon. It didn’t feel excessive, but I had started to notice it made me feel a bit restless and shaky. I’d seen a story about how green tea could be an alternative to coffee, and when I finally got around to doing my own research, I discovered a comprehensive list of benefits that encouraged me to make the switch.\n\nL-theanine for relaxation and concentration\n\nGreen tea contains L-theanine, an amino acid that has a calming effect and can increase concentration at the same time. In combination with caffeine, L-theanine promotes a relaxed but alert mind—ideal for focused work.\n\nMild caffeine content\n\nA cup of green tea generally contains less caffeine than a cup of coffee. Depending on the variety, green tea contains 20 to 50 mg of caffeine, whereas coffee contains 80 to 120 mg per cup. In addition, the caffeine in green tea is released much more slowly than in coffee, as it is bound to L-theanine. It therefore takes a little longer for the stimulating effect to kick in, but it also lasts longer. The result is a gentle, longer-lasting energy boost—without a caffeine crash.\n\nLess acid\n\nAs coffee is more acidic, it can cause stomach irritation or heartburn. Green tea is generally gentler on the stomach and less likely to cause digestive problems.\n\nMore antioxidants\n\nUnlike black tea, green tea is not fermented and therefore contains natural antioxidants, like catechins, which have an anti-inflammatory effect and support cell health while strengthening the immune system. Green tea also surpasses the antioxidant content of coffee, which is usually roasted.\n\nGood for the heart\n\nSome studies show that green tea has a positive effect on the heart. Evidence suggests that regular consumption could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, as the antioxidants present can reduce inflammation.\n\nStimulates the metabolism\n\nGreen tea stimulates your metabolism and can increase energy expenditure. Studies suggest that the combination of caffeine and catechins in green tea may reduce the digestion and absorption of fat in the stomach and intestines.\n\nNot so nerve-jangling\n\nSome people feel shaky or experience a racing heart after coffee. As the caffeine in green tea is released more slowly, these side effects are less common.\n\nWhat happened when I drank green tea instead of coffee for a month\n\nI actually quite like green tea (I know not everyone does), but in the initial days, I missed the more intense taste of coffee. But after about a week, I got used to my new hot drink alternative.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that my energy levels somehow felt more balanced. Although I don’t get the boost my coffee used to give me in the morning, my afternoon slump is also much less pronounced. I have no problems falling asleep in the evening (I usually have my last cup of tea around 4 p.m.). When I had coffee late in the day, I sometimes found it difficult to drift off.\n\nI’ve also noticed that I tolerate green tea better. My morning coffee has given me heartburn a few times, with green tea this doesn’t happen. I am also less shaky and can concentrate better throughout the day.\n\nAfter a month, I can safely say that green tea has permanently replaced coffee in my daily routine. Overall, I feel more relaxed and less jittery. During the week, I simply stick to green tea in a bag, but when I have a little more time I like to have a matcha latte with soy milk. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not giving up coffee forever. It’s just that now it’s an occasional treat, rather than a daily crutch.",

        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nSince 2020, America’s Favorite Pet has been the biggest pet popularity contest in the country. Held annually online, it pits hundreds of thousands of our nation’s cats and dogs against each other in a battle for votes, with winners receiving hefty cash payouts and coveted magazine spreads. It’s intended to be a sweet tournament for pet lovers, and proceeds are donated to charity. But beneath the surface, a controversy is brewing.\n\nYou can see it on one of the Facebook pages for the contest, where hundreds of posts beseech voters to cast a ballot for doe-eyed cats and tongue-lolling dogs. One of these, Shay, is an olive-eyed black feline who also happens to be a double amputee. He seems to have been put on this earth to garner sympathy: He’s a therapy cat, and his owner runs a veteran’s mental health center in Florida. “Two days left to get our favorite bipod up to first!” she wrote in a post. “Shay could definitely use your help.”\n\nHowever, nestled alongside Shay and the countless other hopeful pets—maimed or otherwise—is a subset of people who have made America’s Favorite Pet their mortal enemy. They pen ferocious takedowns, accusing the competition of being an elaborate scam and, furthermore, anyone participating in it of being a hopeless rube. There is no fury like a dog person scorned or, even worse, a cat person scorned. A confrontation was inevitable.\n\n“The rules [of the tournament] are garbage,” wrote one user on the AFP Facebook page, whose shih tzu serves as her profile photo. “How they play emotions with owners and pets.”\n\nAdded another: “I am done with all of this. … This is a scam.”\n\nIt goes on like this: threads upon threads, splintered into unremitting debate, never to be resolved. America’s Favorite Pet seems to drive people crazy—that’s why there are dozens of aggravated Reddit threads and Facebook posts that highlight its social engineering tactics and alleged wrongdoing. In fact, simply Googling “America’s Favorite Pet” leads to a suspicious number of scam-scented first-page results. The top autofill question is about whether the contest is “legitimate,” while subsequent results include multiple posts about the competition on the subreddit r/scams. (In one, someone declares the competition to be an “illegal lottery.”) And yet, it’s undeniable that the tournament does a lot of good for animals; last year’s competition raised over $8 million for PAWS, a nonprofit that rehabilitates and rehomes thousands of neglected pets. (Here’s the giant novelty check to prove it.) So, then, why are pet owners so pissed?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ire starts to make sense once you understand how the competition works. America’s Favorite Pet is a charity drive run by Colossal Impact, a fundraising company designed to generate small donations from individuals, rather than corporations. (Colossal also runs tournaments like Super Mom, Bar Boss, and the Greatest Baker, all of which have the same basic game plan.) As you have likely inferred by now, America’s Favorite Pet sets out to crown a single dog and a single cat with its namesake title. The way to accomplish that is simple—the pet that receives the most votes over several rounds of competition, American Idol–style, takes home the top prize. There’s a lot on the line: The winners receive $10,000, and their pet will christen the cover of either Modern Cat or Modern Dog magazine.\n\nOwners can’t back their own pets, but everyone else can, and contestants get ahead by canvassing their personal relationships—friends, family, co-workers—to cram the ballot box. This isn’t exactly cheap. The first vote cast for a pet is free, but after that, you’re expected to fork over some money. A bundle of 10 votes requires a $10 donation, 25 votes is tied to a $25 fee, and so on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, things get more muddled when you survey Colossal’s competitive structure. In essence, participants in America’s Favorite Pet aren’t facing off against the field as a whole. Instead, they’re pared down into randomly assorted bands of rival cats and dogs, groups they need to conquer before moving into the next tier of the tournament. (There are nine rounds in total.) This is stated clearly on AFP’s website: “Upon entry, competitors will be divided into groups. … Subsequent public voting rounds will progressively reduce the number of competitors.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherein lies the problem. Some of the owners who get involved in America’s Favorite Pet allege that its structure obfuscates—and perhaps embellishes—how well their animals are actually performing. Kelly Zelna, who is from Michigan and owns a tuxedo cat named Richard, is one of them. Shortly after signing up her pet for the tournament, Zelna checked his status on the AFP website. To her surprise, Richard was in first place in his group. Zelna took that messaging to mean that her cat was in pole position to secure the magazine cover, and the $10,000 prize. That would have come in handy—Richard suffers from a feline cardiological condition called HCM, and Zelna says she drops $500 at each of his many vet appointments. “All of my friends and family were really excited about it,” she told me. “We all thought he really stood a chance to win.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, once Zelna made her way to the America’s Favorite Pet Facebook page, she learned that dozens of other owners were reporting similar stories. Their cats and dogs were also in first place, because—again—each of them was in first place in their group. Naturally, Zelna wanted to know how many groups there were. But Colossal doesn’t disclose that information on the AFP website. In fact, the only way you can even find Richard’s page in the tournament is by following a link shared directly by Zelna. When I asked a Colossal spokesperson about this, they told me that although the full breadth of competitors isn’t available on the tournament page during its early stages, they’d happily send out the details to anyone who emailed the company’s support team. I requested that information and learned that the 2025 edition of America’s Favorite Pet launched with 2,352 cat groups and 3,136 dog groups. This meant that Richard was one of more than 2,000 cats who were technically in first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter considering those factors, Zelna began to feel ripped off. “There were so many different people posting, ‘This is where my cat is in this group.’ And I was like, How many groups can there be?” she said. “The contest runs for way too long, so you have to hound your family and friends for months to get votes. I think they keep us in the dark to make everyone feel like they have a shot and keep paying for votes.” (Again, she’s not the only one who feels this way.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI must reiterate that the contest rules—circuitous as they may be—are printed on the AFP website for anyone to see. But it’s also fair to say that Colossal goes to considerable lengths to keep its competitors engaged in the grind. Suzanne Gauthier, a psych nurse from Massachusetts, has a pouty French bulldog named Chewbacca. She entered him in America’s Favorite Pet in hopes of using the money to help with a down payment on a new house after a fire destroyed her apartment. Gauthier actually made it through a few rounds of competition, and along the way, she received messages from the tournament encouraging her to redouble her efforts and score him more votes. She shared some of them with me; all have the grating tone of a spammy banner ad.\n\n“Urgent: It’s now or never! Voting closes at 7pm PST SHARP. Share Chewbacca’s link before it’s too late,” reads one. “Modern Dog cover are so close, Chewbacca can smell it!” says another.\n\n“Chewbacca is this close to 10k,” announces a final message, which features a pinching-hand emoji, suggesting that Gauthier is inches away from a tremendous windfall.\n\nWhat was stranger were the texts announcing to Gauthier that, for short windows of time, donors could purchase votes for Chewbacca on a 2-to-1 ratio—meaning that $10 would be converted into 20 total votes. Gauthier took advantage of that promotion in an underhanded way. She managed to buy her dog a hundred bucks’ worth of votes, breaking the cardinal rule that owners can’t back their own quadrupeds. “I was like, I’m going to hell for this,” she said, laughing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, Chewbacca came up short. As did Richard. Nobody should be surprised. There are a ton of animals in the competition, and a few of the previous winners command sizable digital empires that civilian pets struggle to compete with. For instance: In 2024 a cat named Ysera won the contest. As of this writing, her owner has 778,000 TikTok followers. (Ysera suffered from a neurodegenerative disease and died earlier this year.)\n\nFor what it’s worth, Colossal is unapologetic about all of this. When I reached out for an interview, not only did the company enthusiastically agree to talk to me; they also sent over a glowing feature published by a website called Grit Daily that articulated its mission statement. “People love a challenge. They crave competition, rewards, and the thrill of being part of something bigger,” the article argues. “Gamification taps into that, turning donations into interactive, engaging moments rather than passive transactions.”\n\nIn that sense, despite the many accusations otherwise, Colossal doesn’t appear to be scamming anyone—it has simply translated the tenets of digital hustle culture into a fundraising drive. To succeed, one must cultivate a personal brand, draft in the algorithm, and do their very best to go viral. And, yes, as a for-profit company, it does make money off this: A spokesperson for Colossal clarified that the company retains 36.5 percent of the donations for “competition fees,” as well as up to 13.5 percent for “processing fees,” “prize costs,” and other clerical expenses, all of which are clearly included on the America’s Favorite Pet site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScaachi Koul, a senior writer at Slate who hosts the podcast Scamfluencers and is an expert auditor of swindling techniques, agrees that although that is a pretty penny for Colossal to take home, none of this reads as a hustle. “It seems to be that America’s Favorite Pet can decide what the rules are and what they’re not,” she told me. “This isn’t an election. This isn’t financial law. This is a completely arbitrary set of rules about a cat contest.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what does Colossal CEO Mary Hagen make of all those people calling her a con artist? “We call them non-winners,” she said. “We had 400,000 people sign up for America’s Favorite Pet [in 2025,] and we strategically put out the messaging and the information they need, including the competition schedule, and rules, and rounds very early on. But the reality is that not all 400,000 people open my email. We don’t want people to be confused, but more often than not, when I track down something like that, we find that that individual never accessed their dashboard, never opened an email from us. I’m not sure how to solve that.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis touches on what Koul sees as the bigger issue here: the pet owners themselves, and what they’re really expecting out of this competition. “What [AFP] is doing is trying to get people to buy more stuff from them,” she said. “The point isn’t to decide what cat is cutest. The point is to get you to give them money for an organization so that more cats don’t die.” To her, the inability of pet owners to understand that they are involved in a mercurial popularity contest unbound by any objective measurements is “much more concerning than any nebulousness around where the money is going.”\n\nIn other words, the reason the contest has run into controversy is because a certain division of pet owners are completely out of their mind. They have signed up for a contest that, by its nature, will eventually inform them that they do not, in fact, own America’s Favorite Pet. That information can be psychologically displacing and can quickly lead to conspiratorial thinking. “It’s a scam! Bentley was in first for months until we stopped donating,” wrote one aggrieved owner, clearly reeling from their defeat. “You have no idea how many votes each dog has. … They take in millions.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, that is the point. America’s Favorite Pet does take in millions, and it is just one of the many different tournaments Colossal runs. Last year, it hosted Baby of the Year, a competition that raised a mammoth $24 million for Jessica Alba’s Baby2Baby charity, which distributes basic hygiene items to mothers and children in disadvantaged circumstances.* Currently, Colossal is in the midst of the 2025 edition of America’s Favorite Teacher. The winner will receive $25,000, a trip to Hawaii, and a feature in Reader’s Digest. Hopeful educators are already jockeying in Facebook groups, hoping to crest the tops of their respective groups. Meanwhile, on Reddit, others assert that the whole thing is a racket. These accusations will likely follow Colossal for as long as it’s running tournaments.\n\nMeanwhile, Shay remains in contention to become America’s Favorite Pet for 2025. The winners of the contest will be revealed on Friday. Who knows? Maybe that double-amputee feline is about to be $10,000 richer. Despite everything else, that counts as a happy ending.",

Submit it here!\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI’m not a mom (yet) but many of my friends have young children (ranging from newborn to 8 years old). I love my friends dearly and I love their children! Watching my friends become mothers has been one of the most beautiful experiences of my life. But there’s one big exception…\n\nI have a dirty mouth. I love my expletives. They are always used in moments of inconvenience or hyperbole (think “[beep] the mother [beeping] wind today!”) and never out of genuine anger or, God forbid, toward anyone—and certainly never toward a kid. But in moments where a four-letter (or ten-letter) word reflexively escapes my mouth, my friends (who still themselves curse, mind you!) have started saying, “Mind your language” to me when their kids are around.\n\nI’ve tried playing it off, especially when the kids in question are very young (“They won’t remember,” or “They don’t know what it means”) but I know my friends are right that kids will pick up what they hear as they get older, and that they’re prone to repeating what they’ve heard. So I’ve apologized a few times, but it left, pun intended, a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThe thing is, freedom of language and expression is something I feel strongly about. I don’t want to apologize for it! I’ve known these women since we were teens, and my mouth was just as filthy back then as it is now. They know who I am and that my heart is as pure as my words are nasty. Part of me feels it’s incumbent upon them as parents, when the lesson becomes relevant and if they feel it’s necessary, to explain to their kids that some people (like their wacky aunt) swear a lot, but it’s not something they want them to do for whatever reasons they’ve deemed moral and necessary. I know if I choose to die on this hill, I might end up less involved in these adorable children’s lives than I want to be, but … maybe that’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make, to protect my [beeping] right to [beeping] talk however I [beeping] want to. If you do think I ought to restrain myself, any tips for doing so when the urge strikes?\n\n—Cursing Until the Cows Come Home\n\nDear Cows Come Home,\n\nLook, I’m a fan of a well-placed four- (or better yet 12-) letter word myself. I have also never seen the harm in children hearing such words. It’s easy enough to teach a child that some words are used only in some settings, or that some words are widely considered to be impolite or, if invoked, will get them in trouble or simply upset someone. But it should be fairly simple for an adult to learn that lesson too. If I had friends I loved dearly who didn’t want me to use Kamala Harris’s (and my) favorite curse word in front of their kids, I wouldn’t. Nor would I ever do so in the presence of my sweet mother-in-law, genteel Southern lady that she is. (Hell, I don’t even say damn in front of her. Or hell, for that matter.)\n\nAdjusting one’s language depending on the audience is not an infringement of one’s “free speech.” It’s just polite and practical. (I don’t know what kind of work you do, but since most work environments do not encourage freeform cursing, I’m guessing that there are some occasions on which you keep your filthy mouth in check.) I don’t have any tips for how to do that except to remind yourself that you’re a full-grown adult person who certainly can restrain herself when necessary. The only question is whether your friendships are important enough to you to make this small sacrifice.\n\n—Michelle\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy mom is on a fixed and limited income, so to help her cover expenses my husband and I supplement her income in exchange for childcare. Our kid gets to spend time with his grandmother while we work, and she gets compensated financially. We have a clear schedule that we all agreed on (five hours/weekday). In exchange, we cover a large portion of her expenses. If my husband and I had to pay for alternative childcare, we couldn’t also afford to supplement her income, so we are offering the best solution we can. However, there seems to be some resentment.",

        "title": "Bill Burr special: The key to understanding his comedy and politics.",
        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "If you’re looking for a snapshot of Bill Burr’s worldview, I recommend listening to the comedian’s wide-ranging interview he sat for on NPR’s Fresh Air last week. Burr was promoting his latest stand-up special, Drop Dead Years, which premiered on Hulu Friday, and within 15 minutes on NPR, he had already worked himself up into one of his vintage rages. The target of his ire was Elon Musk or, as he put it, the “select few group of nerds” with “dyed hair plugs and a laminated face” who are authoring the end of the American experiment. Burr, with his roughneck Boston accent, asserts that the ascendant tech oligarchy has successfully obfuscated its takeover thanks to the enfeebled preciousness of the liberal mainstream. What exactly does he mean by that? Somehow, he lands on the overreaches of the #MeToo movement: “You can get canceled as a comedian for doing a Caitlyn Jenner joke, but this asshole can Sieg Heil?” he says, referring to Musk’s eyebrow-raising inauguration Nazi salute. “Where are all of these white chicks at the award shows who were speaking truth to power? Why did they choose to go after comedians and not the Ku Klux Klan?”\n\nHis conjecture doesn’t make much sense; #MeToo was about sexual harassment in the workplace, not the confrontation of domestic terrorist organizations. This about sums up Burr’s politics: anti–conservative fascism, anti–liberal PC culture, somewhat incoherent, and always fueled by anger. The acrimony Burr summons, misplaced as it might be, is his comfort zone as a performer—and it’s why the comedian is currently experiencing something of a renaissance among left-leaning souls who are staring in disbelief at the massive losers who have overtaken the country.\n\nRelated From Slate I Spent a Day Looking Only at What Donald Trump Fans See Online. Sure Does Look Nice From Here. Read More\n\nLongtime fans of Burr will know that the man has stoked an antipathy for “woke culture” for as long as it’s been in his vocabulary. Before that, he dedicated vast swaths of his material to the haranguing of fat people, trans people, and, most commonly, feminists. A decade ago, I listened to him unveil a lengthy (and not very funny) monologue that, most charitably, could be interpreted as an ontological defense of Chris Brown’s assault of Rihanna. Stuff like that used to condemn you to the reactionary circuit, and yet, at a moment when the Democratic mainstream is tilting away from the identity-driven bindings of the Obama era, Burr and his highly cancellable gestalt have never been hotter. Sure, maybe some of the details are a little messy, the edges a bit rough, but few comedians are tapping into the larger mood and big picture like Burr is right now. When a clip of Burr extolling the virtues of accused UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione went viral earlier this year, I was not surprised. “Free Luigi!” he declares to applause. Jimmy Kimmel laughs awkwardly: “Oh, we’re back to Luigi. OK.” Burr’s response: “I never left Luigi!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBurr’s current renaissance is not the result of a pivot on his part; if anything, it’s a sign of how much the popular culture has shifted around him, taking on a more populist sheen, sick of both politically correct niceties and billionaire worship. Burr’s superpower as a comedian has always been his ability to concoct a frothy exasperation that—when aimed in the correct direction—can have an exfoliating effect on the mind. The impact is most cathartic when Burr deploys that ability on the listless bourgeois. In one of my favorite stand-up bits ever, back in 2012, he asked a very simple question of Steve Jobs: What the fuck did that guy do? (“He told other people what to invent?”) After his recent Mangione apologia picked up steam, a 2017 clip from a Burr appearance on Conan resurfaced; riffing on Nestlé’s attempt to privatize American groundwater, Burr, in a Mangionean turn, asserted that the CEO of Nestlé should be “hunted down and shot.” (“This guy wants to own the rain!”) Another clip, from 2014, that likely won’t travel as far in liberal circles as the others have, sees Burr irritated at Michelle Obama. She had just debuted the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls to raise awareness of the kidnapping of 200 young women by the extremist group Boko Haram. Burr was beside himself: “I’m a stand-up comedian. What am I going to do to get those girls back? Why don’t you look across the dinner table? You see that guy? That’s the leader of the free world! Tell him to pick up the phone and call some Navy SEALs and solve it!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s the same flavor of rage, meted out to different characters who all have one important thing in common: access to the levers of power, and thus the mantle for why the world is the way it is. Burr has long contended that he speaks for a sensible majority, and if anything, the Trump years have only provided more political grist for the fury mill. It also helps that the comedian is now the father of two young children, born in 2017 and 2020; that life event supplies the most prominent thread in Drop Dead Years. The comedian has a newfound investment in the Earth and those he occupies it with, a feeling that manifests most acutely in the segments when Burr sheds the hard corners of his persona and cops to the conditions of his ignorance. “Men aren’t allowed to be sad. We’re allowed to be mad or fine, that’s it,” he notes, riffing on the limited scope of emotions he’s allowed himself to experience. Minutes later, he admits he suffers from depression—familiar territory in stand-up, but downright revelatory coming from someone who has structured an act on his own righteous defiance. It’s one of the few moments onstage when Burr exposes himself to esoteric forces of the subconscious or, more flatly, the possibility that he doesn’t know everything and he might not always be right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There are a lot of sad men. I know that now that I know how fucked-up I am,” he says. “Ladies, you’re probably married to a sad guy right now. That’s what the garage is for.”\n\nDeeper in that NPR interview, Burr expanded on the roots of his discontent. He grew up in an abusive household that, he said, saddled him with lifelong anger-management issues. This was all apparently clarified by a recent experience he had with psilocybin mushrooms, which allowed Burr to plumb the depths of his soul. (“I started tripping, and this feeling came over me. It was this profound sense of loneliness. … This [was] how I felt growing up, and it blew my mind.”) The vulnerability, the softness, the willingness to introduce a woo-woo West Coast treatment to his hard-nosed East Coast demeanor: I was almost startled to find that Burr is actually beginning to sound more and more like a liberal in ways that go beyond his concerns for the future of democracy. Unlike other comics forged in his mold—guys like Tony Hinchcliffe, who stick to exactly one note of confrontational, antagonistic MAGA-courting material—Burr demonstrates a willingness to grow, and that has, in turn, made him a better writer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat transformation will continue to clash against some of the thornier elements of his act. Toward the end of Drop Dead Years, he deploys a gnarly anti-gay slur to express the ways in which he’d like to see this country’s neo-Nazis be emasculated. (“I was worried I was getting too preachy,” Burr demurs in the punch line.) That instinct, the desire to provoke, is intractable for most comedians, especially those who have grown exceedingly protective of the words they’re allowed to use, and especially for someone like Burr, who is so allergic to partisan lines. It almost comes off like a challenge to the millennial liberal orthodoxy that might be watching: If you want Bill Burr on your side, you must also be willing to stomach his more prickly tangents—no matter how they might make you feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether you like it or not, a lot of people in America relate to Burr’s disposition. Can you imagine an American voter who holds some, shall we say, problematic views on pronoun policing or the #MeToo movement, while also harboring a very material sympathy for Luigi Mangione? Someone who is anti-woke but believes that the housing crisis has gotten out of hand? Of course you can—they are legion. They crowd Facebook walls and Instagram feeds, they are invited to our living rooms for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and they are also the exact type of citizen that has been legislated out of the Democratic Party. Bill Burr is their avatar, and the question becomes whether the next phase of liberal culture—for better or worse—will be shaped in his image, one primal scream at a time.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Dear Prudence is online weekly to chat live with readers on Mondays at noon ET. Read part 1 of the chat here. Read part 2 below.\n\nQ. Can’t Handle the Family Tension: My husband and I had our daughter a year ago. She is the light of our lives, and our parents adore her. Despite having a close relationship with my dad for 10 years before our daughter was born, my husband is suddenly cold and often rude to my dad. Whenever my dad comes over, he will often go into our bedroom. My dad is so good with our daughter and came and helped me every day for two months postpartum. Since then, he comes about once a week for a few hours; however, it tapered off due to my husband’s conduct. My husband claims that there’s no “room” for him to interact with our daughter when my dad is here, and he says he feels jealous. I’ve tried to be respectful of his perspective, but having to tiptoe around his feelings and watching him hurt my dad’s is really upsetting me.\n\nA: This is odd. I would think that a few hours of babysitting help from a grandparent would be a great time for a dad to say, “I’m so glad you interact with the baby so well! I’m going to take a nap/do some work/go to the grocery store/call a friend/[insert any number of things that are tough to do while caring for a baby].” So I don’t have a strong sense of what’s really going on here. If you don’t have a gut instinct about some specific issue either, I suggest asking your husband a few questions to get to the core of the situation. Try these:\n\n“Is there something specific my dad did that made you uncomfortable or jealous?”\n\n“Does my dad owe you an apology for anything?”\n\n“What would an ideal grandparent visit look like to you?”\n\n“Is there anything you’re worried about when it comes to your relationship with the baby?”\n\n“How are you feeling overall? About our life? About being a parent? Is it possible you’re a little depressed?”\n\n“Is there anything you would really like to change about our life as parents?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m hoping one of those will pull out some additional information that will help him to explain what’s going on so you have something concrete to address. Because without the rest of the story, his reaction to having another capable and loving set of hands around doesn’t make a lot of sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ. Distressed Dad: My wife and I have two kids: an older daughter and a younger son. When they were younger, they used to get along quite well, but now it’s been nothing but fights. I’m 1 of 3 kids, and I know, once puberty hits, the tension between kids can increase, but the conflict between my kids seems a bit extreme. My son refuses to so much as sit beside his sister at a restaurant, attributing this to her outlandish dress being embarrassing. He frequently moves as far away from her in public as possible, not even posing for a photo on vacation when his mom asks. My daughter makes endless jabs at his character, and also prefers to be photographed nowhere near him. My son will scream and yell that he “hates his sister” and wishes that “she never existed.” He also frequently suggests that she is stupid and ugly—even going so far as to make fun of her acne, which my wife and I specifically told him she was sensitive about. My daughter normally shuts down at this point and hides in her room. My wife and I can’t even leave them home alone for a date night because it usually results in one of them (my daughter, for the most part) calling to accuse her brother of physical violence against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have sat both my kids down for a chat about their poor behavior. My daughter has said she believes that her insults are “deserved” and that it’s nothing compared with what her brother does to her. My son is a bit more complicated. His sister is a very open lesbian, and he will sometimes claim that his embarrassment of her is due to her sexual orientation. My wife and I are very openly liberal, so I can’t imagine where he got this idea from, but I’m inclined to believe that her sexuality is just a quick scapegoat for him. Deep in my heart, I hope that they will both grow out of this behavior, but until then, I need advice on how to at least get them to sit down beside each other. We have a trip to Hawaii planned in a few weeks, and I know when they are older they will want pictures of themselves that don’t look miserable. How can I get them to tolerate each other?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I read this a couple of times before it really crystallized for me: You’re trying to “both sides” your son harassing and physically assaulting your queer daughter. Stop doing that. This isn’t a tale of sibling rivalry, it’s not an even fight (I don’t care that your son is younger), and it’s not behavior that they both need to grow out of. It’s behavior that your son needs to stop. Of course your daughter attacks his character. He’s antagonizing her based on her appearance and sexual orientation to such an extent that she has to hide from him. That is a character that deserves an attack!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo address this, you need to change your goal from taking nice photos to having a happy family and letting your daughter live in peace. Your son sounds like a kid who is unhappy and needs help, and I believe that his cruel and homophobic treatment of his sister is a manifestation of a deeper problem. You owe it to your daughter to shut down any comments he makes and to protect her from him, but you also owe it to him to figure out why he’s like this, heal the underlying issue (therapy for him! Family therapy for all!), and also give him the skills to move through the world without turning his pain and distress into bullying. This starts by letting him know you’re a parent who cares more about having children who are healthy, are happy, and treat each other well than about getting the perfect vacation picture.\n\nQ. Step, Not Sister: My dad married my stepmom 20 years ago, when I was 8 and my stepsister, Jane, was 11. My mom had primary custody, so I lived with Jane only on weekends, but we had a fine-enough relationship (different interests, but she was always nice to me) until she went to college 500 miles away and we saw each other mostly on holidays. Recently, she moved back to our hometown, we see each other occasionally, and I’ve noticed something that bothers me: When we meet each other’s acquaintances, she always introduces me as her sister. Not “step,” just “sister.” I don’t feel as if she’s my sister! I feel much closer to my half siblings on my mom’s side, with whom I actually share blood and live five days a week. Jane and I were more like pleasant roommates, and I’m frankly surprised she feels compelled to call me a sibling. At any rate, when Jane tells someone, “This is my sister,” it really bothers me. But I can’t think of a way to correct her, on the spot or privately, that doesn’t get terribly awkward. Do you have any ideas?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I think you should just be OK with being introduced to people you don’t know well as her sister. If it’s someone you’re meeting in passing, who cares? And if you do become close enough and develop an actual relationship, there will be plenty of opportunities to mention something like, “I was a flower girl when my dad married Jane’s mom when I was 8.”\n\nQ. Yes or No: I went through a breakup and am getting back into dating. I’ve been finding it very stressful in general and want to have fun instead. I’m a woman, my previous partner is a man, and the most promising dates I’ve been on have been with a man who seems to have lots of green flags and be kind. I’m just not sure how much we connect but am open to finding out. I want to explore my sexuality, though, and go on some dates with people who aren’t men. I recently got a message from a woman on an app suggesting a one-night stand. This could be a good opportunity to explore my sexuality, but for some reason the idea of pursuing that is really scary to me. I’ve been trying to think of why that is, as long as safety measures are taken), but I’m not sure where the fear is coming from. I don’t want to have regrets, but something is making me hesitate to say yes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I’m torn between telling you to listen to your instincts, which I think can be very important, and questioning whether your “fear” is just internalized biphobia bubbling up. Still, I think you should skip this date, just because being scared is no way to go into a romantic situation. The way you’re feeling could be telling you that this woman is a bad fit, or that you aren’t ready. And even if it means nothing or comes from unconscious misguided beliefs about same-sex relationships being bad, it’s not fair to her to go into getting to know each other with your defenses up. Pass for now, and wait until there’s an opportunity that makes you feel mostly excited and positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ. Template-less: I’m in my mid-20s and found out last week that I am autistic. This is a joyful discovery for me; I feel I finally have the right words to describe my experience. One of the major symptoms I’ve experienced is trouble maintaining relationships. I hate talking on the phone and don’t have the bandwidth to reply to frequent emails or texts. I’ve lost relationships due to this: I’m functionally estranged from several relatives and no longer in contact with my oldest friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am wondering if “coming out” as autistic would help heal the hurt of people who feel I’ve abandoned them, and possibly allow me to have renewed and more sustainable relationships with them. Do you have any suggestions for thinking this through, or for how I might go about doing this?\n\nA: Remember that many friendships and relationships fade out over the years. Don’t assume that any time this happened in your life it was the result of your diagnosis. But if there are people who you know were hurt by your failure to keep in touch and—this part is key—you think you would like to reestablish some kind of connection with now, definitely reach out and explain your new insight. Include a plan for what you’d like things to look like in the future: Can they expect one text and a holiday card a year from you? Will you eventually pick up if they call you repeatedly? Do you do better keeping in touch about a shared interest? Whatever it is, let them know so you don’t set yourself up to feel guilty for falling out of touch again.\n\nRe: Q. Can’t Handle the Family Tension: What was your husband’s relationship like with his own father? When he talks about being “jealous,” it could be that seeing a grandfather lavish love on a child brings up longing for his own childhood—sorrow that he did not get that kind of love from his father (or grandfather). It can be bittersweet. Of course, this needs to be dealt with more constructively, but I do think exploring whether he has some grief is worth it.\n\nA: I didn’t even think of the jealousy possibly flowing in that direction. Great insight.\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris: Thanks, everyone!

But not White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Though she has been busy over the past few days vigorously defending President Donald Trump’s deportations of migrants under dubious legal terms, she has also, in her words, “finally found some time to post a few of my favorite pictures from one of my favorite days”—i.e., her recent wedding to Nicholas Riccio, a real estate developer 32 years her senior.\n\nIn January, the 27-year-old Leavitt joined the second Trump administration as press secretary—the youngest ever to serve in the role, it’s been widely noted—and her tenure thus far has been defined by a steady mix of ridiculous lies and outright hostility to journalists. She’s been front and center, defending every White House whim with the kind of telegenic if sometimes incoherent bombast that the president prefers at the press podium.\n\nThen, on Monday, during the most serious test so far of the Trump administration’s executive authority and the American legal system, Leavitt posted a carousel of images from her wedding to Instagram. According to People, the nuptials took place in January, just “days before President Donald Trump’s second inauguration.” For the event’s location, Leavitt tagged Wentworth by the Sea Country Club, which is in her native New Hampshire. In the photos, she is wearing an updo and a long-sleeved, beaded white gown, and Riccio is in a black tux. He is 59 but actually looks young for his age, or maybe she just looks older than her 27 years—blame the Republican makeup. (I am particularly mesmerized by how her foot is positioned in the second of the photos; the effect is somehow “rom-com poster meets corpse.”)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeavitt is still a relatively new major player in the Trump orbit, so this may be the first you’re hearing of her personal life and much older husband. She filled in some more details about the relationship last week on The Megyn Kelly Show, calling their love story “atypical.” After graduating from Saint Anselm College, in New Hampshire, where she was on the softball team, Leavitt worked as an assistant press secretary in the first Trump administration. In 2022 she ran for Congress in New Hampshire, winning the Republican nomination but ultimately losing the race. This is when she met Riccio, during a campaign event: “I was speaking. We met and we were acquainted as friends. And then we fell in love,” she told Kelly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have more questions about how that happened, but OK! The two got engaged in late 2023 and welcomed a son last summer, also named Nicholas. That same month, Trump was shot, which reportedly inspired Leavitt to skip maternity leave and get back to work. Less is known about Riccio, though People referred to him as a “millionaire,” and he has spoken about living on the streets for periods as a young man.\n\nSo if you didn’t know that the­ 27-year-old White House press secretary was married to a 59-year-old man, well, now you do. It will be another five years until Leavitt is the age her husband was when she was born, ­­­an interesting corollary to the whole “youngest White House press secretary ever” thing. But in this moment, that’s far from the most eyebrow-raising detail here. It’s possible Leavitt genuinely didn’t think it might be distasteful to crow about her wedding right now, but either way, yikes. The post suggests that, for her, this has been just another week of crushing it at work and sleeping great at night. A scary thought.",

It’s anonymous!\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nMy husband and I left some friends in charge of watering our plants while we went on vacation. When we returned, we found incriminating evidence that numerous sex acts had taken place in our living room and our liquor supplies were depleted. Our friends admitted to holding a sex party and apologized for not cleaning up properly and raiding our booze. But then they gave us a truly bizarre proposition.\n\nEveryone who attended enjoyed our house so much that they want to make it their regular place for their activities and are offering to pay $25 per person and promise to bring their own alcohol. This would easily be $300 or more each time depending on how many people showed up. We would just need to be out of the house for a few hours. My husband likes the idea of the extra money and says we should agree. I really don’t feel comfortable with this. Then again, living expenses aren’t getting any cheaper. Should I stand firm here, or is this too good an opportunity for some quick cash to pass up?\n\n—Get a Room … At Our Place?\n\nDear Get a Room … At Our Place?,\n\nIf these people left “incriminating evidence that numerous sex acts had taken place” when they weren’t supposed to be in your house, what makes you think they’ll be more responsible if they have your consent? If anything, I would expect them to be even more disrespectful after they found out they could get away with leaving their sex prints all over your house. Also, the money you stand to make from this setup is not life-changing. Sure, $300 is a nice bonus, but it sounds like you are homeowners and that amount won’t make or break you. (If you are not homeowners, you should absolutely not be inviting strangers into your house to throw parties without your presence.)\n\nIf they plan on doing this often enough that the money will actually make a dent in your expenses—say, once a week—consider the inconvenience of having to be out of your house that often and then having to sop up lube and bodily fluid stains regularly. It would be one thing if you were interested in joining (and invited to do so), so that you could partake while being able to supervise and make some cash. But the parameters of this proposal imply you’d remain an anonymous party, just like you were when they trashed your house in the first place. You don’t feel comfortable with this for a reason. It’s a no from me. Tell your husband to start an OnlyFans or become a streamer or, hell, pick up a paper route or if he wants some extra cash.\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy husband has a lot of fantasies about me that he masturbates to.

The WallStreetBets subreddit that came to prominence during the 2021 GameStop moment is a digital watering hole for people who think they can make a buck whether the markets are going up or down. Things have not been happy at WSB, as any scroll through the most-upvoted posts of the past month would reveal. In viral posts, people are calling themselves slurs for not selling put options (thereby profiting off market downturns) at the right moment. They’re posting screenshots of the thousands of dollars they’ve laid on the line in options trades (something they’re not alone in doing right now). Some are throwing themselves forward as cautionary tales, like the person whose $560,000 portfolio three months ago had become a $270,000 portfolio by last week. (The market as a whole isn’t down nearly that much.)\n\nWallStreetBets is extreme, but in most any financial subreddit, you’ll find fear and regret as Donald Trump throws markets into chaos. “Feeling the heat today,” someone posted in r/investing. “What’s the plan overall?” In r/stocks, yet another investing subreddit, one person wrote, “I told my parents to buy near peak and now I feel terrible.” He elaborated: “I just wanted to write this some where cause I feel like a clown right now. I should have told them to wait with how Trump is imposing tariffs everywhere.” These are among the most popular posts on forums with millions of users apiece. Most of the time in the past few years, the people who have flocked to these spaces have celebrated wins with each other. Now they’re processing losses, at least most of the time. (The roller coaster also goes up some days, as it did when the S&P 500 improved by 2 percent on Friday. Now we await the next elevation change.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn these perilous times, one online community is a port in the storm, full of members who were built for this moment and are now (mostly) flexing their muscles as they ride it out. They call themselves “Bogleheads,” and they stand up as proof that getting financial advice from strangers on the internet is not automatically as grimy as it sounds. That is because the Bogleheads’ entire ethos is that you, a regular person on the internet, should not assume you know much about the stock market. By acknowledging your own lack of special knowledge or skill, you can profit. As the market goes on a roller coaster, every investment banker and financial analyst in the world has an opinion about how you should react. The Bogleheads’ message is much simpler and very likely the best you can do given the information available: Just chill, and trust that if you have money in the stock market, your money will eventually grow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bogleheads are not new. They have been around since 1998, when some Vanguard retail investors started posting with each other on a message board. They are disciples of Vanguard founder John Bogle, a pioneer of index fund investing who believed in (and profited from) the idea that most investors would be best off if they never tried to pick individual stocks and instead placed their investments in low-cost index funds that tracked the whole stock market. Some die-hards have had their own message board since 2007. A few of them wrote a book—Bogle penned the foreword—around the same time. Lately, though, the Bogleheads have seen their ranks swell. The r/bogleheads subreddit had fewer than 20,000 subscribers at the onset of the pandemic. It remains a niche community but is up to 628,000 members now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat’s major growth, but nothing like what WallStreetBets has seen in the same period. The past five years, after all, have been good ones to not be a Boglehead. The Boglehead approach of buying market-matching index funds has done quite well. The Vanguard Total Market Index Fund is a popular Boglehead pick, offering retail investors the chance to own a little piece of all of the world’s big public companies for almost nothing in fees. VTI has grown 104 percent the past five years, which is nice—but it’s not Bitcoin, which has grown nearly 1,300 percent in the same span. When the market is good and highly speculative investments are doing well, it’s not sexy to follow Bogle’s path.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTimes have changed. Being a Boglehead of late hasn’t been fun; nobody enjoys a stock market decline of 10 percent. But it’s been quite a bit more fun to lose that much, purely on paper, than to be a WallStreetBets cautionary tale drowning in a sea of doomed options trades or a Tesla investor losing 30 percent and wondering if your prized stock will go into the tank forever because of Elon Musk. Bogleheads have lost on Tesla too, but Tesla makes up just 1.39 percent of VTI. Most other companies you’ve heard of make up much less than that. When things are bad, it’s nice to be diversified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Why Elon Musk Is Attacking a Website That Used to Adore Him Read More\n\nThe Boglehead subreddit reflects this feeling. There have been many panickers who have wandered into the forum to express their doubts or seek validation for doing the least Boglehead thing of all: selling stocks in a downturn rather than continuing to buy them. But the market correction has mostly served as a weed-out class for Bogleheads who weren’t really up to the Bogle ideology. The subreddit’s top post of the last week is one castigating the heretics: “The amount of people not staying the course, not continuing to invest, looking at their balance every day, and general hysteria is comical.” The Boglehead ideology abhors selling stock in response to a downturn, because it holds that none of us know when the market will go up or down. We only know that the line graph of the total stock market over the decades has gone up and to the right, and so investing in regular intervals and not pulling out in a bad month is the best we can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Sometimes people ask, ‘That’s it? You buy a couple of index funds and then do nothing for 20 years? What’s the point of this subreddit?’ ” one Boglehead told their compatriots last week. “This. This is the point.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have joined the Bogleheads over the past few years. I cut ties with my financial adviser, even though he was a nice guy, because the Bogleheads impressed upon me two key facts: Most financial professionals do not beat the stock market with any reliability, and all of them cost money. I only buy broad-market index funds, which are excellent for both cost and time management. I lack the expertise to pick individual stocks or the appetite to wade into options trading, and knowing that my stock holdings are more or less an exact match for what the entire stock market is doing brings tremendous peace of mind.\n\nThis description somewhat flattens the Boglehead way of doing business. Ask 20 people how much of a Boglehead’s portfolio should be in international stocks or bonds, and you’ll get 20 different answers. But the group’s overarching worldview is the safest bet for both the financial and mental health of anyone who’s interested in having a comfortable retirement: Invest what you can in broad funds that cost very little money. Keep doing it, and only sell when you have a better reason than discomfort with how the market has changed over the past few weeks or months or even years. While American democracy dangles by a thread and the stock market has a horrible time, I draw comfort from knowing my financial fortunes aren’t any better or worse than most other people’s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this is very exciting, which could limit the Bogleheads’ long-term prospects for growth. Seth Rogen will not star in a movie about the Boglehead subreddit, because checking one’s brokerage account a few times a month and setting up automated transfers to buy index funds is just not as cool as formulating an attack on short-selling hedge funds to boost a flailing video game retailer. In times when the stock market is good, being a Boglehead is great, but it’s not cool. In times when the stock market is bad, though, being a Boglehead is better than doing the worst thing of all: panicking.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "This article contains spoilers for the Season 2 finale of Severance, “Cold Harbor.”\n\nThe innies are running the asylum. The finale of Severance’s second season gave most of us what we wanted—a reunion of outie Mark Scout (Adam Scott) with his imprisoned and once-thought-dead wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman)—and then ripped it away with a twist that was both brutal and, perhaps in retrospect, inevitable. After finally managing to talk to each other via camcorder, Mark’s innie and outie work together to bust Gemma out of Lumon Industries’ testing floor and severed floor, two areas where her brain snaps into different consciousnesses with no knowledge of the other. Gemma reaches an exit stairwell where she inhabits her regular, outie brain, but Mark’s innie decides he’d rather not effectively kill himself by going with her.\n\nInstead, innie Mark runs back into the arms of Helly (Britt Lower), the severed version of Lumon scion Helena Eagan. They head back into the recesses of the severed floor, where a bunch of severed marching-band employees are holding cowed severed-floor overseer Mr. Milchick (Tramell Tillman) hostage. Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette), Milchick’s predecessor before she turned on Lumon, began this season by telling Mark’s outie that there would be “no honeymoon ending” for him and the missing Gemma. She ended it by telling Mark’s innie that there’d be none of that with Helly, either. We’ve learned that innies are just as stubborn as their outies about giving up a shot at a future with the only person they love.\n\nApple hasn’t told us yet that we’re getting a third season of Severance, but it feels like only a matter of time, because this show is having a cultural moment that transcends Apple TV+’s otherwise tiny place in the streaming ecosystem. Much of the enthusiasm comes in the form of fan theories, and we learned in the season finale that some of the internet’s most popular hypotheses were bang-on, while others were way off. And while the finale had no shortage of infodumps, we ultimately learned almost nothing about the fates of our characters, save for dead Lumon security boss Drummond (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson), who learned the hard way what happens when an innie’s finger is on the trigger as he snaps into his outie’s consciousness while riding a Lumon elevator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere are we, then? Here’s where various fan theories and open questions stand after “Cold Harbor.”\n\nWhat were all those numbers on Mark’s computer?\n\nThey were little pieces of Gemma’s consciousness. “The building blocks of her mind,” as Cobel told Mark’s innie.\n\nA lot of amateur theorists had pegged this one from the first episode of the season (or even before), when the show flashed a black-and-white picture of Gemma, looking like a testing subject, as Mark and his fellow macrodata refiners dragged numbers into boxes. We still don’t know exactly what makes numbers correspond to the categories Mark gave them, but we do know what those categories are: Mark was sorting them to correspond to Lumon cult founder Kier Eagan’s “Four Tempers” of woe, frolic, dread, and malice, which seems to be Lumon-speak for what are sometimes thought to be the four basic emotions: sadness, happiness, fear, and anger. Over his two years at Lumon, Mark has now reconstructed 25 different versions of Gemma’s mind, each representing its own innie when Gemma steps into a different testing room.\n\nWhat is Cold Harbor?\n\nThe final test of the 25 that Lumon has now run on Gemma. We saw some of the previous tests in Episode 7 of this season, when Gemma’s different innies were living life in an endless loop of dentist appointments, violently turbulent flights, and traumatic Christmas-card writing. I theorized then that Lumon was using Gemma to test consumer applications of the severance procedure, which could unburden people from the memories of painful or unpleasant moments. I still feel good about that theory after seeing what Lumon did to Gemma’s innie in “Cold Harbor,” the final test. The company had her disassemble a crib, calling back to her memory from Episode 7 of Mark taking apart a crib after Gemma miscarried during their marriage. (Lumon also played Billie Holiday’s take on “I’ll Be Seeing You,” a favorite of Mark and Gemma in their outie existence.) The couple’s fertility struggles set Gemma on the road to Lumon in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe severance barriers held even as Lumon put Gemma’s new innie through the most emotionally torturous test possible. Or at least they were holding, until Mark burst in. The Cold Harbor version of Gemma didn’t know who Mark’s outie was, and she initially threatened him with a piece of the crib, but she seemed to realize after a few seconds that Mark was at least a trustworthy person. Was this a case of love overpowering severance? Maybe! Once Gemma snapped into her outie self in the testing floor hallway, she and Mark finally had their moment back together in their own heads. It was sadly short.\n\nWhat makes Gemma’s case different from the standard severance procedure? Didn’t Mark’s severance also free him from his grief when he thought Gemma was dead?\n\nThe simple answer is that Gemma is being severed a lot. Mark has one innie, but Gemma has 25. Lumon may find both commercial and spiritual value in learning how to split a person’s brain into 25 different consciousnesses. With one innie, Lumon can free someone from the pain of work, or of birthing a child, but with as many as 25, Lumon may be able to achieve what seems to have been its ultimate goal since its days making ether: freedom from all pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy does Lumon have an indoor goat pasture on the severed floor?\n\nCobel had informed Mark’s outie in the previous episode that Gemma would die when Mark’s innie finished his Cold Harbor data refinement. We learned in the finale that not only was Lumon likely to slaughter Gemma once it was done with this last test but also—in perhaps a twist on Judeo-Christian tradition—a cute little goat.\n\nBack in the third episode of the season, we met Lush, the severed goat farmer played by Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie, a member of the Lumon department known as Mammalians Nurturable, and one of the most baffling questions since the show’s first season has been “What’s up with the goats?” We’ve now learned that the company has a dark, sacred vision for the goats. Lumon’s plan, Drummond tells Lush, is that Lumon will ceremonially sacrifice the goat and then “this beast will be entombed with a cherished woman whose spirit it must guide to Kier’s door.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the show may have begun to tell us what’s up with the goats, there are still questions. Recall that Lush asks Drummond, “How many more must I give?,” and earlier in the season, when Helena meets Mark’s outie, she mistakes Gemma’s name as “Hannah.” How many women has Lumon kidnapped and held for testing? How many goats has it slaughtered with them?\n\nWhy did Lumon’s CEO secretly father countless children?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Eagans are wildly creepy people, but it felt gross even by their standards to learn at the end of Episode 9 that current (and elderly) Lumon chief executive Jame Eagan (Michael Siberry) is a serial fatherer of new babies. “She’s one of Jame’s,” Cobel tells a security guard at the company’s severed birthing retreat, using the line to sneak outie Mark’s sister, Devon, into the facility with her.\n\nIt turns out that Jame believes his existing children, Helena included, are all disappointments. They do not remind him of Kier. But Helly, the innie version of his daughter, has the founder’s fire. Helly, the innie, now seems to be Jame’s pick to succeed him as the boss of the company. Not sure how that would work! Helly certainly would not want it anyway.\n\nWhat did Jame Eagan mean when he said that Helly had tricked him?\n\nIt was a popular theory over the past week that Helly, the innie, had somehow escaped Lumon’s severed floor for a second time and was cosplaying as her outie to sabotage Lumon from headquarters. Nope. When Jame entered the severed floor at the end of Episode 9 and told Helly, “You tricked me,” he was just referring to the end of Season 1, when Helly pretended to be her outie and then gave a speech at a Lumon gala about the company’s abuse of the innies. There was no fresh meat on that bone.\n\nIs Seth Milchick a company man or part of the resistance?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll season, Severance has seemed to lay the groundwork for Milchick to turn against Lumon and become an ally of Mark and the other innies. Early on in the season, the company gifts Milchick a painting of the very much not-Black founder, Kier, only with Black skin, so that Milchick can “see himself” in the tradition of the company. Milchick is visibly uncomfortable. Drummond castigates Milchick for using an elegant vocabulary, something Milchick might not be doing in the first place if not for his need to make a name for himself at an almost all-white company. The security boss blames Milchick for failures that aren’t his fault, and by Episode 9, Milchick has had enough, telling Drummond to “devour feculence.” In the finale, during a ridiculous company skit involving an animatronic statue of the founder, Milchick breaks character and notes that the real Kier was five inches shorter than the one that’s been wheeled onto the severed floor.\n\nRelated From Slate Severance​ Nails One Particularly Fraught Aspect of the Workplace Read More\n\nAnd yet. Milchick not only does nothing to help Mark bust out Gemma but tries hard to get in his way. For Milchick, the season ends in purgatory. Lumon is poised to punish him for letting Gemma get away, but the company might not even get the chance, because a bunch of severed marching-band musicians are holding Milchick hostage in MDR. Your employer doesn’t see you as family, Seth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat about the oft-theorized Lumon plan to build a whole severed workforce?\n\nA common fan theory holds that Lumon wants an army of severed workers, maybe ones who never leave the building and thus don’t even have outies. In this episode, we meet the marching band from Choreography and Merriment, a department we haven’t seen before. There are dozens of musicians in this band, and they comport themselves more or less like robots, not deviating from their act or acknowledging others’ speech until Helly and Dylan (Zach Cherry) convince them to stop their song and assist in the hostage-taking of Milchick. Maybe Lumon has more severed workers than we thought.\n\nIs full reintegration even possible? And is Mark still pursuing it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo idea. We haven’t seen Reghabi (Karen Aldridge), the former Lumon doctor who was helping to merge Mark’s two minds, since she had a falling-out with Devon in Episode 7. (Mark’s sis was not happy about the unsanctioned brain surgery the doctor was doing on her brother.) Mark ends the season not fully reintegrated, though he and his innie have started to see little glimpses of each other’s lives. Some of the questions that innie Mark asks outie Mark about reintegration also seem like awfully good ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs someone in outie Mark’s family spying on him for Lumon?\n\nProbably not. Lots of Severance fans are under the impression that Mark’s brother-in-law, Ricken—or maybe even his sister, Devon—is a Lumon mole keeping tabs on his outie. We get no whiff of that from Devon in the finale, as she helped plan what amounted to a second Macrodat Uprising, and Ricken was absent (save for flashbacks to Mark and Gemma’s old life) from the final few episodes of the season. Not every theory about this show will be a winner.\n\nWhere have you gone, Irving?\n\nIrving B. (John Turturro) has spent years trying to merge the memories of his innie and outie, and both versions of him have been among the most rebellious fighters against Lumon. The company knows what Irving is up to, and in Episode 9 of the season, Jame Eagan tells Helena, “We’re seeing to Mr. Bailiff.” Excitement about finally learning Irving’s last name aside, he was the target of a Lumon manhunt. The company likely would have killed him, but Irving’s innie love interest, Burt (Christopher Walken), drives him to a train station and sends him away. Burt is a low-level Lumon enforcer of some kind, but he feels an attachment to Irving on the outside as well as the inside. We see neither of them in the finale, and I’m not sure if we ever will again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy does the final shot of the season look exactly how it does?\n\nThe most heart-wrenching moment of the second season is its last. Innie Mark and Helly leave outie Gemma sobbing in an exit stairwell, rescued from Lumon’s torture but abandoned on the outside because innie Mark has decided to stay inside with the love of his tortured life, Helly. If Gemma can get all the way outside of Lumon’s office complex, she’ll be physically free after two years as a lab rat, but she’ll be alone in the same way her husband was when he thought she had died in a car crash. Plus, there’s always the threat that Lumon could “see to” her.\n\nWhat happens after Mark and Helly turn away from the exit caught my eye. The two characters are almost skipping down the hallways of the severed floor, laughing and holding hands. I might even call their movements frolicking. But in the episode’s closing seconds, two things happen. First, Mark and Helly’s smiles begin to fade. As with the runaway lovers in the famous final moments of The Graduate, it all dissolves to closing credits (and some very 1960s-styled credits at that) just as doubts seem to set in. (What is Lumon going to do to them now that they’ve led a second revolt and Mark has killed a high-level Lumon employee? Does Lumon even have any more use for them now that Cold Harbor is complete?) Second, the screen fades out to red, a color that, many have theorized, Severance typically uses to represent the outside world. I don’t think that color choice was merely because Mark was covered in Drummond’s blood. What is Severance telling us when it cuts from two innies to a red screen?\n\nAre you really going to spend the next year or two (or, Kier forbid, three) overanalyzing what it means that Severance chose to fade to red instead of black to end the second season?\n\nWell, this is Severance, so yes.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "When Leaving Neverland premiered on HBO a little over six years ago, the two-part, four-hour documentary sparked a long-overdue reckoning with the legacy of Michael Jackson. Composed largely of interviews with two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who say that Jackson repeatedly sexually abused them when they were children, the movie seemed to be the tipping point after nearly three decades of rumors, investigations, and out-of-court settlements, prompting a flood of media coverage that included more than a dozen articles in Slate alone. The #MeToo movement had, it seemed, inaugurated a cultural sea change. The rich and famous were no longer considered innocent by default, and their accusers were not immediately suspect. We would never see MJ the same way again.\n\nLeaving Neverland 2: Surviving Michael Jackson, director Dan Reed’s sequel to his bombshell documentary, was released on Tuesday. But this time, it was greeted with virtual silence. Whereas the first movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to a room packed with journalists, the second simply popped up on YouTube, less than a month after the entertainment industry trades broke the news of its existence. As of midafternoon Friday, it had 38,000 views.\n\nRelated From Slate The Most Revealing Thing in the New Michael Jackson Doc Isn’t the Allegations Read More\n\nAt a little over 53 minutes, Leaving Neverland 2 is more of an update than a self-contained work, mostly covering Robson and Safechuck’s attempts to pursue legal action against Jackson’s estate in the years since the first movie aired. But if you’re looking to refresh your memory of the original film, you’ll have to make do with the new one’s brief excerpts, because Leaving Neverland effectively no longer exists, at least in the U.S. Relying on a nondisparagement clause in a deal to air a 1992 concert, Jackson’s estate sued HBO for breach of contract, and after five years in court, the network agreed to a settlement that included permanently removing the movie from its Max streaming platform; although Leaving Neverland was released on DVD, the disc is now out of print, and a used copy is nearly $100 on eBay. (In an unexpected twist, you can still stream the film in the U.K., where plaintiff-friendly libel laws usually make it much more difficult to report on public figures, and the second part was broadcast on Channel 4 this week.) MJ, the stage musical based on Jackson’s life, was nominated for 10 Tonys and is now in its fourth year on Broadway; the Cirque du Soleil spectacle set to his music is still running in Las Vegas; and a Hollywood biopic, directed by Training Day’s Antoine Fuqua, has already been filmed, though its release date is uncertain. #MeToo has become #NeverMind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn its own, Leaving Neverland 2 is, unfortunately, not much to speak of. At Sundance, Reed said that he shot interviews with attorneys on both sides of the case but opted not to use them, focusing exclusively on Robson, Safechuck, and the families. In the sequel, lawyers take center stage. Vince Finaldi and John Manly, whose California practice specializes in civil litigation related to sexual abuse, ably guide us through the basis of their lawsuit, which alleges that the companies Jackson formed to manage his affairs should be held liable for his actions even after his death. But while they convey a sense of dedication to the cause, they can’t be as compelling as Jackson’s alleged victims themselves.\n\nFor years, Jackson and his representatives, both legal and public, have argued that his accusers are motivated solely by the desire for money. (The Hollywood biopic is reportedly mired in legal issues because its third act depicts the family of Jordan Chandler, the then-13-year-old who accused Jackson of sexual abuse in 1993, as money-grubbing opportunists.) And they’ve pointed to the fact that Robson and Safechuck both defended Jackson in court. Leaving Neverland devotes a good chunk of its length to explaining why they lied under oath, and although the sequel repeats that explanation in truncated form, it takes time to walk an audience through the emotional logic of defending your alleged abuser, time this brief addendum doesn’t have. As for being in it for the money: With Jackson dead, there aren’t many avenues for justice available to his alleged victims except for the monetary rewards of a civil judgment and the attendant public vindication. And even if their motivations are financial, his estate’s seem unlikely to be less so—especially since megastars like Jackson are most profitable when they’re reinjected into the culture over and over again, and that’s a lot harder to do when the good feelings associated with their songs become associated with a toxic personal brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat’s why the most fascinating part of Leaving Neverland 2 has almost nothing to do with Robson and Safechuck. After years of failing to get an on-camera response from Jackson’s estate or his family, Reed turns instead to his fans, who are as much the guardians of his legacy as anyone who holds the rights. Most take Jackson’s side, of course, with one suggesting that Leaving Neverland, which went to almost unbearable lengths to describe when and how Jackson allegedly abused his victims, didn’t go into enough specifics to be convincing. (A clearly stunned Reed asks, off camera, “That wasn’t detailed enough for you?”) But one, a middle-aged Black man identified only as “Z,” says that watching the original documentary set him on a path of questioning and reinvestigating everything he thought he knew. And when he dug around, he says, “I didn’t like what I saw.” It’s a reminder of how powerful the impact of Leaving Neverland was, and of how ominous it is that, at a time when media access is under the near-total control of streaming conglomerates, it’s possible for a movie of such historic and cultural importance to simply disappear.",

My son was running after a ball when the dog ran across the yard, knocked him over, and attacked. Luckily, he was bundled up in layers and a puffer coat. His clothes were ruined, and he had nasty bruising on his neck, shoulder, and upper torso from the bites, but his skin wasn’t broken. It would’ve been so much worse if it had happened in warmer weather.\n\nOf course, I reported the attack to the county and gave my brother a heads-up. Well, he was LIVID and said a lot of hurtful, dismissive things to me, even comparing his dog to my son in terms of importance. We had a falling out over his reaction. (By the way, nothing even happened to the damn dog besides the dog warden coming to talk to my brother.) Before this, my brother and I got along fine but weren’t close. Most of my son’s contact with him has been at family gatherings with my parents. I have decided we won’t be going to any gatherings with my brother for the time being. His callous, selfish response to my son’s attack has shaken me.\n\nMy parents “don’t want to get in the middle of it” and invited both our families to Easter as long as the dog doesn’t come.\n\nShould I explain to my son why we aren’t going to Easter at Grandma and Grandpa’s like we usually do?

He found the score of all scores in his mind—a signed Mr. Beast T-shirt, sized large, with a signature and a doodle of a snake. One of his friends resells thrift finds and told him he could make $300 reselling the shirt. He bought it. He brought it home. He was so excited. Well, I washed it. He told me it was valuable, but I washed it anyway because it was from a thrift store. And … the T-shirt isn’t really signed anymore. You can just make out the faded marks of what once was. (I have a picture if that helps.) He went from so happy to completely crestfallen. I don’t know what to do.

Since adolescence, he’s exclusively gone barefoot and has only worn shoes that mimic the barefoot experience. As a result, his feet are so hideous that when I first met him, they put me off. On top of having soles like hooves, his toes are all splayed so far apart that his whole foot forms a ducklike triangle instead of a standard foot shape. He maintains, however, that what we think of as a “foot” shape is caused by wearing shoes that are not properly formed to the “natural” human foot. He’s tried to get me on board with this, but he respected my “no, thanks.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that we’re engaged, he’s been bringing it up again. I don’t want to tell him I find his giant wide-toed shoes and feet ugly because it’s such a small thing to accept for someone I love everything else about. But now he’s saying he wants to raise our kids the same way! I am very against this, especially if we have a girl. It’s bad enough for a man, but feet like his would be a serious problem for a woman.

Tell him that you will not be raising your children to be constantly barefoot or to wear special shoes, and that it’s not up for debate. Explain to him that the social consequences would be too great for most children to bare and that you do not intend to put your kids through that. Remind him that his unique line of work allows him to indulge in his practice, but that it wouldn’t be acceptable in most schools or workplaces. Refuse to budge; your husband is lucky someone was willing to look past his feet (I have so many questions about how you did!) and accept him in the first place. It’s absolutely absurd for him to expect that he should pass this behavior on to another generation.\n\n—Jamilah",

        "content": "In the cold, barren world of Severance, Lumon Industries is capital-E Evil. The corporation is responsible for such atrocities as employing child labor, leaving a small town kneecapped by ether addiction, and abducting at least one woman for a yearslong experiment in which she’s subjected to painful tests and then doomed to die. It doesn’t help that the company was founded by a guy who imbued Lumon with a cult-like mysticism—complete with wackadoodle beliefs about man’s four tempers, goat sacrifice, and weird sex stuff—and continues to be run by his equally maladjusted descendants.\n\nWhat to make of Lumon’s crowning glory is more complex. Severance, the medical procedure of splitting a person’s mind and memories, is the corporation’s main offering, sold as a pioneering method to achieve work-life balance, offload the trauma of childbirth, and, as suggested in the show’s second season, ultimately rid the world of pain overall—at least, for the “outies” who consent to transfer all such unpleasantness to their unconsenting “innie” selves. This is shown to be controversial in their universe, alternately regarded with curiosity and disgust by members of the public. To Severance viewers, severance is naturally taken as immoral; we see that it’s the root of so much anguish in our favorite innies, as they spend every waking moment of their limited existence in a sterile, windowless office, refining data and wondering what it’s like to really live.\n\nThe wrinkle, though, is that without severance, of course, the innies would not exist at all—and, as my colleague Sam Adams writes for Slate, we like the innies, with whom we spend most of our time. They are who their outies would be if they weren’t burdened by external factors, like grief, duty, and familial baggage; in other words, they are pure, like newborn lambs in comparison to their outer selves. What we are left with, then, is an ethical quandary: Is it better for the innies to have been born to be used and eventually discarded than to never have been born at all?\n\nThe Season 2 finale, which hit Apple TV+ on Thursday night, brings this question to the forefront. “Cold Harbor” caps off Mark S.’s (Adam Scott) search for his outie’s captive wife, a quest that has taken place while his innie falls in love with a fellow innie co-worker (who also happens to be the daughter of Lumon’s CEO, whoops). The core tension the show has been inching toward this season is not so much employer versus employee, but innie versus outie—self versus self. This conflict had already been teased in previous episodes: Innie worker Dylan G. (Zach Cherry) had an affair with his outie’s wife, and even earlier, innie Helly R. (Britt Lower) engaged in an escalating war with her outie, Lumon heir Helena Eagan, over control of their shared body and personhood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the season finale, outie Mark has to convince innie Mark to save his wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman) from Lumon’s clutches. The conversation, conducted via video messages left for each other on a camcorder, is rocky: Outie Mark is unable to convincingly answer innie Mark’s question about what will happen if they escape from Lumon and end severance—will the innies just cease to exist? (Irving B., an innie colleague played magnificently by John Turturro, had effectively “died” in an earlier episode after a dramatic firing.) At one point, outie Mark apologizes for putting innie Mark through the hell that is Lumon’s severed floor, a sentiment that his other self can’t entirely accept—innie Mark’s life may be restricted, but, ultimately, he does wish to continue living it. In fact, if outie Mark had never made the terrible and cruel decision to severe, innie Mark—and the joy he manages to experience in his captivity—wouldn’t exist at all.\n\nSuch a paradox has been posed and debated in the sphere of animal rights. The “logic of the larder,” as coined by noted British vegetarian and social-reform campaigner Henry S. Salt in the 1914 book The Humanities of Diet, is an objection to the argument, presented by meat eaters, that the slaughter of animals is justified because “it is better for them to live and to be butchered than not to live at all.” The argument is a fallacy; as Salt writes, this positioning of life as the ultimate “boon” is born of carnivores’ self-interest in continuing to eat meat, and has been used by slavers to justify breeding slaves, would justify any parental mistreatment of children, and could even be applied by cannibals to defend breeding their own human victims. Yet this conclusion is hard to swallow when it comes to Severance, where the severed employees, with their labor and ultimate demise, are akin to the goats that Lumon rears to be ritually slaughtered. Again, we love the innies! There would be no show to watch if they had never been created!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate All the Revelations in Severance’s Supersize Finale, Explained Read More\n\nOne can imagine a scenario where innies exist, and do work, but are allowed to experience fulfillment, too, before they are led to slaughter (aka, their outies quit working at Lumon). That would be something like “benign carnivorism,” as termed by American philosopher Jeff McMahan in a 2008 article for the academic journal Dædalus. In Severance, that might look a little something like waffle parties, family visitation sessions, and team retreats, which Mr. Milchick (Tramell Tillman) bestows upon his severed employees in an attempt to enrich their working lives and improve their morale (thus increasing productivity). Which is to say: It’s what Lumon sort of attempts to do, and it is not necessarily great. Even if the amenities were better, this, too, is ethically insufficient. “If we give farm animals good lives, it presumably means that they like their lives and want to keep living—so how do we justify killing them?” Rhys Southan writes in a 2016 Aeon essay that has stayed with me since I first read it years ago. McMahan, meanwhile, concludes that, even with the animals raised “in humane conditions,” it would still be morally unjustifiable because “the interest the animals would have in not being killed would decisively outweigh the interest people would have in killing and eating them.” No matter how many marching-band dance celebrations Milchick organizes, it wouldn’t change the fact that the innies are slaughterhouse animals, and their desire to not be killed one day fundamentally outweighs Lumon’s interest in using and discarding them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor all the fascinating parallels there may be between these philosophical debates and Severance’s core paradox, though, the texture of this consideration inevitably changes once you weigh in innie Mark’s camcorder message assertion: that the innies are people, too, with their own minds, hearts, and shreds of agency clawed back from their oppressors—not just Lumon, but even more critically, their outies. At the end of the Season 2 finale, innie Mark is faced with a choice: to leave with Gemma and give up his life for his outie’s happiness, or to stay in the slaughterhouse, thereby depriving his outie of his life, and relish however long he may have left of his existence with Helly? Either way, he will almost certainly end up “dead.” The difference is in his autonomy before the executioner’s block. As Mark makes his choice and frolics down the hallway hand in hand with Helly, they look like euphoric goats leaping over a fence. However complicated our feelings are about their existence, it’s hard not to root for the farm animals to escape.",

        "content": "Pay Dirt is Slate’s money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Kristin and Ilyce here. (It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nMy sister and I both live in the Midwest. Her son lives locally but her daughter lives on the West Coast, and makes six figures—but the rising cost of living in the area eats up most of her salary. My sister can’t seem to wrap her brain around it. She expects her daughter to shell out whatever cash she needs at the moment.\n\nAt the same time, she will shower whatever funds she does have on her son because “he has it so hard.” (My nephew is a bum and pothead and can’t keep a steady job. ) Her recent wild financial ask of my niece finally brought all these issues to a head.\n\nMy sister got severe storm damage but didn’t want to file a claim since it would cause her rates to go up. Instead, she harassed her daughter to send her twenty grand. My niece sent half the money but said she couldn’t afford anymore. This caused a huge fight, and my niece blocked her mother all together.\n\nMy sister would not shut up about the subject, so I finally snapped. I told her she would have the money if she wasn’t constantly bailing out her son, both figuratively and literally. My nephew has a wrap sheet as long as his arm and the police know him. My niece’s rent is more than both our combined mortgages. My own children live in areas with high costs of living, and struggle to make ends meet—and they both have good careers and spouses to support them. But my niece is alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of hearing me out, my sister didn’t talk to me for a week. Now she is acting like our conversation never happened and back to complaining about how her rich child refuses to help her out. Is it even worth wasting my breath by bringing this up?\n\n—Midwest Money\n\nDear Midwest,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt sounds like your niece could use an advocate. And while it probably does feel like wasting your breath, it’s also not a good idea to let things fester. If your sister’s behavior is rubbing you the wrong way, I would try again to have a conversation about it, but maybe approach the topic more delicately this time.\n\nIn other words, instead of snapping at your sister (and calling her son a bum), try to actively listen to her to see where she’s coming from. Why does it bother her so much that her daughter won’t bail her out? And why is it so important for her to, ironically, bail her son out? Why doesn’t she think the cost of living offsets her daughter’s salary? You don’t have to agree with any of these answers, and many of them are probably ill-informed, but listen to your sister to understand her reasoning. It sounds like she might have some unhealthy associations with money. To your sister, a salary might represent self-worth, and seeing her high-earning daughter not passing on the wealth that she assumes she must have might feel condescending or like a betrayal. I’m not saying it’s right, but people often get ideas like this about money that can warp their logic. Once you understand where she’s coming from, even if you don’t agree with it, you can better advocate for your niece and probably get through to your sister as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhatever her reasoning is, your sister might be in a better place to hear you out if she feels understood. Once you’ve established that understanding, you can try to explain your perspective and see how she takes it. If she doesn’t take it well, then fine, you’re wasting your breath and might want to avoid the topic altogether. In that case, let her know. Tell her you see her daughter’s side of things, it upsets you that she doesn’t, and that it might be best to avoid the topic altogether.\n\nAlso, how close are you to your niece? Maybe give her a call. She’s probably feeling her own big feelings right now, and it might be nice to know that someone else in the family has her back. These kinds of family dynamics can be tough on a person—especially when it’s our parents—and your niece might need validation from an outsider that her mother is being unfair.\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

Dear Pay Dirt, * Your letter signoff Your pronouns Your email (optional and confidential—please include if you're open to Pay Dirt following up) Submit\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nLike a lot of financial rookies, I opened an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), set up an automatic monthly contribution, and didn’t realize until much later that you then have to choose where to invest that money. There’s now several thousand dollars in the account just sitting there not doing anything. My question is: Is it a good idea to invest it now that the economy is tanking? I’m decades away from retirement so I’m not worried about my investments making a bunch of money right now or really any time in the near future. My (again, rookie) assumption is that investing now means it would buy more shares, then I’ll be in better shape when the economy finally recovers.\n\n—It Really Accumulates?\n\nDear Accumulates,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes! Apologies for the pun, but you’re right on the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo give readers a little background, it sounds like you did all the right things—opened a retirement account and scheduled automatic savings from, let’s say, a checking account. But you skipped the part where you have to designate specific funds for investing that money, so it was just sitting there, not growing as you’d intended. Look, you could be worse off: you still have that money in the retirement account, and you’ve built up the important habit of regularly making contributions to it.\n\nYou’re absolutely right, the best time to start investing for your future is now. There’s a saying: It’s time in the market, not timing the market. In other words, the sooner you start investing, the better, because you give your money more time to grow. The stock market has a long history of highs and lows, but gradually, over time, it’s steadily increased, and most average, non-billionaires like you and me build wealth by holding these investments for a long while, giving them time to grow.\n\nWhile past performance doesn’t guarantee future return, all we can do is use the information we have available to make the best decision we can. The stock market has tanked many times in the past, and it’s always recovered. In fact, even if timing the market was a good idea, now would theoretically be the best time to start investing because prices are lower than usual. You can think of it as stocks being on sale. (There’s conflicting data on whether or not timing the market this way really makes a difference in the long term, but if it helps put your mind at ease then perhaps it’s useful to think about it like that.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour financial institution should make it easy to get started investing in a broad fund — meaning, an investment fund that spreads your money over a wide range of assets, industries, or sectors instead of just focusing on one area. This gives you some diversification, meaning if one part of the market isn’t doing well, other parts might balance it out. Think of it like a buffet—you’re getting a little bit of everything instead of just one dish. As they say, you don’t want to put all of your eggs in one basket. If you need more help getting started, I like this step-by-step beginner’s guide. Happy saving!\n\n—Kristin",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Halfway through the newly released 12th episode of The Pitt, Max’s hit medical drama set in a hospital emergency department, the injured ex-husband of Dr. Cassie McKay (Fiona Dourif) hobbles on crutches into the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Hospital emergency room, before stopping in his tracks, the color draining from his face. Having been injured in a skateboarding accident, Chad (Rob Heaps) has found his way from an upstairs room back to the ER in order to search for his young son, who is waiting in a break room for his mom to finish her shift. But the scene Chad encounters is one of chaos and carnage: Dozens of gunshot victims—some conscious, most not—occupy seemingly every available bed and chair; doctors and nurses rush from patient to patient, wearing disposable white medical gowns that are now splattered a deep red; cleaning teams race to mop up pools of blood scattered across the floor before new ones inevitably form. There has been a mass shooting at a music festival; this is the immediate, horrific aftermath.\n\nAs I saw the shell-shocked Chad bear witness to these graphic scenes of death and gore, I felt an instant sense of kinship. His reaction mirrored my own as I watched what instantly felt like one of the most remarkable and important episodes of television I’d seen in years—perhaps ever. As mass shootings have slowly become part of the grim background of American life—with a media that is unwilling or unable to show the public the true horrors of, say, what a semiautomatic weapon can do to a person’s body—this episode of The Pitt, dramatized fiction as it may be, is urgent, necessary viewing, something everyone in the country needs to take in.\n\nFrom the beginning of the season, it has felt as if The Pitt was building to this storyline, albeit somewhat clunkily. Throughout their 15-hour shift, Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch (Noah Wyle) and Dr. McKay have been sparring over what to do about David Saunders (Jackson Kelly), the clearly troubled teenager whose mother, Theresa (Joanna Going), has been brought to the ER under the guise of needing treatment. Instead, Theresa confesses that she faked her illness after discovering a notebook belonging to her son in which he’d written down the names of girls at his school that he wanted to “eliminate.” After David flees the hospital, while his mother remains for several episodes of tortured debate about whether to involve police, it felt obvious that it was only a matter of time before something gun-related happened in the show, even if it wasn’t yet clear whether David was the music-festival mass shooter. What felt even more predictable was that Jake (Taj Speights), Dr. Robby’s former stepson, would somehow end up caught in the crossfire; the lovestruck teen’s narrative arc about taking his new girlfriend to the festival felt like prime material that the writers couldn’t resist turning into tragedy drawn from real events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Everyone’s New Favorite Medical Drama Is Not Like ER in One Important Way Read More\n\nGiven all this heavy foreshadowing, I had honestly been dreading this pivot. It felt inevitable for the show to build toward some sort of major disaster as the season nears its end. But part of the appeal of The Pitt has been the way in which it eschews traditional TV tropes. There are no real workplace romances to speak of, as in Grey’s Anatomy, and there’s no overbearing musical score used to heighten tension, as in ER. Instead, because of its unique structure (every episode is one hour of the emergency shift), The Pitt feels something like medical drama cinéma vérité. Indeed, the show has found fans in real-world medical workers who have praised its authenticity. Wouldn’t such a plotline seem like, well, just too TV? Thanks to deft treatment and trademark Pitt realism, however, the answer is a resounding no.\n\nSome of the episode’s most tense moments fall right at the start, before any gunshot victims arrive, as the Pitt staff, after learning of the news, kicks into “Code Triage” mode and begins to silently contemplate just what might be coming. As the nearest hospital to the festival, Pitt’s ER is likely to get the majority of the victims. “Expect the worst,” Dr. Robby tells his team. In these tense moments of eerie calm before the storm, we see hospital protocols swing into action: Drums of extra supplies are wheeled in, extra operating rooms are prepared, patients in the waiting room are told to leave for urgent care centers, and ER staff phone loved ones, not knowing when they might be able to return home. This will be “no-frills combat-zone medicine,” Dr. Jack Abbot (Shawn Hatosy) instructs the staff: no X-rays, no CT scans, no ultrasounds, no lab tests. They will need to think fast and on the fly. The new 10-second triage system will involve giving patients color-coded wristbands that denote whether they will die within five minutes or an hour—or whether they’re already dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe muscle memory by which the hospital now appears to be running is no fluke but the result of training, preparation, and experience drawn from reality. When two teen gunmen opened fire at a charter school in Colorado in 2019, members of the local hospital staff there found themselves treating young victims of a school shooting for the third time in their careers. In 2018 doctors in Tennessee treated victims of three separate mass shootings in just seven months. As mass shootings become more common, medical workers’ responses become almost second nature—although no less depressing and traumatic.\n\nAs the sound of the sirens draws closer, the inevitable crush finally arrives, and with it an onslaught rarely if ever depicted on television in such graphic detail. The first dead person turns up within seconds. Other victims have deep wounds from bullets that have blown chunks through their abdomens. In one case, a person’s intestines hang out. Amid the naked, bloody bodies, we see the staff thrusting tubes into the head of a penis and quite literally drilling intravenous holes into people’s arms, all in the name of efficiency and expediency. Still, the number of dead piles up. Until this point in the season, episodes of The Pitt have ebbed and flowed between fast-paced moments of intense treatments, as patients suddenly flatline, and quieter moments of reflection, even levity, as the staffers form bonds with patients and each other. Now, however, there is no relenting from the pandemonium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid the mayhem, two haunting images stood out for me. In the first, we see bloody handprints lining the side of an arriving ambulance; they’re the marks of desperate people who had been clawing at the already full emergency vehicle, we’re told. In the second, we observe a woman sitting in a wheelchair, a gunshot wound in her arm. Clearly in a state of severe shock that has left her unable to speak, all she can do is silently cry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s no secret that U.S. gun violence is a humanmade epidemic without parallel in the world. The American Public Health Association has declared it a public health crisis and a leading cause of premature death. Guns are also the leading cause of death for American children and teenagers. In 2023 nearly 47,000 people died from gun-related injuries in the U.S., according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the third-highest number in recorded history, bested only by the two preceding years.\n\nRelated From Slate Netflix’s New No. 1 Hit Is One of the Best Shows of the Year Read More\n\nBut these statistics, familiar as they are, can no longer fully convey the scale of horror that befalls gunshot victims and the medical professionals tasked with treating them. The public has simply become too desensitized to headlines about mass carnage in schools, supermarkets, and workplaces. For that reason, there has been debate among the media for years now about whether publishing graphic images of gaping wounds or bloody classrooms might help awaken people to the scale of the crisis. (We even hear a TV reporter make that case to a security guard in this very episode.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s time, with the permission of a surviving parent, to show what a slaughtered 7-year-old looks like,” David Boardman, Temple University’s journalism school dean and former executive editor of the Seattle Times, tweeted after the massacre of 19 elementary school students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022.\n\n“Maybe the shock to the system would prompt our leaders to figure out how to make sure society can stop these troubled men … from obtaining these weapons used to slaughter our children,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told viewers after that same mass shooting.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine what grieving parent, if any, would agree to the publication of such images—and who can blame them? It’s not on them to stop the slaughter; it’s on our elected leaders. Perhaps it’s those people, then, who should be forced to see such disturbing images prior to every vote they cast in accordance with the wishes of the National Rifle Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the rest of us, for now, there’s The Pitt. It’s hardly the first medical show to depict the aftermath of a mass shooting, but it might be the most realistic and visceral, and for that reason, it may have the most potential to cut deep and spur change. I can only hope that everyone who watches it undergoes the same transformation as one of the show’s own characters, Dr. John Shen (Ken Kirby). When Dr. Robby appoints Shen, the night shift attending physician, to act as the point person for triaging victims in the ambulance bay, he seems much too calm for Dr. Robby’s liking. Sipping an iced coffee, Dr. Shen even wonders if it might rain later that day. By the episode’s end, though, he is covered in blood and worried for his own safety amid chatter that the shooter might be headed their way. He seems truly overwhelmed when Dr. Robby tells him there may still be twice as many victims to come. “Jesus,” Dr. Shen mutters. “When is this going to end?” That’s a question for us watching at home too.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "This article contains spoilers for Happy Face.\n\nParamount+’s new series Happy Face seeks to be both a true-crime drama and a critique of the genre—having its cake and eating it too, dramatically speaking. The series is based on a memoir and spinoff podcast by Melissa G. Moore, and explores her coming to terms with learning Keith Jesperson, the father she loved and adored as a child, led a double life as the notorious “Happy Face” serial killer (so dubbed due to his fondness for leaving confessions signed with a happy face at the scene of his crimes).\n\nHowever, the focus of the series is not really on Jesperson’s crimes and bringing him to justice (he’s already serving a life sentence when the story starts), but rather on the rippling impact of the murders on members of the victims’ wider families, including young people who were not yet born when the crimes took place. This bit of time-bending allows the story room to explore Moore’s own complex family dynamics.\n\nAt the same time, the series looks at how the expanding (and lucrative) true-crime media ecology has turned psychopaths into objects of fascination and, if not actual role models, at least cult figures … even as Happy Face itself contributes to this phenomenon. (It’s worth noting that it could be argued this has been happening since the days of Jack the Ripper.) In any case, here we look at this account of a daughter coming to terms with loving an evil father to determine where it’s myth-building and where it’s myth-busting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Melissa Accidentally Stumble Into Investigative Crime Reporting as a Makeup Artist for a Dr. Phil–Like Television Show?\n\nIn the series, Melissa Reed (Annaleigh Ashford) is working as a makeup artist for the Dr. Greg Show, a sort of Dr. Phil/Dr. Oz–like talk show where the charismatic Dr. Greg (David Harewood) provides informal counseling, in front of a live audience, to people dealing with some kind of psychological trauma, including those who have lost a loved one to violence. One day, Melissa’s estranged father, the convicted serial killer Keith Jesperson (Dennis Quaid)—who is serving time for eight femicides—phones the show wanting to confess to one more murder, but says he will only confide the details to Melissa.\n\nMelissa wants no contact with her father, but Dr. Greg is naturally thrilled to have an inside line to this juicy story and gets his ambitious producer, Ivy, to convince Melissa to cooperate by pointing out that Keith’s revelations might help another family find closure, which results in the two going to visit Keith in an Oregon penitentiary. Although Melissa is determined not to let Keith back into her life, he lures her in by telling her that his ninth victim was a bartender he picked up when he came across her hitchhiking in Texas. When Melissa learns that the bartender’s boyfriend is on death row for the murder and awaiting imminent execution, she and Ivy feel obligated to get the case reopened. They start interviewing people connected to the case, and Melissa proves to be a natural journalist, knowing when to confront and when to back off and possessing a remarkable ability to get people to open up to her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe real Melissa G. Moore never worked for a Dr. Phil–like show in any capacity or, as far as is known, worked in the media at all prior to 2008. Nor has there ever been a nationally syndicated talk show hosted by a doctor emanating from the Pacific Northwest. Moore did get to know psychologist Phil “Dr. Phil” McGraw in June 2008 when she attended a “Get Real Retreat,” an intense three-day therapy session hosted by McGraw. McGraw had suggested Moore attend after she wrote to him in desperation asking if she should continue to have a relationship with her father. McGraw advised her to have nothing more to do with Keith (unlike the series’ Dr. Greg, who, again, suggests she resume contact for the sake of the show).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor 15 years, the secret of Moore’s past had been known only to her husband and her best friend. However, she later said the Get Real Retreat helped her to stop feeling shame and open up about her situation, recalling, “I went on the retreat to find out if I should have a relationship with my father. I know that sounds absurd now, but I was receiving letters and I felt so guilty as a daughter. He was my father and didn’t have a conscience; he didn’t show remorse for the victims. I took it upon myself to feel that burden, that guilt, for him, and I didn’t realize I did that.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Melissa Really Refuse to Capitalize on Her 15 Minutes of Fame?\n\nIn the series, after Melissa’s appearance on his show generates a huge public response, Dr. Greg invites her and her husband, Ben (James Wolk), to dinner with him and his wife. Expecting a casual dinner party, Melissa arrives at Dr. Greg’s impressive home to find an array of terrifyingly well-groomed people who turn out to be Dr. Greg’s television agent, his literary agent, a film producer, his social media agent, and all the other enablers of a modern media career. They all seem to want to get to know her and are hungry for more salacious details of her father’s crimes and what it was like to live with a serial killer. Pleading a headache, Melissa leaves the dinner early, although Dr. Greg reminds her: “This is your moment,” and says that she should seize the opportunity. Melissa insists she has no interest in a big media career and just wants to get the man wrongly convicted for what she thinks was her father’s crime exonerated and then go back to normal life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn reality, after a November 2008 appearance on the Dr. Phil show based on her therapy at the Get Real Retreat, Melissa was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show and a 20/20 special on ABC. She appeared in an episode of the true-crime television series Evil Lives Here and was a correspondent for a program called Crime Watch Daily. Far from dismissing the suggestion that she write a book, as she does in the series, she did exactly that at Dr. Phil’s urging and in 2009 published Shattered Silence: The Untold Story of a Serial Killer’s Daughter, which led to the Oprah interview that really put her on the media map. She then followed this up with two more books, both around the theme of recovering from a bad upbringing and childhood trauma. She also produced two true-crime podcast series—Happy Face and Life After Happy Face—and helped create the A&E series Monster in My Family, which explores how being connected to notorious criminals has affected the lives of individual people.\n\nAccording to Moore, she was motivated not by finding fame but by helping others, telling the BBC in 2014, “After I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show in 2009, I received hundreds of emails from family members of other serial killers thanking me for telling my story, and asking for help and advice.” She also said she has created a network of more than 300 people who are related to killers, to whom she speaks both on the phone and in person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Moore’s Investigations Overturn a Death Penalty Verdict?\n\nIn the show, Melissa and Ivy discover that the ninth victim Keith told them he killed was not only a bartender, but a talented singer-songwriter named Heather. They further discover (as mentioned above) that Heather’s then-boyfriend, Elijah, another musician, was convicted of her murder and has been on death row for decades, although he has always maintained his innocence. They team up with Elijah’s sister, who has advocated tirelessly for her brother over many years. After many twists and turns, including uncovering a corrupt district attorney who arranged for DNA evidence to disappear and finding that Keith arranged for evidence to be fabricated to connect him to the crime, they prove Elijah’s innocence. Then, displaying nearly Sherlockian detecting skills, Melissa deduces who the real killer is and manages to get a confession from him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn reality, there was no Heather and thus no Elijah. Most of Jesperson’s victims were sex workers and transients whom he picked up when they were hitchhiking, not aspiring musicians. As for the wrong person being locked up, the show’s creators appear to have done some conflating with the case of Jesperson’s first victim, a young woman named Taunja Bennett, whom he raped and killed in 1990 in Portland, Oregon. At first, he got away with the murder because a local woman named Laverne Pavlinac told police she had helped her partner John Sosnovske rape and kill Bennett—she later confessed that she had invented the confession to get revenge against Sosnovske for domestic abuse. The lead detective on the case told the Netflix true-crime program Catching Killers that he genuinely believed the “grandmotherly” (she was 57) Pavlinac’s story. Both Pavlinac and Sosnovske were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurious that someone else had claimed “credit” for his work, Jesperson (a long-distance trucker) left “confessions” for the authorities scrawled on the bathroom walls of truck stops and wrote letters to various media outlets, signing each one with the smiley face that gave him his tabloid name. All were ignored, but one six-page missive, in which he confessed to subsequent murders, saying, “She was my first, and I thought I would not do it again. But I was wrong,” went to the Oregonian. There, investigative journalist Phil Stanford did take him seriously and wrote several columns alleging that Pavlinac and Sosnovske had been wrongly convicted.\n\nThen, in March 1994, Jesperson was arrested for the murder of another victim and confessed to seven other murders, including Bennett’s. After he provided details of her murder that only the killer could have known, even the state prosecutors were asking for the couple, who by now had served five years, to be freed. Meanwhile, Taunja Bennett’s sister became an outspoken critic of how the case had been handled as it resulted in the real murderer escaping justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Melissa’s Father Kill Her Kittens?\n\nAt Dr. Greg’s dinner party, Melissa recounts a chilling story of caring for some kittens in the basement as a child until her father found them and hung them by their tails from a clothesline as an anguished Melissa watched, her father smiling as the kittens writhed and scratched themselves to death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis actually happened. As Moore told the BBC, “When I was 5, I found these beautiful little kittens in the cellar of our farmhouse and I took them outside to play with. When my dad saw what I had in my hands he took them, casually hung them up on the clothesline, and began to torment them. I remembered his enjoyment as I screamed and pleaded with him to take them down. Later on, I found their little bodies in the back garden.” Furthermore, in common with many serial killers, Jesperson had a history of torturing animals dating back to childhood.\n\nIs There Really a Market for Jesperson’s Art?\n\nThe series shows Keith making contact with his granddaughter Hazel, whom Melissa has tried to keep unaware of his existence, by sending her a hand-drawn birthday card. As the two clandestinely start talking by phone, he sends her several drawings. Hazel, something of an outcast, is delighted to find that rather than attacking her for having a serial killer as a grandfather, the class mean girls think it’s cool, and the cute boy she has a crush on offers to let her use his internet payment account if she wants to sell the drawings online. It turns out there is a viable market for Keith’s artwork, not only from internet buyers but also from a museum devoted to serial killers.\n\nAlthough it is not known if Moore’s daughter (who is not called Hazel) ever contacted her grandfather, there is indeed a market for Jesperson’s drawings, with works selling for up to $600. There are also no fewer than three museums in the U.S. exhibiting memorabilia connected to serial killers—one with locations in Hollywood and New Orleans, one in North Carolina, and one in Tennessee.",

        "content": "Suzanne Collins’ new Hunger Games prequel, Sunrise on the Reaping, is the first installment in the series since 2020’s The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and its publication has been a hotly anticipated event. Now BookTok is flooded with fresh-faced, enthusiastic people declaring their absolute, complete “Suzanne Collins, run me over with a truck!!!” big feelings about it. Readers are reacting with huge eyes to the revelation of certain plot developments, watching the movies on laptops and letting out little sobs when noticing moments that hit different after reading the prequel, or finishing the book and wilting into little piles on the floor. “SUZANNE STOP IT” is the consensus review—which is, I think, positive. (The New York Times liked it too.)\n\nIt’s not fair for an outsider to BookTok to mock their ways, but I describe these instant, days-after-publication overreactions to illustrate how much things have changed since Collins published her first Hunger Games book in September 2008, two months before Barack Obama was elected. No TikTok, no Instagram, baby Twitter, baby Tumblr, Donald Trump still on The Apprentice, people just beginning to habituate themselves to the fandom habits of the social-media internet. The grim vibes of Collins’ first book—a future America where the government forces teenagers to kill one another on television—felt hypothetical, and the story was delicious entertainment with good stakes and really good world-building. Fans put their hair in braids and took archery lessons; Scholastic’s bean-counters rejoiced.\n\nThese days the copycat dystopias that Hunger Games inspired have fallen out of favor. Publishing and marketing professionals have declared that the people want escapism. Other books on BookTok’s mind right now, like Leigh Rivers’ “dark romance” Edge of Darkness trilogy, Laura Pavlov’s small-town romance My Silver Lining, or Lynn Painter’s YA contemporary romance Better Than the Movies, are, well, romantic. There is a romance in Sunrise on the Reaping, but I’m not spoiling anything when I tell you it’s doomed; instead of reading along toward our guaranteed happy ending, we Hunger Games fans already know the main character will end up alone. Yet it’s clear that readers are finding a kind of catharsis in Sunrise that feels as volatile as it does camera-ready. What’s in this book that’s making people freak out like this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur hero in Sunrise is Haymitch Abernathy, victor of the 50th Hunger Games. For those who last consumed Panem content a decade ago, the 50th Hunger Games take place 24 years before Katniss Everdeen volunteered as tribute. Haymitch, like Katniss and the other points on her love triangle, Peeta and Gale, comes from District 12, a proxy for Appalachia. The district is rich only in coal mines, malnutrition, and air pollution, and its people have a certain romanticized quality of hardiness, symbolized by survivalist skills, knowledge of herbal medicine, and, in this novel, the production and sale of bootleg moonshine. The older Haymitch, who’s pulled into the story to be Katniss’ mentor for her Games, was played by Woody Harrelson in the movies as a dissolute alcoholic with an awful middle part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYounger Haymitch is very different. There were rumors last year that Mike Faist, the sweet side of the Challengers love triangle, might play Haymitch in the already announced movie of Sunrise on the Reaping (set for November 2026). Though this casting is not confirmed, and would, if actual, place a thirtysomething into the role of a 16-year-old, there’s something so sunny and practical about Haymitch at the beginning of Sunrise on the Reaping that I started imagining the character as the open-faced, sincere Faist. How does this young, loyal, Faist-ish Haymitch we meet at the start of Sunrise, a guy who lives for his little family of mother, brother, and girlfriend, become the old, bitter, pickled Harrelson Haymitch? This gruesome transformation is the work of the prequel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYoung Haymitch, we learn, is unjustly reaped—he’s only picked to go to the Hunger Games after the first guy who got tapped tries to run away, and the regime police force shoots him in the head in front of the assembled populace of District 12. This event gets edited out of the coverage of the Reaping during the show’s five-minute delay. Many other things get edited out of the presentation of the ensuing Hunger Games competition—a supersized one, with 48 competitors, rather than the usual 24. Things that get cut are moments that reflect unfavorably on the powers that be, but also actions that make Haymitch seem, in retrospect, much more honorable and brave than he appeared based on our knowledge of him from the original trilogy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe discrepancy is a lesson in how media can shape perception, a perennial topic of the Hunger Games books. In reading Sunrise on the Reaping, we see that we, too, fell for the story of Haymitch that the Capitol gave us. This is just one of many ways that enjoying a Hunger Games book feels like an indictment of the reader. Who are we if not citizens of the Capitol, tuning in to the show, priming ourselves for the emotional punch of the next death, feeling moved to send sponsor gifts to children who are stuck in caves and trees, awaiting the moments of their demise with grim but eager anticipation?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuzanne Collins has always seemed to want to prove herself to be a writer who can do more than just exploit a powerful concept—a television show murders a series of kids in public so that a brutal regime can control its people—that Battle Royale got to first. The original Hunger Games trilogy tried to Say Something about authoritarian control and personal resistance, and in telling Haymitch’s story now, Collins seems to have recommitted, with a vengeance, to the idea that these books are teaching their eager readers a lesson. To that end, Collins starts Sunrise on the Reaping with not one, not two, not three, but four epigrams, from George Orwell, William Blake, and David Hume (twice). The story is often interrupted by long stretches of quotations from Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven”—Haymitch’s hometown love, Lenore Dove, is named after this poem. “The Raven” works, Poe famously said in an essay on its composition, because “the death of a beautiful woman is the most poetical topic in the world.” Boy, doesn’t Suzanne Collins know all about that potent combination of beauty and melancholy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Haymitch’s games, the Gamemakers have made the arena into a perfect simulacrum of a beautiful woodland. But this is no bucolic scene from District 12: ”It’s just too attractive to be good,” Haymitch thinks. “The smooth green meadow stretching for miles in either direction. The array of colorful songbirds overhead that match the tufts of cheerful flowers underfoot that match the outfits on the tributes’ backs …” Everything here that’s beautiful can also produce pain. It is, as Maysilee Donner—a fellow District 12 tribute who’s prone to making the salty, shady digs at Capitol residents that provide the much-needed moments of humor in this bleak story—might say, “matchy-matchy,” or far too over-designed to have a soul.\n\nThe death scenes in Sunrise on the Reaping deliver little spikes of surprise and pain. This is a young-adult novel, aimed at readers ages 12 to 18, but the uninitiated—or those who haven’t read one of these books in a while—may find themselves surprised, again and again, at how brutally the deaths that take place inside the Games are written. The second book of the trilogy took place only partly in the arena, and the third book was about war—so it contained plenty of gut-wrenching demises, but not ones engineered for viewing pleasure. Sunrise, like the first book in the original trilogy, forces an innocent point-of-view character to face the Games for the first time, unwinding its layers of awfulness. In returning to this structure, Collins taps back into that sense of surreality and shock to deliver some of the darkest death scenes in the series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe murders of Haymitch’s various allies are something like little Rue’s in the first book, or elderly Mags’ in the second. But the violence is more gruesome, almost Gothic, and the details more heartbreaking—perhaps in service of heaping ever more pain on Haymitch’s shoulders, trauma to fuel his midlife dissipation. Haymitch might leave an ally for a moment, only to return and find a “small white skeleton, stripped clean to the bone” or a fellow tribute holding a friend’s head, “eyes still open, mouth agape.” In a post–Squid Game world, does the realism of the violence work to ground things, or does it just make for better reaction videos? There are some really, really good reaction videos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSunrise on the Reaping certainly connects deeply with contemporary politics—it’s a critique of misinformation, set in a world where those in power designate certain others as less than human and torture their faces to fit a certain “look.” As a Hunger Games prequel, it’s a reminder that successful rebellions like the one Katniss will eventually lead are often preceded by years of stops and starts—that acts of resistance don’t always pay off immediately. If BookTok is any indication, in 2025 people are finding themselves ready for their escapism to include a little bit of David Hume, as a treat. And if this prequel sells as well as its predecessors, expect to see Collins’ imitators line up once again, to volunteer.",

        "content": "At a private baccarat table near the back of the El Cortez Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on a chilly January afternoon, a crowd of fans gathered to watch one of the world’s most famous gamblers at work. Some had come all the way here just to watch him play. They savored every detail—how he cut chips, ruffled his cash, bantered with the dealer. He was dressed for the job. His gray hair was molded into a tight crew cut, and he wore a knitted gold necklace low across his collarbone and a Super Bowl–sized ring with a Ruby 777 jackpot dangling from his hand.\n\nThe scene was impressive, except in one way: This man absolutely sucked at gambling. I’d been with Vegas Matt—the YouTube tycoon whose millions of followers salivate over his every bet—for only a few hours. He’d already lost close to $30,000. His four-figure slot machine deposits had gone bust, an unyielding blackjack jet had hoovered up his teetering stacks of chips, and his rare victories had been reinvested into more audacious, ill-fated propositions. There was no way he’d end the night with dignity, yet here he was, perched at the baccarat table, trying to get even.\n\nUsually, the dealer wordlessly organized Matt’s money into thick columns of $100 bills, pleating their edges at a slight diagonal so she could slash through them all at once with counterfeit-detecting iodine ink. But Vegas Matt was making this bet with a ticket he had just extracted from a slot machine. It was worth $6,627. Baccarat is as close as a gambler can get to flipping a coin: Two pairs of cards are dealt, players add up the numbers printed on them, and the combination that comes closest to nine is declared the winner. The dealer revealed an eight. Vegas Matt turned over a zero.\n\n“Oh my God!” he cried, slinging the cards across the felt while his 30-year-old son, EJ, filmed the disaster on his iPhone. “We cannot win a hand!”\n\nThat, of course, is his schtick. Vegas Matt’s legion of fans follow him for exactly one reason, and that’s to watch him lose—and, on seldom occasions, win—unconscionable amounts of money. That $30,000 wasn’t even close to the worst drubbing he’s taken: In 2023 he and a few friends lost $147,000 on a high-stakes slot machine in about three hours. (The description on the video read, “Nobody should gamble like this, my friends got a little carried away.”) A year later, he managed to blow through about $43,000 in a single afternoon. All told, in 2024 he reportedly suffered $404,000 in gambling losses. Yet, somehow, he has managed to turn losing money into an enviable living—and is one of the only people on Earth to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“People give estimates of what they think we’re making, and it’s always way low,” he told me from the plush interior of his Rolls-Royce, which was still scented with a synthetic new-purchase aroma. “Our watch hours on YouTube [in December] were, like, 5.7 million hours. And there’s a commercial every 10 minutes.”\n\nVegas Matt was on the cusp of a remarkable achievement. In a matter of weeks, his YouTube channel would cross the million-subscriber mark—a metric that pairs nicely with the million or so people who follow his Instagram account, and the 685,000 on his TikTok. New videos appear daily, and they all follow the same format: First, Vegas Matt counts out a hefty wager in front of a blackjack table or a slot machine. Then, like so many gamblers, he simply tries his luck. The camera is framed to provide the illusion that the viewer is in the captain’s chair, preparing to immolate $3,000 on the altar of chance. Throughout all this, Vegas Matt displays no elite strategy, acumen, or gamesmanship. He does not claim to have an insider’s edge or an esoteric jackpot-juicing technique. No one watching his videos is going to pick up tips to improve their approach. But that’s the magic: He’s utterly relatable. One of the enduring axioms of the gambling world is that despite anyone’s best efforts, the house always wins. So, in the language of casinos, to be relatable is to eat shit, constantly, and nevertheless crawl back for more. For amateur gamblers like me, these videos are the closest we can get to the intoxicating precarity of a big bet without risking a dent to the checking account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the fantasy that Vegas Matt is selling: an everlasting bro paradise, sweatless and free, where the bankroll never runs dry and the weekend stretches out into eternity. “It’s like watching a reality show,” he said of his channel’s appeal. “What would happen if you were in Vegas, every day, and gambled? Because that’s what we do every day.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not the only person in my circle to be seduced by this. Mixed in among his army of followers are an old college buddy, a member of my boys-only group chat, and a fellow thirtysomething colleague who was absolutely enthralled after he learned that I was profiling Vegas Matt. (“I love his videos when he’s losing at blackjack,” he said. “Man, awesome.”) When Vegas Matt posted an Instagram clip from the El Cortez in which I could briefly be seen in the background, my brother-in-law instantly shot me a text.\n\n“You doing a piece on Matt?” he wrote. “I’ve got a lot of questions about that guy.”\n\nI did as well. While I’ve thought of him mostly as a gambling cryptid—Bigfoot if he were in way too deep at the roulette wheel—I was also mystified by his persona. His fans are too. Who even is this guy? Where did he come from? How can he stand to lose so much money? But most of all, I wanted to know if his life was as enticing as it looked on camera. When it comes to that, in Vegas, I learned to be careful what I wish for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was always possible to become a celebrity by gambling, but, historically speaking, the luminaries of this world were expected to win. This was especially true in the early 2000s, during the so-called poker boom. Around that time, a renewed interest in the game minted a fresh generation of stars, like Daniel Negreanu, Phil Hellmuth, and Phil Ivey, who had clairvoyant talents on the felt. Negreanu in particular was known for his uniquely telegenic flair—he often announced the exact makeup of the face-down cards in front of the other players, thrilling audiences, bamboozling rivals, and propelling him to $55 million in career live earnings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe poker boom came to an end in 2011, when the Justice Department seized the domains of online gambling sites. (The poker community refers to the day of the raid as “Black Friday.”) In one fell swoop, gambling was dramatically curtailed in America. But seven years later, in 2018, the industry made an unexpected comeback when the Supreme Court overturned the long-standing Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act and liberalized lawful online sports betting in the United States. The practice—once cordoned off to the scant few alcoves on the map where gambling was already legal—is now established in 39 states and counting. Our citizens are hooked: Americans are estimated to have wagered $150 billion on sports in 2024, a seismic increase from the $7 billion risked during the first year of legalization. Real estate moguls, too, are breaking ground on casinos in formerly verboten territories. Officials in New York City are currently mulling 11 proposals from betting companies, including Caesars Palace, which is eyeing an eight-story game room in the heart of Times Square.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, I have watched this disruptive gambling renaissance meld with my social rhythms in real time, as more and more friends embrace the titillation of risk. The Negreanu facade has crumbled. The face of the hobby is no longer a gang of sharks outfoxing one another around the poker table. Now it’s idiots like me, whipping out their phone on a Thursday night, destined to endanger another $20 on a doomed three-leg parlay. My Instagram algorithm is littered, alongside Vegas Matt, with deep-fried, postironic gambling memes, all of which seem to simultaneously celebrate and parody the impotence of this enterprise. One of my favorites features a dejected man with a pickax, millimeters from breaking into a hoard of diamonds. The caption reads: “99% of gambling addicts quit right before their big win … never give up.” Perhaps it makes sense, then, that Vegas Matt has become our avatar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many fools my age, I first discovered Vegas Matt—real name: Matt Morrow—when he appeared on my Instagram during a listless weekday morning while I was trying to stave off a variety of financial anxieties: credit card debt, wedding deposits, a lease-renewal negotiation that was sure to get ugly. Those obligations were briefly alleviated when Matt, looking ridiculously tan, with a wide-eyed, overcaffeinated stare, appeared on my phone and, in about 15 seconds, lost more than what I make in a month. (It was on yet another hand of baccarat.) I was entranced: With the flick of my thumb, I saw him replicate the routine again and again, across hundreds of videos, sloughing off whole down payments—whole net worths—into the maw of the casino. It was obscene, and also, perversely enviable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVegas Matt’s professional gambling career, if you can call it that, began in 2021, when he was 58 and working in real estate. One night, at a video poker table, he needed a miracle to rebound from a $9,000 deficit. He was dealt the ace and queen of hearts and went looking for the other pieces to complete a royal flush. The machine took mercy on him with a jack, king, and 10—all hearts. Morrow was ecstatic. He whipped out his phone and filmed the $12,060 jackpot, beaming with pride. When his son EJ reviewed the clip later that evening, he wondered if it could go viral. They came up with the name Vegas Matt and posted the video to TikTok, where it garnered a modest but promising 40,000 views. The following day, EJ and Matt returned to the scene of the crime to try and film a second royal flush. This time, they bricked out with an ace high. “Absolute shit sandwich,” said Matt in that clip, examining the wreckage of his wager. Tellingly, the video did better, notching 112,000 views. (One of the video’s first comments reads, “You are going to be broke.”)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorrow kept at it. He uploaded video after video of his trips to the casino, fleshing out the character his fans know today. The Vegas Matt persona is a stubborn gambler who cherishes his wins and mourns his losses without ever growing outright despondent. He avoids the tactics of other gambling influencers, who seem to mostly post their massive jackpots. And despite his loss-heavy record, you never quite feel as if you’re watching an addict burn it all down, because it’s clear this enterprise is at least somewhat moneymaking. Morrow didn’t tell me exactly how much money he’s generating from his social media enterprise, but EJ has suggested that 70 percent of their net revenue comes from YouTube advertisements, while the other 30 percent is divided between sponsorships and Vegas Matt’s own merchandise store. (He sells, among other things, a $55 pink hoodie featuring one cursive word: Gamble.)\n\nSo the digital engagement has allowed him to scrub away the incredible risk of a night at the casino, but fundamentally, Vegas Matt can keep the engine churning only if he is making bets. And sometimes the losses do get to him. Morrow told me that he finished 2024 on a nasty losing streak that forced him to take some money that wasn’t reserved for gambling out of his bank account so he could keep making videos. “I was like, I’m sick of this,” he said; he briefly considered paring down his filming schedule from seven to five days a week to stay solvent. But for as much as Vegas Matt does take a beating, he is always safeguarded by a tide of YouTube residuals, which is not something I can assert for anyone else in the process of losing $30,000 at the El Cortez. The man is unshackled by the burden of temperance. He has jury-rigged his arcane revenue streams in such a way that he can continue to do something he truly loves, at an incredible velocity, without ever being humbled. It all makes Morrow vaguely intangible: an immaterial man in a very material world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you’re not among his intended audience, just know that Vegas Matt is famous—much more famous than even I knew. He is famous enough to provoke titters of glee and bewildered, saucer-eyed stares in town. Walk alongside him, and aloof Las Vegas cracks open, revealing a warm and accommodating interior. He can go anywhere, and do anything, with intoxicating panache. No matter where we go, Morrow is recognized by valets, dealers, pit bosses, and, of course, the thousands of tourists ambling around southern Nevada.\n\nIn the palatial Crockfords casino, a pair of Argentinians gesture toward him, pushing against the limits of language to muster a halting “I watch your videos.” A roving band of bros beckon him to their table, hoping for a selfie and a single hand of blackjack. An eager clerk, working the front desk, asks for advice about increasing viewership on his own F1-themed YouTube channel, before passing along a key card to a 63rd-floor suite. But by far, the place Vegas Matt is most famous is the El Cortez, where he films the bulk of his videos and, therefore, where people know they have the best chance of running into him. On the day of my visit, Morrow entered the game room with a Starbucks coffee in hand. Seconds later, he was swarmed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I knew we were going to get lucky!” shouted a fan who had joined this impromptu meet and greet. Vegas Matt is generous, flashing a big smile for everyone in line—after all, it’s really his fans who pay his bills. They all get a sticker as a souvenir. One sticker takes the shape of a blackjack table. Around its perimeter are the words Get Even, or Get Even Worse.\n\nMany of these people came here just to watch Vegas Matt make some bets. For the next four hours, they tail him back and forth across the corridors of the El Cortez, forming jittery semicircles around his seat in the same way one might jostle for a glimpse of Tiger Woods teeing off at Augusta. They wince at his defeats and toast his victories, and all are fluent in the jargon Morrow deploys on his YouTube channel. (Innage refers to how much money one has inserted into a slot machine. Sando is slang for a wager that bricks out in spectacular fashion.) Joe Schachinger and Kathy Wiese, a couple on vacation from Wisconsin, told me that Vegas Matt’s videos have become their go-to after-dinner entertainment, supplanting Jeopardy!, Netflix, and the evening news.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We’ll sit there and watch him for an hour,” said Schachinger, who owns an IT company and plays slots at $30 a spin.\n\n“If he wins, we’ll go to the casino,” Wiese said.\n\n“We live and die with him.”\n\nLurking nearby was Adam Wiesberg, the general manager of the El Cortez, who never lets Vegas Matt out of his sight. He is tasked with giving Morrow and his friends the high-roller treatment. Wiesberg will adjust the music to Vegas Matt’s liking, enforce a tight perimeter around the camera, and, after Morrow has finished his long shift of losing bets, escort him and his posse toward a plush leather booth at the rear of the casino’s marquee restaurant for a complimentary dinner of New York strips and stone crab claws. The one thing Wiesberg doesn’t do, he promised me, is stake Vegas Matt with free chips. Any money the man bleeds comes from his own bank account.\n\nVegas Matt films at the El Cortez because, since 2017, it’s been one of the few casinos in the city that allow patrons to shoot video of their table games. That was a bold decision, especially in such an infamously paranoid business. If players could record the intricacies of casino procedure, would they then be able to scratch out an advantage? Would the house begin to lose? So, early on in the experiment, Wiesberg’s peers in the industry thought he was out of his mind. “We did the first blackjack stream, and my phone was blowing up,” he said. “People were calling me, saying, ‘Hey, there’s someone recording your table!’ ”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Wiesberg is a believer in the power of social media, and more than that, he thinks this association with Vegas Matt has clearly paid off. Looking around, I could understand why. The El Cortez was packed on this languid Friday afternoon, and there was no question that Vegas Matt was the main attraction. Wiesberg has leaned into the partnership to the point that the casino’s gift shop is brimming with Vegas Matt–branded shirts and sweaters. “People come in here to buy my merchandise, and then they lose $5,000,” quipped Morrow, unshy about the revenue he generates for the game room.\n\nMorrow would like to replicate this business model across Las Vegas. He hopes that one of those gleaming casinos on the Strip—away from the low-slung ceilings of the El Cortez—will offer him an exclusive deal. He would gamble there, and in return, he’d swarm the floor with a convoy of his fans.\n\n“I could have this place as busy as the El Cortez, but the geniuses who run these companies don’t get it yet,” Morrow said, from the middle of the alabaster Crockfords game room. “This place will pay Carrie Underwood $2 million a weekend to get 2,300 people into that theater. If I did a meet and greet and they promoted it, I could get 2,300 people there, but instead of a bunch of screaming girls, they’d be gamblers. They should be paying me $2 million.”\n\nIt’s hard to say he’s wrong. Vegas Matt has correctly identified a sea change in the gambling industry. The hobby’s inherent vice has become a feature rather than a bug. It’s never been easier to lose a bet in the United States, and with that, the glittery lures casinos used to rely on to get people inside the building—the Carrie Underwood concerts Morrow is referencing, spectacles that have historically been positioned to conceal the sin of Sin City—aren’t as necessary as they once were. That was another hurdle Wiesberg needed to navigate: Was he OK with someone showcasing the brutality of the El Cortez’s baccarat tables? He told me that other properties around Las Vegas, ones that have historically obfuscated the misery of this business, are not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They’ve been projecting an image to the world forever of excitement and celebration,” he said. “And then he loses, like, $15,000 and walks out.”\n\nWiesberg has put faith in the idea that people like me have become immune to the traditional ways the gambling industry has marketed itself. Gone are the phony assurances of million-dollar payouts. No, maybe the only way I want to gamble—hell, the only way I know how to gamble—is just like Vegas Matt.\n\nHalfway through my day with Morrow, it became clear that he intended to impress me. He unveiled, one by one, all the blessings that were available to him after conquering Las Vegas—as if to emphasize, in no uncertain terms, that none of this was an act. Yes, Vegas Matt really does live like this, and the rest of us are right to be envious. In practice, that meant that I too was wreathed with VIP treatment for as long as I stood beside him. The reason I was in that Rolls-Royce in the first place was so Vegas Matt could show me that 63rd-floor suite near the vertigo-inducing apex of the Crockfords resort. We zoomed into the sky on the express elevator and gazed through floor-to-ceiling windows at the shimmering rooftops of hotels far less regal than ours.\n\nAnd yet, after several hours together, I’m still unable to pierce Vegas Matt’s gaudy persona. None of my questions connect: Morrow isn’t much of a sports fan, even though he wagered $12,500 on the Chiefs to win Super Bowl 59 (another loss). We don’t talk much about music, television, or politics, and the only pop-culture artifact he mentions to me throughout the day is the film Coming to America, which he describes as the “best movie ever.” In fact, the only time Vegas Matt truly opens up to me is when we talk about wealth—the way he pursued it and the luxurious perks it entails.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorrow was raised in the Bay Area and has had a few past lives: He quit a college internship in Hawaii to spend his days at the beach while driving a pedicab. He lived in Los Angeles, where he unsuccessfully tried his hand at stand-up comedy and ended up helping finance a couple of kitschy horror movies in the late 1980s, including the infamous Night of the Demons.\n\nMorrow eventually found his calling in multilevel marketing (or, as he calls it, “network marketing”). He claims to have earned “millions” this way, a feat that would make him the exception to the 99 percent who fail to break even after getting wrapped up in the industry. He got his start in 1989 with a company called FundAmerica, which offered members rebates on airline tickets and long-distance telephone calls. (Its founder was arrested in 1990, and FundAmerica filed for bankruptcy months later.) Morrow told me he then became a top earner at Vemma, a dietary supplement company that was shut down in 2015 following a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission. (The agency alleged that, among other things, Vemma systematically preyed upon college students.)\n\nBefore I could even mount a follow-up question to Morrow about this, he instinctively launched into his defense. It’s as simple as this: MLMs get a bad rap because the wrong people are involved in them. His good name has been tarnished by too many creeps and weirdos. Their failures aren’t just that they can’t motivate others to sign up to sell weight-loss products, Morrow said. The problem is much bigger than that—they don’t have any friends in the first place.\n\n“So many people fail, and they don’t want to take responsibility for their failure. They blame the industry. They say, ‘Oh it’s a scam,’ ” he said. For the first time in our entire day together, there is a flash of venom. “But the reality is, nobody likes you, and you failed because you couldn’t get anyone to join.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo become a gambling influencer, one must already be pretty rich, and that tracks with the single ambition Vegas Matt seems to have. Over and over again, he told me that the only thing he’s ever wanted to do with his life is have fun. So it was a little surprising that he’d adopted such a defensive posture about the method he used to get here. Scroll through the recesses of YouTube, and you’ll see Morrow offering the exact same apologia for the tough-minded virtues of multilevel marketing to the very people he was trying to recruit: In one memorable clip, Vegas Matt lounges in a colossal living room and makes the case that anyone can live like this, so long as they aren’t a loser. “We’re looking for cool people,” he said, advocating for Vemma. “If you’re some unemployed, broke, annoying person, no one is going to listen to you.”\n\nIt’s a sentiment that clarifies the twinge of humiliation I felt after watching him cut out a baccarat bet of roughly the same value as my 401(k). Am I a loser? Are you? Are we, the unwashed masses, simply unlikable—and is that where it all went wrong? Clearly, Vegas Matt is a master at stoking a poisonous sense of inadequacy.\n\nThat’s when one of the great ironies of Morrow’s existence comes into focus. I was attracted to his videos for their effervescent bachelor-party texture, a vision of a life unencumbered by anything but gratification. But the more I was around Morrow, the more I detected an elemental craving just below those gold chains. Toward the end of our time, Morrow told me about the future he envisions for the Vegas Matt brand: He’d like to be flown from casino to casino in a private jet so he may make bets in their businesses as a featured VIP. The fantasy is so ridiculous I can hardly wrap my mind around it: Imagine exploring the country exclusively through the prism of smoke-filled game rooms. The world has rewarded Vegas Matt with incredible spoils, but like so many hustlers before him, he can’t quite stop himself from wanting more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suppose that is one of the few things Vegas Matt and I have in common. Because I too have sat at a blackjack table deep into the witching hour, and even on my best nights, I don’t think I’ve ever wandered to the payout window feeling totally satiated. Yes, Vegas Matt has managed to nullify the perils of gambling, but he has done so by leveraging social media—yet another casino, replete with long odds and enthralling opportunity—where the numbers can always get bigger. The horrible truth is that the iridescent desert sun can be refracting through the tinted windows of your blacked-out Rolls-Royce, and still the only thing on your mind is the next bet.\n\nAnd why is the grind worth it? Easy. It has made Vegas Matt a celebrity, which, as I learned, is much more of a thrill for him than the money is. In a rare moment of vulnerability, Morrow told me he was bullied as a kid and felt like an outcast growing up. “Even at 61 years old, it’s a rewarding experience when people from your past, going back decades, reach out. Everyone wants a piece of you,” he said. “This is cliché, but for someone who had a hard time getting a date to the prom, or who wasn’t picked to be on the basketball team at recess, it’s fun to be like, Hey, maybe I am doing all right.”\n\nHowie Mandel was due onstage in five minutes, but before that, he wanted to take a photo with Vegas Matt. The pair initially connected last summer, when Mandel hosted him on his podcast and probed Morrow about his financial solvency. (“Are you up or down?” asked an inquisitive Mandel at the beginning of the episode.) Morrow, along with the rest of his group, is a special guest of Mandel tonight. We’ve been escorted behind the curtains of the David Copperfield Theater—located in the bowels of the MGM—for a quick flutter of Instagrams. Afterward, Mandel outlines the plan ahead.\n\n“Let’s shoot some content tomorrow,” he said to Morrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoments later, we were sitting in a swank booth in the second row of the auditorium while a trickle of gray-haired snowbirds fill in the cheap seats. I was reminded again of just how easy life in Las Vegas appears to be for Morrow, how this citadel of scams seems to loosen at his touch. I remembered that in a matter of hours, I would no longer be in his orbit. The old world was calling, the one I shared with the other 40 million tourists who come to Las Vegas every year, composed of $10 baccarat bets and gouging ATM premiums.\n\nWe said our goodbyes after the show, and Vegas Matt left me standing in the wide-open chambers of the MGM Grand. My eight hours as a high roller were officially over. Now it was time to become reacquainted with the city as I’ve always understood it.\n\nThe next day, after a couple of way-too-strong gin and sodas, I withdrew the $100 I had, at the beginning of the trip, made peace with losing. The blackjack table treated me well. I was actually on a bit of a hot streak by the time I hit the poker table, where a quintet of players much richer than I bled me dry in record time. Afterward, I found myself in a very familiar place: bereft and alone in a buzzing casino, more drunk than I had planned on being, talking myself out of the wish to get even, or get even worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI held firm and rode the elevator back to my room. I drifted off to sleep while taking solace in the idea that for as glitzy as the Vegas Matt reverie might be, my mundane reality had its own virtue. The thrill of risking money that I can never recover, with YouTube metrics or otherwise, is one of my most cherished sins. And when I do lose, there isn’t a private dinner of stone crab claws waiting to balm my sorrows. I might be playing at much smaller stakes—I’ve never come close to losing $30,000 in a day—but of the two of us, it’s me who really has something to lose. Vegas Matt will never understand the rawness of my vice.\n\nIn turn, maybe I will never understand the drudgery of his craft. A great Vegas trip, for my money, consists of a sudden and violent psychological displacement. All of my frugalities are thrown out the window, bad ideas become good ideas, until, before long, I’m buying a pack of Marlboro Reds at 4 in the morning. Those doses of depravity—meted out in 36-hour intervals—are the spice of life. Vegas Matt, on the other hand, is unable to take a break from reality with the intoxicating assistance of excess. He has mixed business with pleasure, and naturally, business is winning out. There are plenty of things I will always envy about Morrow, but I’m glad that the sacred, brain-healing ritual of a Saturday night at the casino with the boys will never become routine, or even boring. I don’t think I would have understood this if I hadn’t come to see him.\n\nTwo weeks after I left Las Vegas, Vegas Matt crossed the million-subscriber threshold. He celebrated the only way he knows how: risking a million bucks in a single day, and broadcasting the carnage on YouTube. Morrow supplied half of the sum himself with a gratuitous pile of cash secured with rubber bands. The other half was cheerfully loaned out by the casino.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was business as usual for Vegas Matt. A blackjack dealer ripped away his $10,000 wagers, piece by piece. A slot machine repossesses a $20,000 investment in record time. But near the conclusion of the video, Morrow made the single biggest bet he’s ever recorded on camera: $100,000, on one hand of baccarat. This time, though, Vegas Matt was the one to turn over an eight.\n\n“I think I’m going to pass out!” he shouted, dizzy with glee. “Thank you, dealer!”\n\nAll told, Morrow logged a small victory. He was up about $76,000. It could have gone so much worse. At the end of the night, Morrow decompressed in the casino lounge, toasting both his winnings and the viewers who’ve come along for the ride. He’d switched outfits. Morrow was wearing the newest item available in the Vegas Matt merch store. It’s a T-shirt emblazoned with a jackpot counter. The white-and-gold letters across his chest spell out four words: One in a Million.",

Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy girlfriend and I are arguing about what being supportive of one another looks like. It started with her participating in Dry January and me deciding not to. Neither of us drinks that much, I didn’t feel the need to examine my relationship with alcohol or feel the effects of abstaining from it as I have unconsciously gone more than a month without drinking alcohol before. Even though I morally supported her, I did not go out of my way to shield her from alcohol (she is not going through an addiction recovery program after all—she is a 33-year-old challenging herself).\n\nThe whole month she would get upset if I had a glass of wine with dinner or wanted to go to lunch at our favorite brewery, which has a lot of nonalcoholic options and which she typically doesn’t even order alcoholic drinks when we go. Even me choosing brunch at the place with the “best Blood Mary in town” (her words) was seen as me not being supportive.\n\nIt has now evolved into me not supporting her fitness journey because I won’t participate in the things she does or diet. I don’t believe in diets. I was a wrestler in my youth and had a messed up relationship with food. I have since learned to eat and exercise in moderation and to enjoy both things. I support her goals—I encourage her, ask her about how her training is going, or how she’s liking various exercise classes or strength training sessions but I don’t want to join her in them. Apparently, by not wanting to go on a strenuous hike on a Sunday afternoon I’m being unsupportive. I was fine going on an easy to moderate hike but she wants to turn everything into a workout. I picked up Chipotle for us the other day and got her the healthy bowl option that she wanted but I was being “unsupportive” because I got my usual with extra guac and sour cream.\n\nWhen I ask her what supporting her looks like, she says it is me being a part of the things she likes. But what if I don’t want to go to a hot yoga class (why is all yoga heated these days?!), or if I’d rather read a book than go on a walk after dinner every evening? How can I explain to her that being supportive doesn’t actually mean participating?\n\n—I Like My Guac…\n\nDear Guac,\n\nI don’t like the sound of this. It seems to me that your girlfriend is confusing “being supportive” with “adjusting your behaviors to match mine exactly.” That’s a pretty controlling mindset. If she’s unable to tolerate your status as an independent person who is allowed to make lifestyle choices that are different from hers—and if she treats every one of your aberrant choices as a direct affront to hers—then I’m not sure there’s much of a future in this relationship.\n\nTell your girlfriend that if she needs a partner whose lifestyle will match hers exactly, she may have to start looking for a new partner. A healthy relationship often pushes us to change our habits, but the desire has to be mutual, and these expectations still need to take everyone’s preferences and sensitivities into consideration. One person does not get to call all of the shots; in this situation, being accused of being “unsupportive” sounds a lot more like you’re being accused of being “disobedient.”\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy aunt is a doctor. I recently learned that before we were together, my fiancé incessantly messaged her office and wrote negative reviews, all because it didn’t support a therapy that very few doctors support—although apparently specialists to whom my aunt has referred people for other issues do support the therapy in question, which seems to be why my fiancé thought he could get things changed.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy husband has a gay friend from high school. As an adult, before we married, he traveled to see his friend and for a week hung out with him and other gay men. Once, they went sailing where all of them stripped naked and drank beers—I’ve seen the pictures. My husband is very particular about his appearance and grooming. He recently started to lisp. I suspect he’s gay. When I told a (straight) man about this, his response was that no straight man would have done that (sailed naked with gay men). Am I correct that he is probably at least bisexual?\n\n— Am I Naive?\n\nDear Naive,\n\nIt would feel really weird for me to make a guess about the sexual orientation of a stranger (or really, of anyone), but in the interest of providing a thorough answer to your question, I’ll entertain the points you’ve made. And … I think everything you’ve written here can explained away!\n\nParticular about his appearance: So are a lot of straight men. That’s why nobody says “metrosexual” anymore. It’s called self-care. And it keeps you from being the subject of advice letters from a wife who finds you utterly disgusting because you have food in your beard, smell like an old towel, and haven’t clipped your toenails for a year. This is a good thing.\n\nStripping while sailing and drinking beers with gay men: This strikes me as an activity that would be among the very last things someone who was gay and trying to hide it from his wife would do. Perhaps he’s just secure in his orientation and up for a good time?\n\nNew lisp: It’s unusual but not unheard of for an adult to develop one. Ask him to check with a dentist, ENT, or speech therapist if you’re concerned before accusing him of living a lie. (And of course, not all gay or bi men have lisps!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only real red flag about your marriage here is that you are asking a random, probably-homophobic straight man, as well as me, a stranger, to weigh in on your husband’s sexuality. Again, I have absolutely no idea if you’re correct that he is “probably at least bisexual.” Your gut feeling is worth something. What he says about himself, and how you feel when you hear it, is worth more. Can you—I realize this seems wild but stay with me—start a conversation with him? The fact that you seemingly can’t talk to each other and that you believe he would hide a major part of himself from you concerns me much more than his honestly pretty amazing-sounding vacation, the way he speaks, or the fact that he likes to look nice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStop playing detective and sit down for a heart-to-heart with the person you married. If you still don’t believe what he says or trust him to be honest, deal with that rather than asking someone else to judge him against a list of stereotypes.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy sister and I got divorced the same year. Mine was relatively mild compared to hers since we didn’t have kids to quarrel over and force us back together in close quarters. Since then, my sister and I have both tried dating, but I have had far more success. She has been rather bitter about it and constantly complains how she can’t find any good men. The ones she has liked got cold feet once she finally told them about her kids. She dated one guy three weeks before revealing the truth. After the umpteenth conversation, I finally told my sister she was setting herself up for disappointment. She was lying to these men by not being truthful right off the bat. My sister snapped; she didn’t want to lead with any baggage like crazy baby mama drama. I told her she just proved her own point. She ended up kicking me out and currently isn’t talking to me. I know I was rather blunt, but she was like a dog with a bone in our conversations. Is there anything else I could have done? I love my sister but she is driving me nuts.\n\n— But the Baggage\n\nDear Baggage,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou are right about the mistake your sister is making in not disclosing the kids upfront, but you were wrong to tell her. As many times as she ranted about the same thing, she didn’t ask for advice. The next time she complains to you about something for the umpteenth time, instead of “here’s where you’re messing up,” consider “I hate this for you,” and let her figure it out in her own time.\n\nHow to Get Advice From Prudie\n\nSubmit your questions anonymously here. (Questions may be edited for publication.) Join the live chat every Monday at noon (and submit your comments) here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI was married 16 years and divorced six years ago. My ex and I became very amicable and quarantined together during COVID. Since we got along so well during the pandemic, we decided to move in together to help with finances and co-parenting our three kids. I said if we can work it out between us, that would be a bonus. So he sold his house and moved into mine. After a few months, I realized there was no spark, but I loved our relationship of friends/co-parenting. I made this clear to him multiple times when he would ask where the relationship was going. We did couples counseling and the counselor agreed that we were not at a “couples” place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast forward to now, we still live together (separate rooms), and I have moved on and found a new relationship. I never thought I’d even want to, but this snuck up on me and has been absolutely wonderful. My ex is very hurt and feels like I played him. (He has paid no rent or bills the entire Two years he’s been here by the way.) I feel guilty that he thought it would turn into more and it did not, even though I was very clear about that only being a potential bonus of the co-parenting setup. He apparently misunderstood or just thought he’d take the chance it would 100 percent workout. (We have not been intimate since before our divorce.) He is furious with me and says he will never trust me again. Why do I feel so guilty, and how do I let it go and enjoy my new relationship?\n\n— Did I Unintentionally Intentionally Hurt Him?\n\nDear Hurt Him,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I said if we can work it out between us, that would be a bonus.”\n\n“I made this clear to him multiple times when he would ask where the relationship was going.”\n\nIf these statements are true, you covered your bases and did not break his trust. I mean, I don’t think allowing someone who clearly wanted to be in a relationship with you to sell his home and move in was the best idea, but what’s done is done. Please continue with couples counseling with the goals of repairing the damage that was done during this failed experiment and figuring out a new plan for co-parenting—and one for him to move out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI (30, they/them) live in a small city that tends to lean pretty conservative, whereas my household is definitely not. Since moving into a house a few years ago, I had dreams of becoming friends (or at least being friendly, in a way that can build community for sharing resources, helping each other out, etc.) with my new neighbors … but that was quickly dashed when I realized most people directly around me are the types that either really keep to themselves or are full-blown, far-right, racist conspiracy theorists. I basically gave up on trying to go out of my way to connect with anyone around us, but over the past couple of years, I started noticing a few houses around us have yard signs indicating that the people living there are, at the very least, fairly liberal. It made me want to reach out to those people, with the hopes it would turn out better than previous attempts to meet neighbors. Easy enough, right?\n\nThe problem is, I’m not sure how best to do this! Some complicating factors include: I’m agender and use they/them pronouns, which many people struggle with/are put off by, and our household is still taking COVID seriously, so we wouldn’t be up for unmasked meetings or people randomly showing up at our door. My first instinct was to write them a letter (since we obviously would know the address) and introduce ourselves that way and include phone numbers/emails for contact, but I’m not sure what to include or if that would be weird. If I send a letter, what would I say? Should I mention why I chose them to reach out to? Do I include our pronouns? Do I mention we are still adhering to COVID precautions and wouldn’t want people showing up unannounced? And if not a letter, what would be a better option? I’m not sure what is considered “normal” for meeting neighbors, because I grew up almost exclusively in apartments, and that always felt different since we’d mostly just meet people in passing in the hallways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know I’m overthinking this all, but I would love your opinion, thoughts, scripts, or anything else you’ve got!\n\n— To Write or Not to Write\n\nDear To Write,\n\nYou’re not overthinking, but I think you’re possibly over-expecting. You absolutely deserve friendships with people who you like, who like you back, who have good politics, who have good vibes, who know it’s no big deal to use your correct pronouns and respect whatever you need to do avoid getting COVID. But to make it a goal to find these friendships in people who live in specific homes in your neighborhood is to set yourself up for disappointment.\n\nJust imagine it: “Hello I don’t know you but I like your sign and assume it reflects your politics (at least I hope so!) and would like to be friends. My pronouns are they/them and I’m avoiding COVID so I hope you’re not put off but please don’t show up unannounced or expect me to hang out indoors. Looking forward to connecting and getting to know each other — Your neighbor.” This could very well start a beautiful relationship, but it might also feel a bit … intense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should disentangle your desire to meet close, local friends who are compatible with you and share your values from your desire to know your neighbors. When it comes to the people who share your worldview and live nearby, just make it a goal to meet them. Start there. To make a connection, find something that might begin to weed out people who would have a fit over saying “they” or wearing a mask. This is what NextDoor was made for (though please note it can often also be a racist cesspool). How about a post asking for help with an effort that could attract people who tend to be compassionate and progressive? Maybe you could gather a group to support a local political candidate who aligns with your values. Or ask for donations for a shelter for LGBTQ youth, or asylum-seekers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, you know how it goes—see if you end up in a really good conversation with someone who’s dropping off a load of socks and toiletries. Exchange numbers. Arrange a coffee. Or invite a few people over for a cookout. If somewhere along the way they tell you COVID is just a flu or they can’t seem to stop calling you by the wrong pronoun, you can pull back, but you won’t have wasted your time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence Uncensored\n\n“When it comes to finding likeminded people, dropping off letters is not the way to go.”\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris and friends discuss a letter in this week’s Dear Prudence Uncensored—only for Slate Plus members.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m a 24-year-old trans woman living with my fiancé, a 25-year-old non-binary fem. We have been together for almost six years, and we have lived together for about three and a half years after I moved to her country. We had always been incredibly in love, and they supported my transition 100 percent when I started coming out about two years ago. In the last couple of years, we’ve been having some issues (mostly around us having a hard time managing money and my partner’s depression), but we’ve always tried to work on things and work together.\n\nThey confided in me about a year ago (with a tremendous amount of guilt) that they weren’t feeling the same attraction to me as they did before I transitioned. We were still committed to working together to deal with it, and for a while it seemed like it was doing better. However, in the past couple weeks, it’s come up again when talking about getting couples therapy, and we confronted it head-on yesterday. We had a long tearful discussion; they said that, as hard as they were trying, they just didn’t feel the physical connection anymore. We had been trying out polyamory, which was working for me but they really struggled with it, and we just don’t know if this can work out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe’re both utterly heartbroken, and it feels like the world is turning upside down. They feel horrendous and wish more than anything that they could just feel that same attraction, but they can’t (and I don’t think that’s their fault). Is there anything we can do to fix this problem? Or is this a hopeless situation? Either way, they are committed to staying together at least on paper to help me get my permanent residency so I won’t lose everything.\n\n— Absolutely Heartbroken\n\nDear Heartbroken,\n\nThis is really hard. I want to congratulate you and your fiancé on doing your best to work through the tough turn your relationship has taken and to remain supportive of each other during a difficult time. I get a lot of letters from couples in which one person’s attraction to the other has disappeared, and it’s not always handled this well.\n\nI know that doesn’t make it any less painful.\n\n“Hopeless” is harsh, but it seems likely that this relationship is coming to a natural end because of changed feelings, which is just how relationships go sometimes. After all, the two of you have left no stone unturned here. Couples therapy. An exploration of polyamory. Long and tearful discussions. Those are all the things I’d recommend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy only other suggestion is: Time. Take some—it sounds like you have to anyway due to the residency issue—before making a final decision. I noticed that you said your partner has been feeling less attracted to you since your transition but that the change also lines up with a period of time when they’ve been dealing with depression. I wonder if they are willing to hang in there a little longer to work on treating that, to see if their attraction reignites or if they feel more hopeful about exploring tweaks to your relationship when they’re in a better place. It’s worth asking, but you should also mentally prepare yourself to have to break up—hopefully amicably, because you seem to have a lot of love and respect for each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGive Prudie a Hand in “We’re Prudence”\n\nSometimes even Prudence needs a little help. This week’s tricky situation is below. Join the conversation about it on Twitter with Jenée @jdesmondharris, and then look back for the final answer here on Friday.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am a high school sophomore struggling with a friend’s sort-of-homophobia. “Ella” is straight, and I am a closeted lesbian. We became close fairly quickly at the beginning of our freshman year, but when she repeatedly asked me if I was straight, we had known each other for less than a month. It’s obvious she was trying to be “inclusive,” but all she succeeded in doing was freaking me out. I didn’t know if she was trustworthy, so I ended up lying, which I don’t regret but still feel horrible about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf it was just that, I would try to let it go. The thing is, it’s not just that. Every so often, Ella will say something mildly icky about gay people. I try to push back, sometimes gently and sometimes not-so-gently. However, she always brushes me off, downplays the impact of her words, or condescendingly claims to “know” that [insert stereotype] is actually reality. Then I always end up agreeing to disagree, because going back and forth is exhausting. The constant balancing act of standing up for what’s right while making sure Ella doesn’t get suspicious is frustrating and upsetting. Ella is also incredibly boy-crazy, which means she expects me to be up for discussing both her and my crushes constantly. Thankfully, it’s gotten better since we met, especially since I started to pretend that I’m a “late bloomer” who’s just more interested in schoolwork.\n\nI hate all of this, though! I hate lying, and changing the subject, and agreeing to disagree, and feeling conflicted about a person I otherwise like and enjoy. I hate that she pretends to be tolerant when she’s one of the most narrow-minded people I’ve ever met. My only other queer friend goes to a very accepting school and has loads of accepting friends, so I have nobody in my life who understands what I’m going through. Lately, I have tried to put some distance between Ella and me, but we’re part of the same friend group at school, so I’m sort of stuck with her. What can I do? Please help!\n\n— Losing-It Lesbian\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI come in here looking for … advice? Vindication? Something in between. I broke up with my partner recently, and one of the reasons was our different outlook on what a quiet moment should sound like. They thought that unless we were actively engaged in activities (such as reading) a shared moment would necessarily include conversation. I, on the other hand, am fine with being quiet and existing in my head for a while next to someone. If there is nothing specific to talk about, is it weird that I would like quiet from time to time? To look around a place in silence? He said it was weird and shared moments include conversation, but Prudie, sometimes there is nothing to talk about, and I have no desire to talk about articles or whatever he is seeing on Twitter. Do people really just talk? That much? Sounds exhausting.\n\n— Would Like a Moment of Quiet Please\n\nDear Quiet Please,\n\nSo the two of you would just be sitting in a room together, not reading, not doing anything special, and you would not want him to talk? At all? Honestly, yes, that does strike me as weird—meaning, unusual. But that doesn’t mean it’s not valid and okay! You were right to break up with someone who was incompatible with you, and I believe there is someone else out there who will be happy hang out with you in silence (and maybe text you when he sees a good tweet—just make you sure turn your notifications off so you’re not bothered, okay?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nOver lunch the other day my brother mentioned that he had taken his 2-year-old son to buy a helmet so he can ride his tricycle outside, and that my nephew’s first choice was a yellow and pink helmet covered with cartoon flowers. My brother gently steered him toward a more “manly” helmet. This provoked a lively (amiable) discussion around the table as to whether little boys should be allowed to wear pink and flowers if they so choose. My immediate response was that they should, but I suppose I can see my brother’s point that allowing kids to wear anything they please might get them bullied. What’s your position?",

        "content": "We know how pop-star feuds catch fire—a nasty breakup, an onstage embarrassment, some sibling rivalry, or … um, that thing where someone steals your backup dancers. But how does a beef end?\n\nAs a practical matter, if the feud doesn’t wind up in a courtroom, it can often end anticlimactically, in some publicist’s or manager’s office. But as a cultural matter, when the feud involves chart-topping musicians, the charts eventually deliver a verdict. In the early ’70s, after the Beatles split, nothing got John Lennon to eventually stop slinging haterade at Paul McCartney in his interviews and song lyrics except the humbling realization that Paul’s solo songs were charting better than John’s. (By the mid-’70s, they buried the hatchet.) Something similar happened in the mid-’10s after Taylor Swift picked a fight with Katy Perry, then proceeded to usurp her pop queendom. (They, too, eventually made up.) In its way, this dawning Billboard-based realization—generated by the day-to-day choices of ordinary music listeners—is quiet but decisive.\n\nThis is the way the feud ends: not with a banger, but with a weeper.\n\nJust such a verdict is being rendered, quietly but decisively, on the charts right now in the ongoing matter of Drake versus Kendrick Lamar, a bruising feud that launched nearly a year ago and shows few signs of dissipating. (Not since Taylor Swift versus Kanye West has a vendetta between a pair of music stars dragged on so long, with such a long tail of chart consequences.) In the media, this beef is still sizzling, loudly. As you may have heard, earlier this year Drake filed a dubious lawsuit seeking damages from Universal Music—the recording conglomerate for which both he and Lamar record—for releasing and promoting Kendrick’s now-legendary, chart-topping, pedophilia-alleging, Grammy-winning, Super Bowl–igniting diss record “Not Like Us.” Right through this week, there are new headlines: Universal responded to the lawsuit, undermining its legal basis and basically dunking on Drake by calling his suit “an attempt to save face.” (The pièce de résistance: Universal’s lawyers found a 2022 petition Drake signed decrying the use of rap lyrics in courtroom prosecutions and declaring hip-hop bars are artistic expression, not to be taken literally. Nice touch.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery turn in the K-dot versus Drizzy saga has been like this: loud, flashy and popcorn-worthy. When “Not Like Us” dropped about 10 months ago—the umpteenth turn in a series of withering singles—folks declared Lamar the winner of the beef by general acclaim. Drake’s lawsuit, however futile it may turn out to be, has been equally headline-grabbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the real sign Kendrick has triumphed has been mellowing out atop the Hot 100 the past four weeks, a gentle duet between Lamar and R&B singer SZA, built on a sample of a beloved soul vocalist who died nearly two decades ago. It’s a very pleasant, chilled-out track that has the kind of omnipresence a Drake ballad would have had a few years ago. If you’ll allow me to mangle T.S. Eliot, this is the way the feud ends: not with a banger, but with a weeper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe song is called “Luther,” and it’s named after Luther Vandross, the florid vocal legend who reigned on the R&B charts in the 1980s and ’90s before his untimely passing in 2005. Taken from Lamar’s late-2024 album GNX, “Luther” embeds three layers of classic male-female balladry into one hit: Already a duet between our reigning top rapper and top hip-hop–soul singer, the track is built around a generous sample of “If This World Were Mine,” a cherished 1982 R&B hit by Vandross and Cheryl Lynn, that is itself a cover of a 1967 Motown deep cut by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. Neither the Gaye–Terrell original nor the Vandross–Lynn remake was a big pop hit—on the Hot 100, the former topped out at No. 68 in 1968, and the latter “bubbled under” at No. 101 in 1982. But on the R&B chart, Gaye–Terrell’s “Mine” reached No. 27 and Vandross–Lynn’s “Mine” reached No. 4—the latter essentially an ’80s Black-radio staple. In other words, by picking this song to sample, focusing on Vandross’ version, and invoking him in the song’s title (a gambit first pulled by Jay Z and Kanye West on their 2011 single “Otis,” which prominently sampled Otis Redding), Lamar and SZA sent a signal to the Black community that this track was one for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet “Luther” has become one for everybody. It’s now Kendrick Lamar’s longest-running Hot 100 chart-topper, with four straight weeks at No. 1. And it’s not just being consumed by Lamar’s most loyal rap fans. In addition to being the most-streamed song in America for the past month, according to Billboard, it’s now the second-most-played song on radio. Even if you limit the data to Top 40 pop stations, “Luther” currently ranks a remarkable eighth, just below the latest hits by Chappell Roan and Billie Eilish. It’s Lamar’s first hit as the lead artist to make the top 10 on pop radio; previously, he only did that well on pop stations in a supporting role on tracks by pop megastars Maroon 5, Taylor Swift, and the Weeknd.\n\nBack on the Hot 100, the track’s four-week run at No. 1 is also remarkable, because that beats all of Lamar’s previous chart-toppers: Taylor Swift’s Kendrick-supported “Bad Blood” (one week, 2015), his own “Humble” (one week, 2017) and “Squabble Up” (one week, 2024), the Drake-beef-inflaming Future–Metro Boomin collaboration “Like That” (three weeks, 2024), and—this is the surprise—“Not Like Us.” The smash Drake diss amassed three weeks total on top, in a very unusual chart pattern. It commanded the Hot 100 for one week last May, when it first dropped at the height of the Drake beef; a second week in July, fueled by the release of its acclaimed music video; and a third week in mid-February, right after Kendrick’s meme-worthy Super Bowl halftime performance. That’s the thing about Lamar’s victorious diss—notoriety is its gasoline. The song is known the world over, but more as a source of LOLz, as a dance challenge, and as a jokey singalong (“A-minorrrrrrrr”) than a song to be enjoyed passively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe haven’t seen an artist this dominant with this many hits since Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour peak.\n\n“Luther,” by contrast, is Kendrick Lamar’s first chart-commanding pop hit that’s more about vibes than bars. It’s the kind of song that works best if you let it waft in the background. Riding a bass-heavy thump over orchestral strings, “Luther” finds Lamar singing more than he raps—he is an adequate, not virtuosic singer—with dreamy, devotional lyrics that in spots feel like first drafts. The opening verse climaxes with: “If this world was mine, I’d take your enemies in front of God/ Introduce ’em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire/ Fah-fah, fah-fah-fah, fah-fah, fah.” Not since the Christmas carol “Deck the Halls” has “fah” borne so much weight.\n\nThe song’s best melodic hooks are carried by Ms. Solána Imani Rowe. This is not the first time SZA and Lamar have collaborated—she was his vocal partner on the hit Black Panther soundtrack anthem “All the Stars” (No. 7, 2018)—but she has only become a bigger deal since then. Especially after her 2022 sophomore LP SOS became a record-breaking chart juggernaut, SZA has emerged as zillennials’ undisputed Queen of R&B. On “Luther,” SZA’s verses are a showcase for her signature trill—you know it’s her when she quavers on the “oh” sounds in the pre-chorus: “In this world, concrete flowers growww/ Heartache, she only doin’ what she knowww/ Weekends, get it poppin’ on the lowww.” And on the main refrain, Lamar provides mellow counterpoint vocals but mostly hangs back and lets SZA carry the melody: “If it was up to me/ I wouldn’t give these nobodies no sympathy/ I’d take away the pain, I’d give you everything.” Three decades after Method Man and Mary J. Blige’s smash, street-bumping 1995 duet remake of “You’re All I Need to Get By” (itself a Marvin Gaye–Tammi Terrell cover), “Luther” is—though both Lamar and SZA are millennials—what a hip-hop ballad duet sounds like in the Gen Z era: more moody, impressionistic … a pillowy sigh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, both commercially and artistically, “Luther” in 2025 is for Lamar—I hope he won’t be insulted when I say this—what 2018’s “In My Feelings” was for Drake. In both cases, the track started out as a deep cut before emerging as a fan favorite. As I chronicled seven years ago in this Slate No. 1 hits series, when Drake dropped his 2018 album Scorpion, “Feelings” was not a promotional focus; it debuted within the Top 10 among a bunch of other album cuts. But after a social media–fueled dance challenge, the moody, midtempo, romantically wistful “Feelings” rose to No. 1 and wound up one of Scorpion’s biggest hits, a 10-week Hot 100 commander and the year’s Song of the Summer. Similarly, when Lamar surprise-dropped his GNX album in November, “Luther” was not tapped as a single (that status went to the more up-tempo No. 1 hit “Squabble Up”). It wasn’t even necessarily a standout, although when tracks from the new Kendrick album swept the Hot 100’s Top Five in early December—a remarkable chart achievement that only the Beatles, Swift, and Drake had ever pulled off before—“Luther” debuted at a robust No. 3, likely fueled by SZA’s prominent featured role. After the holiday season, when Lamar’s roster of tracks enjoyed another round of attention fueled by the Grammys and the Super Bowl, “Not Like Us” made its latest comeback, but “Luther” was right behind it. Social media helped—“Luther” is fairly popular on TikTok, although “Not Like Us” has been even more viral on the social-video site—but more importantly, Lamar and SZA performed the song live as part of Kendrick’s Super Bowl halftime medley. That much-dissected extravaganza wound up being the most-watched Super Bowl halftime in history, which certainly didn’t hurt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the halftime show could have just provided a boost to the ever-present “Not Like Us.” The rise of “Luther” to No. 1, several weeks after the Super Bowl, was less predictable. The song seems to be the biggest beneficiary of Kendrick’s current cultural dominance—a vibey bop audiences have organically gravitated toward in their mood-based Spotify playlists and radio requests. Moreover, Lamar and SZA still haven’t produced an official “Luther” music video, which means the song could conceivably get another chart boost in the weeks to come, should a glossy visual ever arrive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, maybe the most remarkable Kendrick chart stat of 2025—the one that best exemplifies the rarefied air he’s now breathing—is that he has had three of the Top Five songs on the Hot 100 for more than a month. Ever since mid-February’s double whammy of the Grammys (where “Not Like Us” was the surprise winner of both Record and Song of the Year) and the Super Bowl, Lamar’s hits “Luther,” “Not Like Us,” and “TV Off” have each occupied a spot in the Top Five, crowding out everything but the former No. 1s “Die with a Smile” by Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga and the deathless “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” by Shaboozey. (For two of Kendrick’s post–Super Bowl weeks, he held down an incredible four of the Top Five—the above three singles plus a resurgent “Squabble Up.”) These songs are all receiving some measure of streams, download sales, and even radio airplay. R&B/hip-hop stations in particular have practically become all-Kendrick radio, as “Luther” and “TV Off” are both among the format’s three most-played songs. And “Squabble Up” and “Not Like Us” are still receiving pop-radio airplay months after they peaked. We haven’t seen an artist this dominant with this many hits since Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour peak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, to make a more apt comparison, since Drake: Lamar has not only defeated him in their rap beef, he has now, commercially, become Drake, our default imperial rapper. Many times over the past decade or so, Drake has monopolized multiple positions in the Top 10: most especially in his peak year of 2018, when “God’s Plan,” “Nice for What,” and “In My Feelings” all rode the chart’s upper reaches for months, but also even more recently than that. (Here’s a week in 2021 where he owned nine of the Top 10, for example.) This omnipresence has now transferred to Lamar. Moreover, this has remained true even as Drake has tried to steal back his spotlight: In February, Drake dropped a new album, a team-up with Canadian singer PartyNextDoor, and while it had a decent first week, a month later, none of its hits are charting as well as any of these older Lamar tracks.\n\nThe afterglow of Kendrick’s culture-commanding winter should have faded by now, but it looks like he will remain ubiquitous into the spring. And again, this is nearly a full year after the start of the whole Drake beef, which has fundamentally altered our perception of Lamar. America didn’t just root for him in the competition with Drizzy. It turned him into our pop mascot. That’s new for Kendrick—even during the peak of his critical acclaim in the mid-’10s, with To Pimp a Butterfly and the Pulitzer-winning Damn, Lamar didn’t read as an all-purpose pop star. Even last year, when “Not Like Us” first arrived, Kendrick was still the rapper’s rapper.\n\nNow, with “Luther,” he’s the crooning rapper we turn up on the car radio during our commute.\n\nIn other words, Kendrick Lamar is rewriting the rules for imperial phases as we speak. I recently studied that subject on an episode of my Slate chart-history podcast Hit Parade, in which I defined what an artist’s imperial phase means and went deep on Madonna’s now-legendary one in the ’80s. In a bonus conversation for Slate Plus, I interviewed pop critic DJ Louie XIV, host of his own podcast Pop Pantheon, and he made an interesting and mostly correct observation: Imperial phases are normally enjoyed only by the young. “Pop music is one of the most fickle, ever-changing things,” Louie said. “I mean, have we seen a pop star have an imperial phase past the age of, I don’t know, 32?!” I agreed, but in a subsequent chat, Louie and I realized one major counterexample we could have cited: Kendrick Lamar, right now, at age 37. Lamar fans may not rank “Luther” very highly in his pantheon of songs, and, much the way few Madonna fans recall that her longest-running No. 1 hit was the mid-’90s ballad “Take a Bow” (more weeks on top than “Like a Virgin” or “Like a Prayer”!), I suspect years from now only the most dedicated Lamar fans will remember that “Luther” was his longest-running No. 1. But no matter what, it will remain a monument to this quirky moment when Kendrick was as effortlessly commanding as any Main Pop Girl, when it wasn’t a question if this world was his.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy friend Susie prides herself on rejecting conventional norms and challenging the status quo at every turn. I respected her independence, her boldness, and her desire to carve out her own path in the world. But when she made the decision a few months before giving birth not to vaccinate her baby and to forgo circumcision, I found myself struggling. These are choices that, in my own belief system, seemed reckless. I voiced my concerns, gently at first, hoping for a thoughtful discussion. But what I didn’t expect was to be labeled a “narrow-minded,” “brainwashed” fool. Susie lost it and began shouting at me in the middle of a coffee shop. My heart sank as the conversation turned toxic. She saw no middle ground, no room for nuance.\n\nI figured that time would cool the tension between us. But Susie’s next move shattered that hope. Hours later, I received a text. It was short, direct, and unapologetically cruel: She was cutting me out. I wasn’t welcome at her baby shower. She made it clear she no longer wanted my “energy” near her, that my concerns had shown her who I truly was, and she wanted no part of that. But that wasn’t the end. Through a mutual friend, I learned that Susie had begun to craft a narrative about me, one that portrayed me as a manipulative force, pressuring her to conform to societal expectations.\n\nA few months later, I found out the name of Susie’s baby, which is a vegetable: think “Kale,” only even sillier.\n\nIn her long, drawn out social media post announcing the name, she claimed the name to be a symbol of rejecting societal norms, of embracing a natural lifestyle and standing up against traditionalism. Reading between the lines of the social media post, it seemed to me like she was using the announcement of her baby’s name as yet another opportunity to publicly bash me.\n\nSusie has turned our disagreement into something so much bigger than it ever needed to be. I want to believe there is a way back from this, that we can have a conversation, lay down our weapons, and rebuild. But the reality is, Susie has made it clear she’s no longer interested in reconciliation. Should I keep trying? Should I continue to fight for a friendship that has become so distorted by her own narrative?\n\n—Uninvited (an Unfortunate Slight)\n\nDear Uninvited,\n\nYou said it yourself: Susie has made it clear that she’s not interested in reconciliation, or conversation of any kind. If that’s the case, then there’s no way you can figure out how to “fix” the situation on your own—reconciliation is a two-way street.\n\nI would advise you to accept the reality of having to put this friendship on ice for now. Maybe she’ll come back around—life is long! Motherhood is lonely!—but even when that happens, I’d personally have deep reservations about making up with anyone who’s able to cut you off that easily. Your differences in beliefs are real, but a real friend wouldn’t go nuclear like that.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

Dear Prudence, * Your letter signoff Your pronouns Your email (optional and confidential—please include if you're open to Dear Prudence following up) Submit\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m very conflict-averse. Growing up, my mom often became emotionally volatile if she was disagreed with or corrected, even over something mundane and wrong, like saying the currency conversion rate between USD and EURO is in the thousands. I moved out of the house a few years ago and have been reinforcing boundaries with her because of her emotional abuse and volatility.\n\nMy problem is that I still find myself staying silent when I disagree with my friends and colleagues. I know that it will be a process before I can feel fully comfortable vocalizing my feelings, but I would love some examples of things I can say in disagreements. A good example is that recently, my coworker was talking about friend drama, and she said some revealing and unkind things about her friends. It made me very uncomfortable on their behalf, but I was like a deer in headlights! I worry about my disagreement or disapproval being taken poorly, but I desperately want to be more vocal and honest with the people around me.\n\n—Squirming Silently\n\nDear Squirming,\n\nI think you’re confusing three things there: voicing disagreement vs. voicing disapproval vs. voicing discomfort. Voicing disagreement over facts or issues (i.e. if you don’t agree with someone’s politics or the correct way to bake a cake) is something you can certainly practice on all kinds of people. I find that a “I respect your opinion, but I don’t really see it that way” or “I don’t think we’re on the same page about this!” delivered with a calm, neutral tone is particularly effective.\n\nVoicing disapproval over someone’s actions or choices, however, is another thing entirely. (i.e. “I think you need to break up with him,” or “I don’t like how drunk you got last night”). I would be very choosy about how you do this with; casting judgment like that is really only something that very close friends, who have a lot of trust between them, should do, because otherwise, it will always come across as judgy and unsolicited.\n\nIt sounds like voicing discomfort, on the other hand, is what you actually want some practice with. This is also an area where I think you should be choosey about where you spend your time and energy; telling an over-sharey coworker that you’re not comfortable hearing them shit-talk their friends may honestly not be as good of a use of your time as simply changing the subject or making an excuse to leave. (I’m a big fan of gazing off into the distance and saying, “I think I need to say hi to someone” and leaving.) I would save direct confrontation (“This is making me feel weird,” or “I’m not sure I can talk about this with you”) for people you have established connections with, whom can be trusted to treat your feelings and your discomfort seriously. Does that all make sense? I support the fact that you’re hoping to stand up more for yourself and your needs, but I just don’t want you to confuse these three things. Being able to tolerate and even create healthy conflict takes a lifetime’s worth of practice, but half the battle is deciding whether a person is even worth the effort in the first place.\n\nGet Even More Advice From the Dear Prudence Podcast\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy husband “Kyle” is having a conflict with his family that doesn’t really involve me, but I do want to support him and be able to give good guidance when he asks for it. Our family dynamics are totally different, so can you give me some insight?\n\nWe learned late last year that his brother “Tim” and their mom “Nora,” inexplicably voted for Trump, which goes against all of their/our family values. Tim is disabled due to mental health issues, while his wife works in a research lab, and Nora makes minimum wage and relies on public assistance for help with healthcare, rent, and food. Not to mention my husband’s sister has a gender nonconforming kid who will likely identify as queer of some kind one day.\n\nKyle was very upset to hear from them (post-election) that they voted the way they did, largely motivated by racism and immigration suspicion, according to them. He was angry with them, but didn’t call names and didn’t “cut them off”; he simply said he wasn’t ready to talk and didn’t know how to deal with it. Tim and Nora took it very personally—Tim sent us an absolutely vile group text accusing us of hating his child and being intolerant of anyone different than us, living in an echo chamber, etc. I’m not sure how his child got brought into it, but my best guess is that he made the leap that rejection of him is by default rejection of his son as well? Maybe being mad on behalf of his son was easier? Anyway, he claimed that “maybe” one day we would be able to have supervised visitation with our nephew, but that there was no apology we could ever offer him that would be good enough. And then he and Nora both blocked us on all channels.\n\nI’m baffled by this behavior. Tim has long struggled with his mental health, and such an extreme reaction is very troubling. I promise there is no hidden transgression here—Kyle really was just like “Wow I’m really upset about this and I’m not ready to talk it out yet.” In the last few weeks after this, we’ve just decided to take them at their word and not contact them. But do we just keep doing that forever? My idea was to take one more shot and try to write a letter or an email trying to make peace—but we keep circling around about what we would even try to express or ask for in return from them.\n\n—No Contact I Guess?\n\nDear No Contact,\n\nIt sounds to me that Kyle set a boundary with his family, and Tim and Nora went nuclear. There aren’t any magic words to say to someone who chooses that option in a relationship—it’s a lot like walking out on a fight, or ghosting. That kind of behavior, especially when it comes from a loved one, can be very destabilizing. To try to further engage Tim and Nora on this issue would essentially be a tacit endorsement of their behavior—i.e., that it’s okay to go nuclear. It’s not. Give them all the time and space they need to cool off. There’s no room for negotiation or reconciliation here if one side has gotten up from the table.\n\n—Delia\n\nCatch up on this week’s Prudie.",

        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nMany Americans may not have taken notice, but yesterday marked yet another turning point for this Trump administration: A major U.S. law firm waved the white flag to our authoritarian president.\n\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, based in New York, has a lengthy list of powerful clients and a long-standing commitment to causes of public interest. On March 14, it was singled out by Trump when he issued an executive order accusing the law firm of “undermining the judicial process” and participating “in the destruction of bedrock American principles.”\n\nHe did so because the firm’s definition of the public interest leaned in a liberal direction, and because it employs Mark Pomerantz, who worked with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in the New York hush money trial, for which the president was convicted of committing 34 felonies.\n\nThe president channeled his grievances against Paul Weiss and other so-called global law firms by alleging that they “have engaged in activities that make our communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections.” The order also claims: “They have sometimes done so on behalf of clients, pro bono, or ostensibly ‘for the public good’—potentially depriving those who cannot otherwise afford the benefit of top legal talent the access to justice deserved by all.”\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the order also singled out Pomerantz, calling him “unethical” and pointing out, in unusually personal terms, that he “left Paul Weiss to join the Manhattan District Attorney’s office solely to manufacture a prosecution against me.”\n\nAmong other things, the president directed his subordinates “to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Paul Weiss and Mark Pomerantz” and “take appropriate steps to terminate any contract … for which Paul Weiss has been hired to perform any service.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe choice the firm faced reminded me of a classic 1950s television commercial. It shows a woman slowly turning to the camera, revealing a black eye and professing her loyalty to her brand of cigarettes by saying, “Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Paul Weiss’ case, though, it took just six days for it to switch rather than fight, abandoning its principles and those of the legal profession. This is a surprising development, given the firm’s history.\n\nAs the New York Times explains, “The firm has long prided itself on breaking barriers and standing up to the government on issues like civil rights. Its website trumpets how it was the first major New York City firm to have Jewish lawyers working alongside Gentiles, to hire a Black associate and to have a female partner.” Moreover, the legal profession has long been considered an advocate of what former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once called “the attainment of liberty through law.”\n\nApparently, Paul Weiss did not get that message. What the firm did yesterday is a reminder of the Vietnam-era adage that justified American wartime abuses: “We have to burn this village to save it.”\n\nBrad Karp, the head of the firm, went, hat in hand, to the Oval Office and lit a match to the firm’s reputation. To get the president to back off his threats to the firm, Karp agreed “to a series of commitments, including to represent clients no matter their political affiliation and contribute $40 million in legal services to causes Mr. Trump has championed, including ‘the President’s Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, and other mutually agreed projects.’ ”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould any self-respecting lawyer and law firm let anyone, including the president of the United States, tell them whom they should represent or give into the kind of blackmail that has become a regular practice since Trump returned to office? I would have assumed that Karp and Paul Weiss would have rejected such overtures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is some dispute over the exact terms of the agreement; HuffPost reported discrepancies between the version of the document the White House posted and what Karp sent to his firm. For example, the White House version asserts that the firm had agreed Pomerantz was indeed guilty of “wrongdoing,” though the particular kind of wrongdoing was left unspecified. The only wrong that Pomerantz did was to do his job in a way that offended the president, and Karp’s note failed to mention him.\n\nBut the damage has already been done. That is why, even as it described the differences in the versions of events offered by Karp and the White House, HuffPost still referred to what it called a “shocking agreement” between them.\n\nRelated From Slate What Does Trump Have to Gain by Pissing Off John Roberts? The Answer Is Concerning. Read More\n\nIn light of that agreement, one can only imagine the hallway conversations between lawyers at Paul Weiss right now. The firm’s capitulation is a blow to the forces seeking to resist the destruction of America’s constitutional order. When the history of this era is written, the proverb that fish “rot from the head” may have particular purchase in explaining the significance of Paul Weiss’ actions. The firm’s surrender also signifies another kind of rot, namely what Yale Law professor Jack Balkin calls “constitutional rot,” which he defines as “a degradation of constitutional norms that may operate over a long period of time.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen constitutional rot becomes advanced, Balkin notes, “people turn to demagogues, … who stoke division, anger and resentment. Demagogues promise that they will restore lost glories and make everything right again.” These demagogues proceed by cowing their opponents and encouraging everyone, especially the most powerful loci of resistance, to fall in line. And falling in line is exactly what Paul Weiss did.\n\nGoing after large law firms is the Trump administration’s way of showing that no one is safe. Making one of them say uncle and going public about it demonstrates that proposition.\n\nStanding up to bullies is the best way to deal with the administration. By backing down, Paul Weiss feeds the beast and encourages more of the kind of bullying that the White House has used against it.\n\nThe first domino has fallen. Sadly, others will soon follow.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Dear Prudence is online weekly to chat live with readers. Here’s an edited transcript of this week’s chat.\n\nQ. Big Mother: My mother recently installed an indoor smart camera at our family cabin “for security,” and insists it is left on even when we’re there (i.e. just my husband and I or with my other siblings and their partners, friends, what have you). We all feel very uncomfortable with this, as none of us trust her not to spy on us or use it against us. She insists she’ll never look at it when we’re there and that we’re never to unplug it just in case, but just recently we were up and put a box over it (it has a 360-degree swivel so it’s not as simple as blocking it) and she lost it on us, and said I know who covered it, all but proving our fears that she is using it to spy on us… This feels so invasive and inappropriate, and borderline illegal. It has always been a family cottage that we’ve all shared but now we feel so uncomfortable. Help!\n\nA: If you’re a co-owner of the cabin, stand firm, continue to cover the camera, and let her lose it on you if she wants. If “family cottage that we’ve all shared” translates to “cottage that my parents own and let me use for free,” I’m afraid you’ll have to play by your mom’s rules or head on over to Airbnb.\n\nQ. Sick Breakup: Am I a horrible person for wanting to break up with my boyfriend now that he has a long COVID? My boyfriend and I have been dating for about six months and he got COVID about a month ago. Before that, he was always more into the relationship than I was. I realized shortly before he contracted COVID that there were some big choices he made in his life that I wouldn’t want in a long-term partner. After that point, I was fine with us being in a not-so-serious relationship until one of us wanted out, but I figured he probably wouldn’t want that. I was going to talk to him about this, but then he got COVID. He’s been struggling so much and I feel terrible for him. He hasn’t been up for much fun stuff and he has been leaning on me for help a lot more than before. He has friends he could ask but he keeps saying, “This is stuff a girlfriend is supposed to do.” If I didn’t have such a good support system, I think I’d be miserable. I just want out but that seems like I’d be kicking him when he’s down. To top it all off, he’s good friends with a good friend of mine, so I know this might cause a rift in that friend group. Is there any way I can break up with him without seeming like a horrible person?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: “Before that, he was always more into the relationship than I was” is all I needed to hear. You’re not breaking up with him because he has a long COVID, you’re breaking up with him because you were never that crazy about him. Not to mention, he’s placing weird gender-based demands on you and seems like a little bit of a jerk. People end relationships all the time. Get out ASAP and I promise you, the friend group will get over it.\n\nQ. The Silver Fox: I am dating a man who is 78 years old. He is cheerful, active, and really seems to get me. My mother is against me seeing him, saying he only sees me as a “trophy girlfriend” and an ego-booster. Prudence, I am 34, and I don’t feel that is too large of an age gap. What should I do?\n\nA: If you like it, I love it. Your mother may be totally right about how he feels, but you are completely grown up and get to make your own choices, and you’re happy. Remind her of that.\n\nQ. Domestically Challenged: I’m a 26-year-old person (they/them) with ADD. I struggle a lot with executive functioning; messy rooms, laundry piling up, dishes sitting out… (Due to my physical and mental health, I currently live at home.) I don’t like being messy, but no matter how hard I try I can’t get past that barrier. I have found over the years that I function best when I live with someone else; when I’ve lived alone for school the mess has been even worse, there’s been no structure to my days, and I’ve often ended up skipping meals (or filling up on snacks), whereas in a shared space I feel responsible for cooking a real meal for everyone and keeping to a schedule, and I feel bad if I let stuff pile up too much. Part of it is a division of labor—if I cook and someone else does the dishes, of course, the dishes get done—but part of it is just me needing external motivation. What I’m concerned about is this: If I ever have the means to move out, and if I end up living with a potential future partner, isn’t that unfair to them? Surely even someone who loves me won’t want to be responsible for making sure I behave like a functional adult? I feel an enormous amount of shame about my inability to handle this on my own, and I’m worried that it will sour any romantic relationship beyond repair. Will it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I think stigma around having ADD has made you feel like your challenges are somehow more shameful than those of people who don’t have a diagnosis. They’re not! Everyone brings their own stuff to a relationship, including some qualities that could be considered “unfair” to a partner. Student loan debt. Ailing parents. Seasonal affective disorder. Hair that falls out and clogs up the tub. Snoring. A person who wants to be in a relationship with you will do it because you’ve been honest about what it’s like to live with you and because they’ve decided the good qualities you bring to the table balance out your shortcomings. Be totally transparent about what you can and can’t do, what you’re working on (there probably are some strategies you could use, with the help of a counselor or coach), and what’s a permanent part of your life. And make sure you remember that you have strengths and delightful quirks, too (you didn’t list them but I’m sure you do). There’s more to being in a relationship than housekeeping.\n\nQ. Ballet: I’m a senior in high school. One thing that I’ve always loved is ballet. I love watching it and analyzing it, and I used to dance when I was very young. However, I had to be pulled out because I kept getting skin infections and lung problems. Even now, I still look back on that and I feel sick because of how much I wanted to continue. I remember crying in my parents’ arms when they told me I wouldn’t go back. I tried to forget it until two people came into my life. Both are incredibly skilled dancers, both with experience in ballet. So much so that one of them does it professionally, and the other is currently being recruited. Every single time they bring up their experiences I can’t help but feel some jealousy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI value both of them highly, one of them is my best friend. I would defend them to the moon and back! I can’t just go “Hey, whenever you bring up the fact you’re literally basically a pro in what was one of my dreams as a kid it kinda makes me feel like crawling in a sewer and getting eaten by a croc!” and ask them never to talk about it. They’re passionate about what they do, and I love that for them! I attend performances, compliment their dancing, and I will happily watch videos they show me about their skills. I just feel so terrible about being so jealous of something that will never come to fruition for me.\n\nI don’t want to go into ballet professionally anymore—and there is no possible way I could. From what I’ve seen, I don’t even have a chance to go en pointe. But still, seeing two close people in my life excel in something that I barely ever had a chance to do makes me almost want to mourn, and I don’t even know why. It’s been almost 10 years. How do I get over this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: Congratulations on handling the jealousy. Seriously. It says a lot about you that you’ve been such a good, supportive friend to these people who remind you so much of something you desperately want for yourself.\n\nNow listen carefully: Sign up for a ballet class! Your health is better now. You’re barely older than Misty Copeland was when she started! I’m not saying you’ll go pro—I believe you that you won’t. And I’ll take your word for it that you might not even go en pointe. But you love ballet and you can do ballet a few times a week if you want. You don’t have to keep getting better and better. You can just do as much ballet as your body allows, and enjoy it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen, and if, you feel like you’ve maxed out, I can see one of two scenarios happening: Either you shift to a different kind of dance (like modern, hip-hop, or tap that gives you a new challenge, a new group of people to learn with, and opportunities to perform) or you find a way to get involved in ballet in a different way. Could you teach toddlers? Or work at a dance summer camp? Or get a part-time job doing something on the administrative side for a studio or company? The opportunities are endless and I really believe your passion will lead you to something that’s a much better use of your time and energy than suppressing jealousy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris: That’s it for today, friends.

The birthday girl invited male and female schoolmates to the party, all around 15-to-17-year-olds. My wife started to put on her one-piece swimsuit to join the swimming until I stopped her.

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy partner and I are both queer women (I’m cis, she’s trans), formerly-religious 30-somethings. I went to private Christian school for my entire K-12 education, and her dad is a pastor in a similarly conservative Christian denomination to the one I was raised in, so to a certain degree we are both well-versed in experiencing homophobia from a religious standpoint. However, as I’m cis, I clearly have not had to experience the transphobia my partner has. We’ve been dating for about a year, and her religious parents and other family refuse to use my partner’s correct name or pronouns. Over our first major holidays together, I asked her how she normally dealt with being dead-named by family, and I did as requested and simply corrected any use of their deadname in conversations I was a part of, as though her family was just being silly and forgetting, but not addressing the whole “hey you’re literally using the wrong name” thing directly.\n\nClearly, my partner and I have different ways of dealing with conflict—hers is to minimize conflict in the first place, and mine is to get the conflict over and dealt with. She has done years of the slow and gentle, hope-they’ll-catch-on-eventually method. But I think my methods might be more successful here!\n\nI would like to know if (and, if so, when) it would be appropriate for me to more directly address the way my partner is treated by their family. Her chosen, everyday nickname is one letter off from her deadname. One of the most famous figures of the early Christian church changed his name by one letter. At the next holiday, I would love nothing more than to stand up and say “your child’s name is not [deadname], and if you can call the apostle Paul ‘Paul’ and not ‘Saul,’ then you can and will call your child by the name she has asked you to use.” And then very loudly correct everyone all day. And maybe call everyone “Saul” until they start using the right name, to dig the point in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’m begrudgingly willing to Not Do That and either wait to address it later and with less fanfare when our relationship is further established, or continue to follow my partner’s lead in not pressing the issue at all even though it hurts her deeply to be reminded on an ongoing basis that her family does not support or accept who she is. But I’m very bad at policing my facial expressions when I’m upset, and if that’s what I need to do around my partner’s family, then I will need to start practicing sooner rather than later. Any advice would be appreciated!\n\n—Can I Debate Your Dad for You?\n\nDear Debate,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would highly advise against delivering this lecture in any form to your partner’s parents. For one thing, this is still a relatively new relationship for you two. At this stage, you very much need to let your partner set the tone for how to deal with her family (and vice versa), since your family units are not officially combined in any capacity. If you were married, there would be some gray area for how you both could deal with parents and in-laws as a team, but even so, I’m of the mind that other people’s family dynamics are mysterious, idiosyncratic, and rarely worth interfering with. (The exception to this would be in cases where someone is being harmed; if your partner was dealing with outright verbal or emotional abuse from her parents, which isn’t how she seems to view the dead-naming, this would be a different situation.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your partner has asked you to correct their habit of deadnaming and misgendering in a specific and limited way, I would stick to your partner’s wishes. As you noted, your partner’s experience as a trans person is vastly different from your experience as a cis person, which is all the more reason to let her take the lead on how to approach this issue with her family. Put more bluntly: When it comes to matters of identity and family, you have to respect your partner’s wishes and defer to her. You may not agree with her approach (and you’re probably going to show it via your expressions), but you do have a duty to not make these scenarios any more confrontational or awkward than your partner would like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy boyfriend “Ben” and I moved in together a few months ago. Before we moved in, we had some very in-depth talks about how our lives would look. I was pretty happy with the way we were dividing chores, because both of us had opposite likes and dislikes in that area. I’ve started to realize, though, that the time spent on chores is a major sticking point. For example, Ben loves to cook. He will often spend more than an hour on a regular weeknight dinner, longer on the weekends. In contrast, when I was living on my own, I meal prepped, and ate a lot of leftovers to limit my time in the kitchen as much as possible. I am completely fine with that quality of meal and have told Ben multiple times that I would be fine if he worked less on his meals. He said he liked to put the effort in and liked the quality of food, so he was fine with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, apparently, he is only fine with this as long as I am putting in approximately an equal amount of time on my chores. I do laundry, but he wants me to iron most of his clothes and put them away in a very well-presented way, which he himself did not do before we got together. After a few passive aggressive comments, I finally found out that he expected that living together would “elevate” our lifestyle. He did mention that when we were talking, but he didn’t mention that in relation to chores, he mentioned it in the context of nicer nights out and nicer vacations. We both make good money, so I was fine with that. I am not, however, fine with spending way more time on chores than I did when I was single.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI brought this up to Ben, and he mentioned that he too was spending more time making our lives better. This has become a very contentious issue between us for the past week. I thought we were clear on chores and that we would be lightening up the load for each other. Ben thought he had been clear about wanting us to improve our homes. I am at a loss because I think everything he wants is incredibly bougie. I don’t want to spend twice as much time doing chores, I just don’t. We’re at a bit of an impasse; how do we move forward?\n\n—Chore Choked\n\nDear Choked,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand where your boyfriend is coming from in terms of wanting to feel like both of you are making “equal” contributions to the household, but it’s unfair of him to use his standard for elaborate daily meals as leverage for you to adhere to his standards for laundry. He’s framing this issue as a matter of an equal exchange of tasks, but it sounds to me like he’s putting his needs first in both situations: he gets to decide how to handle the cooking, and he gets to decide how the laundry is done? That doesn’t sound fair at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yes, it sounds like you and your boyfriend need to further negotiate the lifestyle you both want to share as a couple, but I think you also need to, uh, negotiate the need for negotiation. First, I think you should come to an agreement that it’s time to do your cooking separately for a while—this way, you can remove that issue as a “bargaining chip” temporarily. Use that time to engage your boyfriend in lower-stakes negotiations about what you both need in the house together, and about what you envision for your lives together in the near future. Take note of how open he is to negotiation and compromise: You want to get a sense for how rigid he is about his standards, and whether he realizes that it’s unfair that everything has to rise to his level of expectation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, in my view, the whole point of moving in with a partner is to make everyone’s lives easier. If that ends up being a point of disagreement, then it may be time to consider moving out and reassessing whether your relationship is better served under a more independent arrangement.\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

My husband has been letting himself go lately. My parents raised me on a diet of take-out and junk food, my father died of a heart attack when I was quite young, and my mom is morbidly obese and has serious challenges getting around. As a result, I am a bit sensitive about healthy eating and try to model good behaviors to my kids. My husband crushing a family-sized bag of M&Ms or ordering pizza for all of us seriously undermines that. Prior conversations with my mom about her eating habits went as badly as you might expect and I don’t want to make the same mistakes, but I am worried by my husband’s weight and think we’re not on the same page about parenting our children.\n\n—Fat Shaming Mommy\n\nDear Mommy,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are actually two separate conversations that you need to have with your husband. The first is to address his health and his eating habits. I think you know, as you must have experienced with your mother, that this kind of conversation can be pretty limited.\n\nAll you can really do is to express respect for your husband’s autonomy while also communicating your concerns for his well-being. Something along the lines of, “You’re an adult, and I can’t tell you what to do with your body, but I am dying with worry that you’re not taking as good of care of yourself lately. Is everything okay?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf he says he’s fine, the only other thing you can really underscore is that his well-being directly affects the well-being of both your relationship and the entire family’s well-being—“I/We depend on you so much” should be the prevailing vibe, not “You’re doing X wrong, and I’m telling you why.” Beyond that, you may be left at a pretty common impasse on this as a couple. This is, unfortunately, the epic downside of sharing our lives with people we love: They will constantly make choices that we don’t approve of, and we have to deal with the consequences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversation about modeling healthy eating habits for your kids should be slightly more straightforward: It’s not so much a matter of changing someone’s personal habits as it is deciding what is acceptable for the kids to “see.” You may find that you will have to offer to take the lead most of the time on meal planning, grocery-shopping, etc. for the family at large, and in return, you can try to negotiate that your husband keep his snacking more private, or that he defers to you on the matter of family dinners. It’s not an ideal solution where your husband magically changes his habits for the better of the family, but it may be better than your current situation.\n\nWant more Prudie?

She bullied and humiliated me relentlessly, which played a big part in my subsequent depression and eating disorder. Her one gift was to motivate me to get as far away from her and the home we lived in as I could. I studied hard enough to get a scholarship, worked various side hustles and got the hell out, got therapy, got a degree, got a great job, and never looked back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I’m doing great, and I’m not ashamed to admit that I also take quite a lot of satisfaction in the fact that my stepsister isn’t. She was a classic failure to launch. Barely finished high school, fell pregnant to a druggie dirtbag who hit her before dumping her, had another kid and now lives with my dad and her mom.\n\nThe problem is that I do not want to see her and will not visit my home if she is there. My stepmother, who is lovely but didn’t do anything to defend me, is eager to resolve the situation and has also asked me to contribute financially because the family is struggling. I pointed out that my father would be fine if he wasn’t subsidizing her daughter, who I hate, and her two children. Now I’m getting it in the neck from my dad for being “relentless and cruel,” my stepmother isn’t speaking to me at all, and other family members that I actually care about are being dragged into the dispute. I just want to draw a line under this without conceding anything, apologizing when I have done nothing wrong, or giving any money to a woman I despise. Is that ever going to be possible?\n\n—Sister Hater\n\nDear Sister Hater,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot any time soon. To be blunt, if your dad and stepmother are currently under major financial stress, they’re honestly not in a place where they’re going to thoughtfully consider your emotional needs. I think it’s great that you drew a boundary for yourself regarding your stepsister, but you can’t really blame your family members for being angry that you won’t help them out.\n\nObviously, you have your reasons. If your dislike and anger for your stepsister (and stepmother) truly prevents you from finding it meaningful to help your dad, that’s your choice.\n\nBut I think you will have to accept that withholding your money isn’t going to magically make anyone come around to your side. I think you need a bit of distance from your family to work through this anger and disappointment for a while, ideally with a great therapist or support group, so that you can get yourself to a place where you’re less bothered about what your family members think of you—or what they ask of you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet Even More Advice From the Dear Prudence Podcast\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy best friend of 50 years lives a different state. We enjoy seeing each other a couple times of year. We also enjoy traveling together, especially as we are both widowed with neither of us having remarried. Since retiring a few years ago, we’ve managed to take at least one significant trip together each year. We are great travel partners, like going at the same pace, and genuinely find joy in discovering the world. My friend has a bucket list country she’d like to visit, and while it’s not high on my list, I’ve gladly agreed to go with her and we’ve started to make preliminary plans for next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that a close friend of my friend has invited themselves to also go on this trip. This is not the first time this has happened. While I like this other friend, she is significantly younger than we are and likes a faster pace of travel. From a logistical standpoint, traveling in three’s can be challenging. I also feel, at times, like a third wheel when I’m with the two of them (they live in the same city and see each other several times a week). I’ve told my friend in the past that I would prefer we keep our travel plans between the two of us. But they feel they have no choice but to agree when their friend asks to come along.\n\nNext year is a long way away, and a lot can change. But I’m tempted to tell my friend sooner rather than later that for this particular trip, I’m bowing out and they should plan to go without me. As mentioned, this country is not a high priority for me. I also know myself and can see becoming a grouchy traveler in the circumstances. I want to honor my friendship but not sure how to handle this. Especially as it has become a pattern the last few years. What say you?\n\n—Wholly Booked\n\nDear Booked,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think you can tell your friend pretty much what you said in your letter: You’re bowing out on this trip because this country isn’t high priority for you, and you can already tell that you’re going to be a grouchy traveler. (You don’t even need to explicitly mention the issue of her friend, but if you wanted to, you could be honest and say that you don’t think you can keep up with everyone as part of a trio). Reiterate your desire to go on a “just us” trip with your friend soon, and be clear about how important it is for you to have that one-on-one bonding time with her. If she keeps being unable to draw a line with her friend, gently remind her that you may have to bow out of plans again, since traveling as a trio is honestly a little too taxing for you.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m trying to figure out what to do about a mom at my son’s school. She has a son one year older than mine who screamed at my son after school that he could not play with him and his friends. He has also been rude and mean to my son before. I asked the mom if I could tell him not to yell at my son; she said yes and I did. He didn’t seem to care. I asked the mom about it and she didn’t care either. I see this as a possible beginning of bullying and don’t want my son to have to deal with this as I did when I was young. So, I’ve been avoiding her and her kids. Problem is, one of my best friends is good friends with her too and keeps groups texting us random things. We used to all go places together, like movies, parks and zoos, so it’s a little sad, but I have no problem cutting her off. What in the best way to do this with the least drama and making sure there is minimal effects on the kids?\n\n—Pondering Mama\n\nDear Mama,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think it’s fine for you to tell your best friend (one-on-one) that your son simply doesn’t get along with this other boy, and that you and his mother have both agreed to let the boys grow up a little on their own first. Tell your best friend that you still value your friendship with her, but that you’d like to be left out of the group chats for the time being. There’s no need to go into depth about the boys’ relationship or their histories; just be direct and leave it at “they’re not getting along.”\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy brother and his wife had my niece from a donated embryo—and plan to never tell her about it. Despite the fact that you can get cheap ancestry tests off Amazon.

People have a right to their own histories and what made this any different from a regular adoption? My sister-in-law got angry and yelled at me. She gave birth, she was the mom here, and DNA is not anything to that bond. I am not disagreeing.

It’s anonymous!\n\nDear Good Job,\n\nI’m applying for traditional employment after being self-employed for over seven years. I’m very proud of my company and I have many ways of positioning my work, the results I’ve achieved, and my client feedback. However, without getting into too much detail, I don’t think only listing this one role is enough for a compelling resume.\n\nThe major problem is how my last job in 2018 ended. I was wearing 10 different hats at a small consulting firm for an erratic boss. It was just me and him in the office because the rest of our team was installed in offices across the country. I briefly met or emailed with our staff and clients but never developed relationships with any of them. My boss, the owner of the company, suffered an apparent mental breakdown in my last few months with the company.\n\nHe spent hours in my office each morning talking to me about his personal life as if I were his therapist, and then would take calls to his actual therapist, his life coach, his business coach, his divorce lawyer, etc. while he paced around in the office common space ALL day long. When I put in my notice, I told him I was simply ready to relocate to the next town over and therefore wanted to start my freelance career—no hard feelings. He seemed really happy for me and understood, but then I didn’t see him for my entire notice period.\n\nWe agreed I would train my replacement, but one day, I was suddenly locked out of all my company resources. He didn’t respond to my calls and emails to figure out what was up or to get my last paycheck (which I would have had to process myself!). I was so exhausted from his antics and had freelance work stacking up, so I gave up and kept my laptop instead of pursuing my final check. My boss started calling me a week later asking why I wasn’t showing up to the office as if he had forgotten that I quit. I never returned his call.\n\nI’m hoping most jobs won’t bother to check references or past work, but it’s hard to imagine they’ll just take my word for all the work I’ve done in my career. And there is some very key technical experience I developed at the firm that I want to share in my resume. If I’m asked why I can’t provide a contact for my most recent supervisor, I have no idea what to say! The whole situation was so messy and really centered on my boss’s mental health struggles and inappropriate behavior. Can you give me some ideas for navigating this situation if it comes up?\n\n—Sketchy Work History\n\nDear Sketchy Work History,\n\nWhat a nightmare. I’m sorry your former boss made his personal life your problem, and then treated you that way after you quit.\n\nNow that you’re ready to go back onto the job market, I would keep two things in mind. One, your new job might not check references. But, if they do, I wonder if you’ve considered reaching back out to this boss. It’s been seven years, after all. Hopefully, this period in his life was a blip and he has gotten the help he needed and would be open to being a reference for you. (It’s possible he’s embarrassed about how he treated you during those last few months, too—and would welcome an opportunity to make amends.) However, proceed with caution—if you get the sense that he is still behaving erratically or harboring any resentment toward you, back off.\n\nIf the former boss is a non-starter, you could reach out to some of your former colleagues and ask if they would be willing to have a quick call with you. I know you said you weren’t close, but if you explain the situation with your former boss in broad strokes, hopefully at least one of them would be willing to be a reference for you. But don’t discount a reference from a trusted client you’ve worked with during your freelancing stint. They can speak to your work over the past seven years, and share what you’ve been up to recently—much better than your former boss can. Good luck out there on the job market!\n\n—Doree\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nI don’t have kids but a number of my peers now have babies and toddlers, which means I’ve heard an awful lot of my smart, articulate friends talking about themselves in the third person, like Elmo.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "This article contains spoilers for the Season 2 finale of Severance, “Cold Harbor.”\n\nSeverance began as a show about office drones desperate to escape a psychic prison, but in its second season, the severed floor of Lumon Industries has started to feel more like a gilded cage. In response to the attempted jailbreak staged by the workers of Macrodata Refinement at the end of the first season, Lumon, a sprawling global conglomerate with nebulous but undoubtedly sinister aims, introduced a series of workplace reforms aimed at placating their restive employees. But they were mostly either cosmetic—upgraded vending-machine snacks!—or unenforceably vague, and the promises of a more open and human workplace quickly faded away once it became clear that Mark S. (Adam Scott) and his fellow rebels weren’t likely to be bought off with a few insubstantial gestures. The outdoor field trip presented as a team-building perk took place in a frozen, depopulated wasteland, and the long-awaited consummation of Mark’s romance with his fellow refiner Helly (Britt Lower) was marred by the discovery that he’d actually slept with her real-world outie, Helena Eagan, who’d been posing as her severed self in order to spy for the company. Irving B. (John Turturro), the Lumon old-timer whose outie retains enough subconscious knowledge of Lumon’s hidden depths for it to surface in his artwork, saw through Helena’s ruse, and Helly was returned to her rightful place, with no knowledge of what her body had been up to in her absence. But Helena’s night with Mark, the longest and most intimate interaction between an innie and outie in the show’s history, set off a string of philosophical questions. Are the innies truly distinct individuals from the outies? And if they are truly separate people, which ones are we meant to be pulling for?\n\nLong-running TV shows—and Severance has been on the air for three years, even if it’s only managed 19 episodes in that span—inevitably end up deepening their characters, discovering or inventing sides to them we’d never suspected were there. Often, though not always, that means making them more sympathetic. In the show’s second season, we learned that Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette), the Lumon zealot who ran the severed floor like a petty tyrant, was once a child laborer in one of the company’s factories, and was exiled to middle management while the company’s CEO, Helena’s father, took credit for her invention of the severance procedure, which might be the company’s most valuable asset. Her replacement, Seth Milchick, was an officious terror in his own right, but in Season 2, the show has delved more explicitly into the tensions inherent in being an ambitious Black employee in a largely white company, navigating aggressions both micro- and macro- while keeping a corporate-approved grin on his face. New villains emerged to take their place as uncomplicated heavies, including the hulking corporate enforcer Drummond (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) and the sinister Dr. Mauer (Robby Benson).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Severance​ Nails One Particularly Fraught Aspect of the Workplace Read More\n\nThe core MDR quartet of Mark, Helly, Irving, and Dylan (Zach Cherry) have all grown more complicated, too, spurred by Helly’s resistance to the Lumon-dictated status quo. (For most of the first season, she has no idea her outie is the heir apparent to the entire company, but she seems have to retained a vestigial sense that she’s meant for better things.) With no sense of what the outside world was like—after Mark is briefly able to awaken his innie self while aboveground, his co-workers enviously ask him to describe the sky—the innies had nothing better to hope for. But like Eve in the garden, Helly opened up possibilities too tempting to be forgotten. What if the MDR crew, whose job consists of sorting clusters of numbers into boxes on a computer monitor, actually knew what they were doing, rather than just being assured their work is “mysterious and important”? What if they could go outside, live their lives, or even just consciously exist for more than the length of an eight-hour day? What if work wasn’t all there is?\n\nAre the innies truly distinct individuals from the outies, and if they are truly separate people, which ones are we meant to be pulling for?\n\nThe more we’ve seen of the outside world, though, the less it seems worth fighting to inhabit it. Mark’s outie is still deep in grieving the death of his wife, Dylan inhabits what seems to be a comfortable but essentially loveless marriage, and Irving lives alone in a dark apartment, possibly suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from a past military deployment. These are lives to escape from, not to. Helena Eagan may be part of the elite, but her life, which we finally got a glimpse of in the second season’s penultimate episode, looks like a high-end version of utter misery: swimming solitary laps and eating a desultory breakfast under the unnervingly watchful eye of her father, who looks and sounds like a lightly reanimated corpse. Even the people who don’t work at Lumon seem to live in an environment suffocated by its influence, a gray, endless winter devoid of joy or fulfillment. (On the Severance podcast, director Ben Stiller proudly noted that the scenes flashing back to Mark’s life with his wife, Gemma, are virtually the only time in the show’s history we’ve seen a tree with leaves on it.) It’s as if the outer world is also cut off from something vital. The severed floor might be, as Helly reminds us in the second-season finale, “hell,” but at least they’ve got snacks. There’s no place like work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn order to sustain an audience, a television show has to make its central location a pleasant place for its viewers, if not its characters, to spend time in. Lumon’s endless corridors convey a numbing repetition, but they’re a dazzling white, and the retro-modernist design of its office spaces is enthralling in its immaculate specificity. That goes for the characters as well. Because Mark is the show’s central figure, we spend roughly as much time with each of his selves—the second season’s first two episodes replay the same series of events from his outie’s and innie’s perspectives—but his co-workers’ outies are essentially strangers to us, no substitute for the innies we’ve come to know and love. When innies end their employment, either by choice or otherwise, they effectively die; it’s not clear whether their severed selves get permanently deleted or just lie dormant, like a file they’re not allowed to open. Leading into the second-season finale, the show toyed with the idea that both Irving’s and Dylan’s innies might be gone for good: The former, fired for attempting to drown the future head of the company, boards a train heading for points unknown, and the latter, who’s developed unrequited feelings for his outie’s wife, voluntarily resigns in an effort to end his own suffering. These ought, at least in theory, to be moments of triumph—free at last. But as TV viewers, we don’t want change, at least of the kind that deprives of us of more time with our favorite make-believe friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second-season finale, “Cold Harbor,” brings this conflict to a head. Mark’s outie has been hatching a plan to rescue Gemma, who, instead of being dead, has been effectively held prisoner inside Lumon for the past few years. But to do it, he needs his innie’s help. Although Mark has been attempting an experimental reintegration process that would fuse his inner and outer selves, the procedure is still buggy and impermanent, so the only way for the two to communicate is by passing messages back and forth via video camera. Mark’s outie begs his innie to help with the rescue, warning him that completing the file he has been working on will result in her death. But Mark S. quickly realizes that the plan essentially involves killing himself. He’s in love, too, with Helly, but there’s no chance their outies would feel the same way. Mark’s outie tries to act like he sympathizes, but a crucial slip of the tongue—he calls the woman Mark S. loves “Heleny”—reveals how little he knows, and, truthfully, cares, about the inner life of his severed self. As far as Mark’s outie is concerned, his innie isn’t a real person, just a mistake he’s hoping to undo, and for Mark’s innie, that means there isn’t much difference between his original self and the company he works for—except that Lumon, at least for now, still wants him around. And so Mark’s innie makes a devastating but inevitable choice: He frees Gemma and then locks himself back inside, choosing a life of captivity with Helly over the freedom of oblivion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Severance podcast, listeners call in to a weekly advice line where they ask questions as if they’re Lumon employees, frequently signing off with an enthusiastic “Praise Kier.” It’s a little odd to hear them cosplaying as members of the Eagans’ corporate cult, but it also fits the culture that has grown up around the show, where fans and advertisers alike voluntarily insert themselves into its dystopian world. Stiller’s podcast ads pitch project-management software as a less cumbersome alternative to the severance procedure—despite the show’s entry-level POV, its marketing is aimed squarely at management—and Lumon even has its own LinkedIn page. Severance has come to function like a lavish science-fiction version of Dilbert, whose strips about the humiliations of corporate life were pinned inside every cubicle in every office I worked in as an office temp, skewering the mind-numbing repetition and alienation of the characters’ jobs while forging a kind of fatalistic camaraderie: Sure, this is terrible, but at least we’re in it together. Life on the severed floor is degrading and inhumane, but when all your friends are there, it’s better than no life at all.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nLast summer, we here at Slate reported on a candy sensation that was sweeping—or, I guess more accurately, bumpily rolling—across the nation: Nerds Gummy Clusters. In case you have somehow dodged them, these are what many consider to be the platonic incarnation of Nerds—a soft, chewy gelatin sphere studded all over with the familiar hard, tart pellets. Clusters are an undeniable triumph of industrial food science, delivering, as a company spokesperson put it, “our original crunchy Nerds in a mess-free and multi-sensorial experience.” Amazing stuff.\n\nBut sometime last fall, a new and perhaps unlikely confectionary contender sneaked into the ring to vie for the title of “It Candy.” Enter: freeze-dried sweets, a further innovation from the food labs that takes classic candies and inflates them into crunchy, powdery, mouth-coating sugar bombs. Indeed, freeze-dried candy has been the topic of so much conversation these past few months that big brands have started to hop on the trend. Now, you can get freeze-dried Skittles and Jolly Ranchers alongside the regular versions at your local stores. Horrifyingly, these are not only being marketed as “snacks,” but also—if we are to believe Jolly Rancher’s senior manager of equity and activation—“a total flavor revolution.”\n\nIf freeze-drying sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the process more often used to preserve meats, fruits, and veggies, where the foods are frozen and then dehydrated under pressure. I most commonly see the fruit varieties, either eaten alone as snacks or used to add a little fruity surprise into bowls of oatmeal or yogurt. The process turns anything into a crunchy, almost massless, puff—and people, particularly TikTok’s younger demographic, apparently love it. As one TikTok foodie exclaimed, brittle Nerds Gummy Clusters (yes, they’ve been dragged into this too) are like “like candy popcorn.” Sorry, caramel corn! Your time is past.\n\nTikTok is no stranger to saccharine trends, recently popularizing global sweets like Dubai chocolate, Chinese tanghulu (to the detriment of some children), and Swedish gummies. Now, videos of people crunching on store-bought freeze-drieds and even desiccating their own nostalgic treats—gummy worms, Snickers, SweeTARTs, and more—have been racking up millions of views on the app. And that’s to say nothing of the trend’s presence on Reddit threads, where users are debating en masse the merits of regular Skittles or Sour Skittles when crunchified. The growing demand for the crispy goods has even led to the establishment of tons of boutique candy shops offering freeze-dried options, whether through their own sites or secondary sellers like Etsy and Amazon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might think all of this hubbub would have been enough to make the freeze-dried phenomenon worthy of an assessment sooner, but the trend somehow evaded me. It wasn’t until it was brought up in a Slate Slack channel that I became aware of the craze. Sara Burningham, a senior podcast producer, alerted me that her 11-year-old daughter, Ronnie, absolutely loves the stuff. Ronnie first saw the “craze” online via a YouTuber who would freeze-dry candy and use it as currency to, for example, pay their babysitter. When Ronnie finally tried the sweets, she became obsessed because they taste “really good,” with the same flavor but “a different overall experience,” as they crunch first but then satisfyingly dissolve in the mouth. Ronnie loved them so much that she has since been experimenting with making other Franken-candy creations herself. (When asked if she would accept freeze-dried candy as pay for babysitting, Ronnie replied that she would be “so happy for that.”) It was upon this ringing endorsement that I finally decided, What the hell, I wanna crunch my corn syrup, too!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo try out the fad, I ordered a variety of bestsellers from a store specializing in freeze-dried candies. They arrived in bags labeled with hilarious off-brand names: the Skittles became “Shell Shocks”; the Starburst became “Mini Crunchers”; and everything had the word Original before it. (Original what remains unclear.) I was also able to sample some dehydrated gummy worms, peach rings, cotton-candy saltwater taffy, Lemonheads, and even a classic ice cream sandwich.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReader, here’s the deal: While some are pretty good, some are absolutely nonsensical. As in, they press the limits of what could even be defined as “candy” to unsightly degrees. If David Cronenberg—cinema’s resident well-respected sicko—could imagine a treat for children, these would be it. Food for freaks, if you will.\n\nIt turns out that the freeze-drying process does drastically different things, depending on the type of candy run through the blaster. The smaller, denser sweets—like Skittles, Lemonheads, Starburst—remained my favorite of the bunch. Their texture is like an airier version of the original form, retaining a little bit of density. If you want the flavor of a Skittle, but with a satisfying, cereal-like crunch rather than the traditional sticky chew—as I often do, because I’m not munchin’ if I’m not crunchin’—then these are perfect. On the other end of the spectrum, the cotton-candy taffy ones are truly horrible and had the texture of fruity baby powder packed into solid form. A botched experiment, I’m sorry to say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the most bizarre transformation here involves gummies—the worms and the peach rings. The process essentially turns the stretchy delicacies into a candy cheese-puff. You know, the ones that crunch but are all air in the middle and get stuck all in your teeth? One of my colleagues saw me trying them in the office kitchen and asked, “Is that space food?” He soon found out that the answer was yes. While the peach rings remain somewhat tasty, if odd, the gummy worms are a totally different experience on the tastebuds. The sublimation process (or whatever, I took collegiate chemistry a decade ago) also intensifies the flavor, making the worms sourer than usual and nearly unbearable in their artificially flavored sweetness. Not to brag, but usually I can pound gummy, well, anything, really, by the handful. I couldn’t stomach more than one and a half of these at a time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess that could be considered a good thing, because you’re only getting a handful in a $7 bag ($5, when I got them on sale). And that brings me to my real issue with this trend: What is the point? The novelty ones that drastically change the form of a beloved original are just that—novelty, and at a much higher price point. They’re harder to transport without them getting crushed into bits, and the math of consumption gets a little wonky: Kids could probably consume a lot more than they should because they’re so light.\n\nHowever, the worst crime being committed here is that freeze-drying takes the particular joys out of eating candy, with its variety of textures and flavors meted out perfectly enough that you could down a whole bag of Haribo without noticing. The best example of this is the ice cream sandwich. While I concede that the chocolate cookie was delicious (it tasted like a lighter chocolate biscuit, in the British sense, and I could eat 500 of them), the overall presentation was unimpressive. The ice cream just tasted sweet, not ice-cream-y at all, and wasn’t satisfying. I will be the first to admit that ice cream sandwiches aren’t particularly gourmet—it’s not like there’s vanilla-bean ice cream in between those soft sandwich cookies, which, themselves, taste only like the idea of chocolate rather than the real thing—but they have a classic, gratifying “ice cream sandwich” flavor. Moreover, they have a place in society! They are refreshing on a relaxed summer day; there’s nostalgia in the cookie getting stuck to your fingers, and the melting is half the fun. I can appreciate the need for a little textural variety, but that’s why some genius invented the Chipwich. I have never found myself wondering, You know what would be good right now? An only crunchy, not-ice-cream, room-temp ice cream sandwich.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love a crunch as much as the next girl (probably more, to be honest), but in the final analysis, I found that freeze-drying takes away the delightful specificity of the experience of eating cavity-inducing treats. The squish, the stretch, the fun shapes and translucent colors, the almost indestructible makeup of them, perfect for nearly any climate except extreme heat. While I can see some applications worthy of this new invention—peach-ring shards sprinkled over some real ice cream?—I remain baffled. Is this a sign that I’m aging out of the “cool” generation? Perhaps. But unlike Nerds Gummy Clusters, which have seemingly redefined that candy for all time, I’d bet buckets of chocolate coins that the freeze-drying phenomenon will be short-lived, eventually pulverized by the weight of its hubris and blown away, leaving nothing but “Shell Shocks” powder on the wind.",

        "content": "Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nWelcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a newsletter that calls for the immediate impeachment of any “radical left” readers who don’t scroll all the way to the end.\n\nAs for the news … well, at least the weather’s getting nicer? This week, we didn’t learn anything new about who killed JFK, but we did learn the Social Security numbers of various living American citizens. A humbled Chuck Schumer submitted himself to continued punishment on television. A wussy law firm caved to Trump, something the Surge will never do (for less than a couple hundred bucks).\n\nBut let’s begin with the constitutional crisis du jour!\n\n1. James Boasberg\n\nThe biggest whiners in the history of the universe.\n\nWe believe this should be obvious, but we notice in the Trump era that some obvious things are never plainly put: Just a couple of months in, the Republican Party has forever lost the ability to complain about any Democrat trying to “delegitimize” the courts. This week’s effort of coordinated, premeditated delegitimization of the judiciary from the very bottom to the very top of the MAGA coalition was centered on James “Jeb” Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. District Court. He told the administration that it couldn’t quite yet use its new statutory toy from 1798 to round up some guys with tattoos, call them gang members, and quick schlep them out of the country, ordering any such flights that had taken off to return to the U.S. The administration disobeyed that completely, and Boasberg has been understandably upset, which only got worse as he asked for more information and was repeatedly rebuffed.\n\nFor his efforts, Trump has called Boasberg a “Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge,” and a “troublemaker and agitator” who didn’t win any swing states in the 2024 election, and said he should be impeached. Attorney General Pam Bondi, boldly, accused Boasberg of “meddling in our government.” Elon Musk is spending to support House members who back the impeachment of Boasberg and other judges. The imbecilic “investigators” of X who believe they’ve uncovered a scandal when anyone owns an asset larger than their annual salary are on the case. (Find the dumbest politics tweet you saw in the last week, any week. The first reply will always be Musk writing, “Interesting.”) We’re seeing a staggering amount of whining and civilizational vandalism in response to being told you can’t do whatever you want to do, right away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Chuck Schumer\n\nHow enduring will the damage be?\n\nWhen it’s launch time for the Surge’s memoirs (The Surge Decade: Notes on Ranking the News), please remind us not to help Republicans keep the government funded the week before? The Senate Democratic leader canceled a tour promoting his new book on antisemitism scheduled for this week, citing “security concerns”—and it surely wasn’t easy to secure one football stadium after another in the first place. Schumer did maintain a lot of his television appearances, though, keeping a move many apoplectic Democrats viewed as treachery front and center in the news.\n\nWhat long-term damage to Schumer’s leadership, if any, is going to result from this? He’s unquestionably at his weakest position since taking over as leader in 2017. You are seeing individual Senate Democrats for the first time ever not giving straight answers when asked whether Schumer should continue to lead the caucus. We don’t think Schumer’s job is in anywhere close to real danger. This vitriolic episode will pass, and the leader only needs the votes of half of his caucus to win a leadership election, which he surely has.\n\nBut we may be seeing Democratic voters taking on a more hostile relationship to their leaders that’s reminiscent of daily life on the Republican side. In recent history, Democrats have been more appreciative of their leaders than Republicans have been, but that’s changing, fast. It wouldn’t be surprising to see Senate Democratic candidates distance themselves from the leader, or outright run ads against him, in primary campaigns going forward. Mitch McConnell lived and breathed this kind of loathing for decades, but it didn’t stop him from being the longest-serving party leader in Senate history. It probably won’t put Schumer out of a job, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Mike Johnson\n\nA new homework assignment.\n\nTrump and Musk being mad about judges on social media means that a fresh new ticket is being printed for their short-order cook, House Speaker Mike Johnson. The absurd impeachment resolution against Boasberg is locked and loaded, as are articles against other judges who’ve impeded the administration’s ability to break the law. And yet, any of these resolutions may be too dead-brained and authoritarian to get out of the House—which tells you something—let alone to get two-thirds of senators to vote to convict. (Not to mention that taking up these measures would be an unneeded time suck for congressional Republicans, which is why plenty of Democrats might not mind seeing it happen.)\n\nJohnson, then, is considering other approaches to the subject that might satisfy the administration. He’s considering, for example, allowing a vote on a bill from California Rep. Darrell Issa that would prevent district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions. They could also vote on huffy resolutions declaring their distaste for Boasberg et al. It goes without saying that many Republican leaders and chairmen in Congress would prefer to be focusing on tax cut legislation now instead of fanatical, internally divisive efforts to break the federal judiciary. But the boss wants what the boss wants (the boss is Trump).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Vladimir Putin\n\nMay we take your order?\n\nTrump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke this week for several hours. They both had a lovely time. In terms of practical achievements, Putin agreed to a moratorium on attacks on energy infrastructure. As for Trump’s call for a ceasefire? Putin has not agreed to that, as Ukraine has.\n\nHe hasn’t signaled that he’d agree to any meaningful concession, and understandably so, because he knows he can lead the current United States president along for a while. On a ceasefire alone, the Kremlin’s readout of the call insisted that it would have to involve ceasing Ukrainian conscription “and the rearmament of the Ukrainian armed forces.” For a broader deal, a “key condition” of Putin’s is “a complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.” (Trump, meanwhile, says aid wasn’t discussed at all.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, Russia will agree to a “peace” if the U.S. (and, presumably, European powers) leave Ukraine disarmed, unprotected, and at Russia’s mercy. And that, of course, is before taking into account Russia’s “absolute need to eliminate the root causes of the crisis and ensure Russia’s legitimate interests in the field of security”—in other words, to roll back NATO. What’s happening here is that Putin is making the bet that he can get Trump to agree to absolutely everything in exchange for economic opportunities in Russia, while continuing the assault on Ukraine in the meantime. The only hope is that Trump, for the first time ever, starts to get irritated at Putin for taking advantage of him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Paul, Weiss\n\nWhat, The, Hell?\n\n[Note to reader: The Surge spent 30 solemn minutes debating whether to extend the gag of a comma after each word throughout this paragraph—to show we mean business. Like Paul Weiss, we caved.] Last week, the Trump administration tried to shake down a third white-shoe law firm for having employed or represented people who investigated Trump. In this case, the firm was Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. The White House executive order, written in a high-tongue dialect of the Goonish language, called for suspending employees’ security clearances, limiting their access to government buildings, and putting a blanket ban on hiring them.\n\nAs with a similar order against the firm Perkins Coie, it was probably illegal and unconstitutional eight ways from Sunday. But instead of fighting it in court, Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp visited the White House this week to surrender. According to Trump, the firm will “dedicate the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump’s term to support the Administration’s initiatives” and pledged not to “adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies.” Per the New York Times, that DEI language was added by the White House after the two sides had agreed on wording. There were other discrepancies: The White House also said that Karp had “acknowledged the wrongdoing” of its former partner who investigated the Trump hush money case in New York, though HuffPost reported that Karp’s own memo to his staff included no such admission. At any rate, Trump rescinded his executive order. Surely Trump is done with these kinds of shakedowns now, right? Or do you think that such cowering could embolden him to pursue further muggings? Could go either way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. John F. Kennedy\n\nStill dead?\n\nTrump has long promised to release all of the government’s files on the JFK assassination, a process that presidents have dragged their feet on for decades. This was one of his better promises! That’s not because there’s any document, anywhere, that will satisfy people who believe the Cookie Monster was the second shooter; instead, there’s important information in there for the historic record about CIA practices at the height of the Cold War. The manner in which the files were released, though, was a mess. Trump announced during a visit to the Kennedy Center on Monday that the tens of thousands of files that the government was reviewing would be released the next day. In their haste to get this ready, the government ended up releasing Social Security numbers of hundreds of people, not all of whom are dead. Among them was Joseph DiGenova, a former campaign lawyer for Trump, who is considering suing the National Archives. The White House does at least realize how much it screwed up and is trying to control the damage, promising to issue new Social Security numbers to those who are still living. Those new cards will be there and waiting at the nearest Social Security office, a mere 10-hour drive away. More on that …\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Leland Dudek\n\nMistakes were made, and we cannot wait to make more.\n\nA lesson of the Trump era is that a lot of people will put up with a lot of bullshit so long as the Social Security checks keep flowing. Trump has always seemed to understand this. Which makes it surprising that he is allowing Musk and the interim head of the Social Security Administration, Leland Dudek, to fiddle around with the program in ways that jeopardize that flow. The agency is already at a staffing low and plans to lay off another 7,000 workers. They’re closing offices that will increase travel times for old people. At the same time, a lot more of these old people will be needing to visit field offices, because Dudek announced that, in an attempt to crack down on fraud, at the end of the month, beneficiaries will no longer be able to make certain changes by phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a recipe for a lot of angry Social Security recipients, also known as “voters.” This change was announced in the same week that Dudek sent a message to SSA employees acknowledging that “I have made some mistakes, which makes me human like you. I promise you this, I will continue to make mistakes, but I will learn from them.” Among those mistakes, presumably, was a more far-reaching plan to eliminate phone services, as well as a mysterious, petty, and short-lived policy in Maine requiring parents to register their newborns at a Social Security office. The New Golden Age of America is a longer line at a federal office building.",
