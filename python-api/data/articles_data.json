(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, file)\n\nJACKSON, Miss. -- A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant that claimed a local news outlet defamed him in public comments about its Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting on the misspending of $77 million in federal welfare funds.\n\nThe one-page ruling Friday by Madison County Circuit Court Judge Bradley Mills sided with lawyers for Mississippi Today, who had argued that the news outlet engaged in constitutionally protected speech.\n\n“For the past 22 months, we’ve vigorously defended our Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting and our characterizations of Bryant’s role in the Mississippi welfare scandal,” Mississippi Today said in a statement on its website. “We are grateful today that the court, after careful deliberation, dismissed the case.”\n\nBryant filed suit in 2023, weeks after Mississippi Today and one of its reporters, Anna Wolfe, won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of how welfare funds intended for poor Mississippians — some of the most impoverished people in the U.S. — were diverted to the rich and powerful.\n\nBryant's lawsuit didn't challenge the accuracy of Wolfe’s series, “The Backchannel,” that shed light on the welfare scandal. Instead, Bryant's lawyers argued that the news outlet, its CEO and other employees made slanderous comments about Bryant when discussing the series in public settings, including a radio interview and a speech at a journalism conference.\n\nAttorneys for Mississippi Today argued that the comments Bryant claimed had harmed his reputation were “entirely or substantially true,” and that Bryant failed to show any of the statements were made with “actual malice” — meaning they were knowingly or recklessly false. Because of that, the lawyers said, Bryant didn't meet the legal standard for politicians and other public figures to prove defamation as set by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964.\n\nBryant's attorney, William Quin II, said Monday he will appeal the judge's dismissal to the Mississippi Supreme Court.\n\n“This matter is far from over,” Quin said in an emailed statement. \"Governor Bryant remains confident in the legal basis of this case, and the righteousness of this cause.”\n\nThe nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists praised the judge's decision to throw out the lawsuit.\n\n“Suing news organizations just because you don’t like their reporting is a crude intimidation tactic that can drain resources and discourage critical coverage,” Katherine Jacobsen, the committee's U.S. program coordinator, said in a statement posted on X. \"We hope that this case serves as a deterrent to those who would seek to sue outlets into silence.”\n\nProsecutors have said the state’s human services agency gave money to nonprofit organizations that spent it on projects such as a $5 million volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi — a project for which retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre agreed to raise money.\n\nMississippi Auditor Shad White announced in February 2020 that criminal charges were brought against six people, including John Davis, a former Mississippi Department of Human Services executive director who had been chosen by Bryant. The announcement came weeks after Bryant, a Republican, finished his second and final term as governor. Davis and others have pleaded guilty.\n\nNo criminal charges have been filed against Bryant, and he has said he told the auditor in 2019 about possible misspending of money from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families antipoverty program.\n\nFavre also has not been charged with a crime. The Pro Football Hall of Famer is among more than three dozen defendants in a civil lawsuit the state filed in 2022. The suit demands repayment of money that was misspent through TANF.\n\nWhite, the Republican state auditor, said in 2020 that Favre had improperly received $1.1 million in speaking fees from a nonprofit organization that spent welfare money with approval from the state Department of Human Services. White said Favre did not show up for the speeches. Although Favre repaid the $1.1 million, White said last year that he still owes nearly $730,000 in interest.",

    "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
    "content": "The biggest mistake Democrats have made is “not centering people enough” Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said Sunday.\n\n“A lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they trusted him and didn't trust that Democrats could deliver for them,” Booker told ABC “This Week” anchor George Stephanopoulos. “We are in a state where, again, the Democratic Party should own up. We partly laid this pathway for this demagogue to come into office, and so the way we deal with that, the way we correct from those mistakes, is to do more of the centering of American voices, American people in our conversation and in our focus, not focus on politics, focus on people.”\n\nBooker’s marathon 25 hour and 4 minute speech that concluded Tuesday evening broke the record for the longest speech on the Senate floor. Booker protested the national \"crisis\" he said President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk created. It surpassed the record set by Sen. Strom Thurmond, who filibustered the Civil Rights Act for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957.\n\nDuring the speech, Booker said that Democrats must do better.\n\nSen. Cory Booker speaks with ABC News on 'This Week' April 6, 2025. ABC News\n\n“I confess that I have been imperfect. I confess that I've been inadequate to the moment,” Booker said on Tuesday. “I confess that the Democratic Party has made terrible mistakes that gave a lane to this demagogue. I confess we all must look in the mirror and say 'we will do better.'\"\n\nBooker told Stephanopoulos the action he tried to inspire with his speech should not be confused with partisan politics.\n\n“This is not about the Democratic Party, I'm sorry,” Booker said. “The Democratic Party is at its weakest when it's concerned about the party. It's at its strongest when it's concerned about the people, when it's bigger and broader than any narrow, political analysis. This is the time for Americans to step up.”\n\nTens of thousands of “Hands Off” protesters rallied in more than 1,200 cities across the country on Saturday to speak out against the Trump administration’s cuts to the federal workforce and other policies, according to organizers.\n\n“I'm just grateful, especially yesterday, to stand in solidarity with millions of Americans who are just really determined, even though they themselves are tired, to keep fighting,” Booker said.\n\nHere are more highlights from Booker’s interview:\n\nBooker on the tariffs Trump announced this week\n\nStephanopoulos: Let's talk about some of the issues that Americans were responding to, including, of course, the tariffs. You heard Kevin Hassett earlier in the program. He said there may be some increase in prices, but it's going to be worth it. Your response?\n\nBooker: God bless Kevin, but I've never seen an administration in my lifetime do something so monumentally wrong and that so staggeringly hurts American people. I've been hearing all day yesterday, from frightened Americans who've saved for their entire lives, for retirement in the coming months, but now know they can't because in one fell swoop, Donald Trump has devastated their retirement accounts, their 401(k)s… This president is pushing, yet again, a plan to gut basic services to give bigger and bigger tax cuts to the wealthy. So the chaos he has unleashed on America, the financial insecurity that he has brought to people's lives, this is not what he promised people, and I think he will already go down for a president having the worst first 100 days in the last century of any president that's ever taken that office.\n\nBooker on law firms and universities targeted by the administration\n\nStephanopoulos: “You also saw Jon Karl's piece about the president’s retribution campaign, he promised to be the retribution during the campaign. We're seeing these moves against universities. We’re seeing these moves against law firms. You took the Senate floor to protest. What should these law firms and universities do?\n\nBooker: “Well, first and foremost, you're calling retribution, but it's something far worse than that. If you look around the world, from Viktor Orban to Vladimir Putin, this is not what democratic leaders do. This is really a violation of our constitutional principles, that he's using that power of that office, not to advance noble causes that could help the American people, whether I disagree with them or not, that's what a president is called to do, do what they think is in the best interests of the public at large. What this president is instead doing is violating our constitutional principles, violating the fundamental rights of people in order to punish them, to carry out his own retribution plan. You know, John F. Kennedy famously said, “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” Donald Trump is now saying, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for Donald Trump to make amends. He is trying to hurt people, to make them cower to him and offer him tribute in order to not violate the Constitution and hurt them economically. This is something that should not just be about a bunch of law firms. This is something that should ultimately be about Americans.",

    "content": "Budget carrier Avelo Airlines says it has signed an agreement to fly deportation flights from Arizona starting in May\n\nBudget carrier Avelo Airlines signed an agreement to fly federal deportation flights from Arizona starting in May, according to the company, whose founder acknowledged the decision may be controversial.\n\nAndrew Levy, also CEO of the Houston-based airline, said Avelo is flying for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration Control and Enforcement agency as part of a “long-term charter program” to support the agency's deportation efforts. The company decided the move would help with expansion and protect jobs, he said.\n\n“We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Levy said in a statement.\n\nThe domestic and international flights will be supported by three Boeing 737-800 planes and based at Mesa Gateway Airport Flights, Avelo said in a statement.\n\nIn an online job listing for the Arizona operation, Avelo states that the “flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS’s deportation efforts.”\n\nTom Cartwright, a flight data analyst for the advocacy group Witness at the Border, whose social media feeds are closely watched in immigration circles, said he isn't aware of any other commercial airlines that have provided such flights for ICE in the past five years he's been tracking flights. He called the decision by Avelo “unusual\" considering charter companies the public likely hasn't heard of typically make these flights.\n\n“They may fly a flight with all migrants or deportation flights today and they might fly fans to the Masters golf tournament tomorrow,” he said of the charters. “They don’t sell tickets in a retail manner like Avelo does.”\n\nIn New Haven, Connecticut, where Avelo flies out of Tweed New Haven Airport, Democratic Mayor Justin Elicker said he called Levy over the weekend to express his opposition to the arrangement and urged the CEO to reconsider.\n\n“Avelo Airlines’ decision to charter deportation flights from Mesa Gateway Airport in Arizona is deeply disappointing and disturbing. For a company that champions themselves as ‘New Haven’s hometown airline,’ this business decision in antithetical to New Haven’s values,” Elicker said in a statement.\n\n“Travel should be about bringing people together, not tearing families apart,” he added.\n\nA local immigrant advocacy group called the New Haven Immigrants coalition is urging people to sign an online petition pledging to boycott the airline.\n\nICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO's military committee, was fired over the weekend by the Trump administration, U.S. officials said Monday.\n\nAlthough no reason was given, officials said it was apparently tied to comments she has made that supported diversity in the force.\n\nAccording to the officials, Chatfield got a call from Adm. Christopher Grady, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was told the administration wanted to go in a different direction with the job.\n\nThe officials said they believe the decision was made last week by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, but it was unclear whether he received any direction from President Donald Trump. Three U.S. officials spoke about the firing on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.\n\nChatfield is the third top female officer to be fired since Trump took office. Hegseth announced in February that he was firing the chief of naval operations, Adm. Lisa Franchetti. And Trump fired Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan just a day after he was sworn in.\n\nTrump and Hegseth have been vocal in their insistence that so-called woke policies are dead. There has been a vigorous campaign to remove leaders who promoted diversity, equity and inclusion, and to erase DEI programs and online content.\n\nChatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as “woke” by the conservative American Accountability Foundation, which sent a letter to Hegseth saying that “purging the woke from the military is imperative.”\n\nChatfield, a Navy helicopter pilot who also commanded a joint reconstruction team in Afghanistan, had been serving as one of the 32 representatives on NATO's military committee. The panel is the primary source of military advice to the North Atlantic Council and NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, according to NATO. It serves as the link between the political decision-makers and NATO's military structure..\n\nSen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said he was “deeply disturbed” by the firing.\n\n“Trump’s relentless attacks on our alliances and his careless dismissal of decorated military officials make us less safe and weaken our position across the world,\" Warner said in a post on X.\n\nThe campaign to erase DEI programs and online content has been met with questions from lawmakers, local leaders and citizens angered by the removal of military heroes and historic mentions from Defense Department websites and social media pages.\n\nThe accountability foundation complained in the letter to Hegseth that those responsible for DEI policies \"must be dismissed,” adding that military leaders should be focused on cultivating lethality, not on fostering diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks.\n\nThe letter said Chatfield posted supportive comments on LinkedIn about a diversity summit and gave a speech in 2015 at Women's Equality Day. The group quoted her as saying that investing in empowering women can unlock human potential.\n\nAnd they also said she was quoted as saying, “our diversity is our strength” — a phrase that Hegseth has repeatedly condemned.\n\nA native of Garden Grove, California, Chatfield graduated from Boston University and received her master's degree from Harvard University and a doctorate from the University of San Diego.\n\nShe deployed to the Pacific and the Persian Gulf as a pilot. She later served as the senior military assistant to the supreme allied commander Europe. She was awarded a Bronze Star.",

Kennedy Jr. said on Monday he plans to assemble a task force and ultimately change the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance to stop recommending adding fluoride.\n\nHis comments came during a press conference in Utah, which just became the first state to ban fluoride from drinking water systems.\n\nThe Associated Press was the first to report Kennedy's intended changes to the CDC guidance.\n\nThe CDC currently recommends the use of fluoride to prevent cavities.\n\nIf Kennedy, who has been outspoken in his support for removing fluoride from water, directs the CDC to change its guidance, it could lead to more cities and states removing fluoride from drinking water, a decision that's made on the local level.\n\n\"Fluoride should not be in the water,\" Kennedy said on Monday.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrives before President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, April 2, 2025, in Washington. Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nBut the CDC's guidance on fluoride is not enforceable, and a ban on fluoride, should it survive legal challenges, would ultimately need to come from the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, also in Utah with Kennedy on Monday, announced that the EPA, too, is reviewing \"new science\" on fluoride. EPA sets the maximum level of fluoride in water.\n\n\"We're prepared to act based on the science,\" Zeldin said at the press conference.\n\nThe review by EPA will \"inform any potential revisions to EPA's fluoride drinking water standard,\" a press release said, specifically citing a report from the National Toxicology Program, a government-run division.\n\nThe August report found lower IQ in children who had higher levels of fluoride exposure -- about twice the level recommended limit for U.S. drinking water -- and said more research is needed to determine if the small doses recommended in the U.S. cause harm.\n\nLong Island, N.Y.: Water being poured into a glass from a faucet on Long Island, New York on Oct. 4, 2022.

More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures,\" the report said.\n\nThe study was also cited in a federal judge's ruling in September that ordered the EPA to take steps to lower the potential risk of fluoride.\n\nU.S. District Judge Edward Chen said more research was needed to understand if the typical amounts of fluoride in the water in the U.S. were causing lower IQ in kids.\n\n\"I think we need to apply the cautionary principle in this country that we should do no harm,\" Kennedy said Tuesday. \"And it clearly is doing harm, and the tradeoff is IQ loss in kids, and we can't afford that in this country. We need all the brain power that we can to handle the challenges of the future.\"\n\nIn November, shortly before the election, Kennedy pledged that the Trump administration would advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water on day one.\n\nThe American Dental Association, responding to Kennedy and Zeldin's comments Tuesday, said fluoride in water was necessary for good oral health and at U.S.-recommended levels \"does not negatively impact IQ levels.\"\n\n\"The growing distrust of credible, time-tested, evidence-based science is disheartening. The myths that fluoridated water is harmful and no longer necessary to prevent dental disease is troublesome and reminds me of fictional plots from old movies like Dr. Strangelove,\" said Brett Kessler, president of the American Dental Association.\n\n\"When government officials, like Secretary Kennedy, stand behind the commentary of misinformation and distrust peer-reviewed research it is injurious to public health.\"",

Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and ardent Trump supporter, made headlines when he spoke out -- first on Fox News last week and in recent days on his podcast \"Verdict.\"\n\n\"Tariffs are a tax on consumers, and I'm not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers, so my hope is these tariffs are short-lived, and they serve as leverage to lower tariffs across the globe,\" Cruz told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow.\n\nSen.

Win Mcnamee/Getty Images\n\nCruz reiterated that point on his podcast, saying it would be a win if the administration used the policy as leverage to quickly negotiate down tariffs imposed by other nations but if it stays in place long term it could increase inflation, hurt job growth and possibly put the U.S. into a recession -- the latter of which Cruz said would result in a \"bloodbath\" for the Republican Party in the 2026 midterm election.\n\n\"If we're in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now with massive American tariffs and massive tariffs on American goods in every other country on Earth, it's a terrible outcome,\" he said on Friday.\n\nDuring an episode of his podcast on Monday, Cruz said that while Trump's tariffs were \"important\"-- especially in order to bring manufacturing jobs back to America -- it would be \"really bad\" for the country if they remain permanent rather than used as a short-term negotiation tool.\n\nCruz suggested there was a \"very active debate within the White House\" over how to move forward.\n\n\"Do we use this as leverage to lower other countries' tariffs and then lower our own tariffs to reflect that? Or do we leave these tariffs up forever and ever and ever?\" Cruz said. \"There are angels and demons… on each of President Trump's shoulders, urging him to use them as leverage or keep them forever.\"\n\nElon Musk looks on during a Cabinet Meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House Mar, 24, 2025 in Washington. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nCruz said that Elon Musk was one of the \"angels,\" based on recent comments the tech billionaire made about his hope for lower tariffs and \"complete freedom of trade between the United States and Europe.\"\n\n\"So when I talked about angels and demons … Elon is one of the angels. This is a good, good voice that is focused on us, jobs that I hope the president is listening to. I hope the president is listening to Elon Musk.\"\n\nAsked on Monday to respond to the comments from his fellow Texas Republican, Sen. John Cornyn told reporters, \"Obviously nobody wants a recession, but I expect -- it looks like here at least in the near term -- that there's deals to be made. And President Trump if he's anything he's a deal maker and I remain hopeful that a deal can be made on many of these tariffs that will avoid any negative economic consequences long term.\"\n\nTrump officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Broke Rollins, were confronted with his comments during Sunday morning news shows. They largely sidestepped the comments as they projected optimism about the policy's long term impact.\n\nSen.

Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, voiced similar concerns as Cruz.\n\n\"Tariffs are taxes and Americans are paying the price,\" Paul wrote on X last week.\n\nPaul also spoke on the Senate floor criticizing Trump's argument that the tariffs are necessary because of what he claimed was a \"national emergency\" regarding trade deficits. Paul said Congress needed to reassert its constitutional power to regulate tariffs and foreign trade.\n\n\"I am a Republican. I am a supporter of Donald Trump,\" Paul said. \"But this is a bipartisan problem. I don't care if the president is a Republican or a Democrat. I don't want to live under emergency rule. I don't want to live where my representatives cannot speak for me and have a check and balance on power.\"\n\n\"One person can make a mistake and guess what -- tariffs are a terrible mistake,\" Paul said.\n\nElon Musk looks on during a Cabinet Meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House Mar, 24, 2025 in Washington.

John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said last week.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced a bill last week that would require Congress to approve any new tariffs. Grassley teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell on the legislation.\n\nCantwell said on CBS News \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that seven Republicans were on board with the bill. Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told CBS he was \"beginning support\" for a similar measure in the House.\n\nBut the legislation faces an uphill battle, as it would need significant Republican support in both chambers to pass and Speaker Mike Johnson opposes the the idea.\n\nAnd so far, there are limited signs of any widespread cracks in overall support for Trump.\n\nSen. John Barrasso, a member of Republican leadership, said on Sunday that he believed Trump's actions on tariffs were constitutional.\n\n\"So, in terms of the tariffs, I believe they're a tool, and I think we have to go after China,\" Barrasso said on CBS. \"They have been abusing us for years, and I believe the President is on firm constitutional grounds.\"\n\nOn Monday, according to a White House statement sent to Senate Republicans and obtained by ABC News, Trump vowed to veto a bipartisan bill seeking to limit his authority to impose tariffs\n\n\"If passed, this bill would dangerously hamper the President's authority and duty to determine our foreign policy and protect our national security,\" the statement reads.\n\nHouse and Senate lawmakers are returning to Washington on Monday.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin and Jay O'Brien contributed to this report.",

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson and Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna say they have cut a deal to end the fight over proxy voting for new parents, which would reopen the House floor after nearly a week of legislative paralysis.\n\nBut a key Democrat who joined with Luna to press to make proxy voting available on Monday criticized the GOP-brokered deal as inadequate.\n\nHouse Republican leaders agree to formalize \"vote pairing,\" a procedure that would allow a member who is absent during a vote to coordinate with a present member on the other side of the matter to offset the absence, multiple sources familiar with the deal told ABC News.\n\nFor example, the procedure in this case would allow a new mother, who is absent for a House vote, to team up with a present lawmaker voting opposite from their stance to form a \"pair.\"\n\nSome logistics of this deal remain unclear including how this will be enforced.\n\nVote pairing -- a rare practice in Congress -- is certainly not an equivalent to remote voting but allows for an absence to be offset. But the absent member's vote is not recorded into the tally of a recorded vote.\n\nThe vote pairing process was used in 2018 when the Senate voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. At the time, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who said she would vote against Kavanaugh, paired her vote with Sen. Steve Daines' of Montana so their votes would cancel out.\n\nU.S. Speaker of the House Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) (L) participates in a ceremonial swearing-in with Rep.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nJohnson laid out the specifics of the agreement on a GOP member conference call Sunday afternoon, sources said.\n\nIn light of the deal, sources said Luna will not trigger her bipartisan discharge petition -- which has 218 signatures -- to allow mothers and fathers to vote remotely for up to 12 weeks after childbirth.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson and I have reached an agreement and are formalizing a procedure called 'live/dead pairing'—dating back to the 1800s—for the entire conference to use when unable to physically be present to vote: new parents, bereaved, emergencies,\" Rep. Luna posted in a statement on X.\n\nLuna thanked President Donald Trump for his \"support\" of new mothers. \"If we truly want a pro-family Congress, these are the changes that need to happen,\" she added.\n\nIt is possible for other members -- including any Democrat who signed the petition -- to call up and force action on Luna's measure. But it would likely fail if Republicans stick to the vote pairing agreement.\n\nJohnson is still looking at ways to increase accessibility for new mothers in Congress like adding a room off the House floor for nursing mothers, sources said.\n\nHouse Democrats, meanwhile, who locked arms with Luna last week, on Monday criticized the agreement Republicans reached -- maintaining that it \"fails to provide real solutions\" for lawmakers who are new parents.\n\nRep. Brittany Pettersen said she is \"grateful\" to Luna for championing the issue that matters \"but the reality is -- this outcome does not address the barriers we've fought so hard to overcome.\"\n\nThe blowback likely signals an uphill climb for Luna and Republicans to identify Democrats to offset a GOP absence -- creating an impractical path forward for lawmakers under the \"pairing\" scheme.\n\n\"Instead of letting us vote, he has instead gone to historic lengths to kill our resolution and make sure the large majority of his Members don't have a voice,\" Pettersen, D-Colo., wrote in a statement Monday afternoon. \"Let's be clear: these changes are not a win for us and Speaker Johnson has turned his back on moms and dads in Congress and working families.\"\n\nPettersen says the fight is \"far from over,\" while Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., agreed that the deal \"falls short\" of their goal -- though she also pledged to \"keep pushing.\"\n\n\"I won't accept the way Congress has always done things, and the American people won't either,\" Jacobs stated. \"We will keep pushing for innovative ways to support young people and parents in Congress – including by modernizing how we vote – even if it takes a Democratic majority to do so.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also refused to endorse the pairing gambit -- signaling he'd take first take the temperature of his caucus members who have led the discussion before publicly commenting.",

In imposing these tariffs, President Trump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives the the president power to regulate international commerce in the event of a national emergency.\n\nBut the IEEPA -- which specifically cites the power to impose sanctions and seize foreign assets -- does not mention tariffs. And, even if one argues the right to impose tariffs is implied, it's not clear what \"national emergency\" could justify the imposition of global tariffs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to reporters while in flight en route to Miami, April 3, 2025. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"There is a strong argument that the tariffs imposed under the IEEPA are not legal or constitutional,\" a prominent conservative lawyer close to President Trump told ABC News. \"Under that particular statute, tariffs are not listed amongst the various actions a president can take in response to the declaration of a nation emergency.\"\n\nThe lawyer adds: \"And when you combine that with the fact that Article 1, Section 8 [of the Constitution] clearly gives Congress the power to impose duties -- tariffs -- I think those two things in combination raise a very, very serious legal question.\"\n\nAnother conservative lawyer familiar with the expected legal challenge to Trump's tariffs predicted the Supreme Court would rule 9-0 against the administration if it reaches the high court.\n\nA lawsuit has already been filed against the 20% sanctions Trump imposed on China earlier this year. The White House cited the IEEPA in imposing those tariffs as well, and the president said they were in response to China's failure to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States.\n\nThe suit was filed in a federal court in Florida last week by The New Civil Liberties Alliance, a conservative legal, on behalf of a Florida-based paper company called Simplified.\n\nTrump's tariffs are the first time a president has attempted to impose global tariffs by citing the IEEPA. The steel and aluminum tariffs Trump imposed on China during his first term where narrower and done under a different congressional authorization. But that act doesn’t specifically give the president the authority to impose tariffs -- and it’s not clear what the emergency is that would justify his actions under the law.\n\nTariffs have never previously been imposed under the emergency power Trump is using here. The tariffs he imposed in his first term (and President Joe Biden's tariffs, too) were imposed citing different congressional authorizations.",

Kelly Morrison of Minnesota, has also called for exclusions on tariffs of children's products they called \"necessities,\" such as kids' furniture like high chairs and cribs and safety products such as car seats, which are mandated in all 50 states. The lawmakers issued a letter to Trump's administration on April 1 and pointed to past tariff exclusions for such products seven years ago.\n\n\"Notably, the first Trump Administration has previously recognized the necessity of excluding baby safety products from tariffs, when the United States Trade Representative exempted some of these goods from Section 301 tariffs in 2018,\" the letter said in part. \"We hope that the Administration will take to heart its promise to lower costs for American families by taking similar action to exempt these products from its blanket tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China and invest in American-made baby safety products.\"\n\nTariffs and impact on toys\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to toys, the Toy Association, a leading nonprofit representing the U.S. toy industry, told \"Good Morning America\" about 80% of toys come from China and that the association is calling for zero tariffs on toys, which they call \"essential products\" for children.\n\n\"Toys are essential products for childhood development and early education, and our industry works tirelessly to ensure these products remain safe and accessible,\" Kathrin Belliveau, a chief policy officer at The Toy Association, said in a statement . \"Working with toy associations around the world, we are reaffirming our aspiration for toys to remain tariff-free globally.\"\n\nABC News has reached out to the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture for comment.",

That “means being clear that we are in a strong position — America is in a position of weakness.”\n\nChina, which hit back Friday at Washington with 34% tariffs on U.S. products and other retaliatory moves, accused the U.S. of failing to play fair.\n\n“Putting ‘America First’ over international rules is a typical act of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying,” Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters.\n\nThe ruling Communist Party struck a note of confidence even as markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai crumpled. “The sky won't fall,” declared The People’s Daily, the party's official mouthpiece. “Faced with the indiscriminate punches of U.S. taxes, we know what we are doing and we have tools at our disposal.”\n\nLeading big drops in many markets, Hong Kong’s stock benchmark, the Hang Seng, plunged 13.2%. The Shanghai Composite index, meanwhile, lost 7.3% despite reported moves by regulators to staunch the losses.\n\nChina’s Commerce Ministry said officials met with representatives of 20 American businesses including Tesla and GE Healthcare over the weekend and urged them to take “concrete actions” to address the tariffs issue.\n\nDuring the meeting, Ling Ji, a vice minister of commerce, promised that China will remain open to foreign investment, according to the readout by the ministry.\n\nSouth Korea’s Trade Ministry said its top negotiator, Inkyo Cheong, will visit Washington this week to express Seoul’s concerns over the 25% tariffs on Korean goods and discuss ways to mitigate the damage to South Korean businesses, which include major automakers and steel makers.\n\nPakistan also planned to send a delegation to Washington this month to try negotiate over the 29% tariffs on its exports to the U.S., officials said. The prime minister ordered Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to assess the tariff's potential impact on Pakistan's fragile economy and draw up recommendations.\n\nThe U.S. imports around $5 billion worth of textiles and other products each year from Pakistan, which heavily relies on loans from the International Monetary Fund and other lenders.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, Malaysia’s Trade Minister Zafrul Abdul Aziz said his country will seek to forge a united response from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\nAs chair of the 10-nation body this year, Malaysia will lead a meeting Thursday in its capital Kuala Lumpur to discuss broader implications of the trade war on regional trade and investment, Zafrul told reporters.\n\n“We are looking at the investment flows, macroeconomic stability and ASEAN's coordinated response to this tariff issue,” Zafrul said. He denied reports Malaysia had imposed a 47% tariff on imports from the U.S., saying the actual average Malaysian tariff on American exports is 5.6%.\n\nHe said that he had met with the U.S. ambassador to Malaysia to try to clarify how the U.S. came up with its 24% tariff.\n\nIndonesia, one of the region's biggest economies, said it would work with businesses to increase its imports of U.S. wheat, cotton, oil and gas to help reduce its trade surplus, which was $18 billion in 2024.\n\nCoordinating Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto told a news conference that Indonesia will not retaliate against the new 32% tariff on Indonesian exports, but would use diplomacy to seek mutually beneficial solutions.\n\nSome Southeast Asian neighbors, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, face tariffs of over 40%, giving Indonesia a slight advantage, he noted.\n\n“For Indonesia, it is also another opportunity as its market is huge in America,” Hartoto said. He said Indonesia would buy U.S.-made components for several national strategic projects, including refineries.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists from around the world contributed to this report.",

However, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later confirmed the meeting in a post on X, in which he said that the \"indirect high-level talks\" on April 12 would take place in Oman.\n\n“It is as much an opportunity as it is a test,” Araghchi said in the post.\n\n\"If the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger,\" Trump said. \"And I hate to say it, great danger, because they can't have a nuclear weapon.

    "title": "In conservative Alabama, Republicans cheering for Trump - with some quiet concerns",
    "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
    "content": "Alabama Republicans cheered President Donald Trump and his agenda at a GOP party the day he imposed tariffs and sent stock markets tumbling worldwide\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- On a day when stock markets around the world dropped precipitously, Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl led a celebration of the president whose global tariffs sparked the sell-off.\n\nWith no mention of the Wall Street roller coaster and global economic uncertainty, Wahl declared his state GOP’s “Trump Victory Dinner” — and the broader national moment — a triumph. And for anyone who rejects President Donald Trump, his agenda and the “America First” army that backs it all, Wahl had an offer: “The Alabama Republican Party will buy them a plane ticket to any country in the world they want to go to.”\n\nWahl's audience — an assembly of lobbyists and donors, state lawmakers, local party officials and grassroots activists — laughed, applauded and sometimes roared throughout last week's gala in downtown Birmingham, the rare Democratic stronghold in one of the nation’s most Republican states. The president’s son Donald Trump Jr. elicited perhaps the most enthusiasm with an unapologetically partisan pitch, even repeating the lie that his father won the 2020 election over Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nYet beyond the cheerleading, there were signs of a more cautious optimism and some worried whispers over Trump’s sweeping tariffs, the particulars of his deportation policy and the aggressive slashing by his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Trump or Republicans are in danger of losing their grip in Alabama, where the GOP holds all statewide offices, dominates the Legislature and has won every presidential electoral vote since 1980. But it’s a notable wrinkle in a place where there's long been tension between relying on the federal government for funding and jobs, and an embrace of the kind of anti-Washington, anti-establishment populism that has twice propelled Trump to the Oval Office. And any cracks for Trump in Alabama — where he got 65% of the vote in 2024 — could portend trouble elsewhere, as the effects of a seismic shift in U.S. policy reach across the economy and society.\n\n“There are some concerns, some conversations,” said John Merrill, a former secretary of state, over just what Trump’s agenda will mean on the ground. Alabama, he acknowledged, has “been a net recipient” of the very federal government and economic model Trump is upending, meaning it receives more money back from Washington than its taxpayers send the federal government.\n\n“It’s a big risk,” said Merrill, who sported a Trump 45-47 pin on his lapel, a nod to the president's two terms.\n\nBlocks to the south of the complex where Republicans convened sits the multibillion-dollar University of Alabama at Birmingham health system, a regional gem where research depends on grants from the National Institutes of Health.\n\nRepublican Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, listed as a “Silver Sponsor” of the gala, didn't join the Democratic attorneys general suing the Trump administration to stop the cancellation of certain research funding streams Congress already has approved.\n\nMost of the medical services provided at UAB and many other hospitals throughout the state are covered by Medicare and Medicaid, two of the largest federal outlays. Alabama, because its per-capita income ranks among the lower tier among states, has one of the most generous federal match rates for Medicaid funding.\n\nA short drive west toward Tuscaloosa sits a gargantuan Mercedes-Benz complex, one of the earliest examples of foreign auto manufacturers coming to the American South, where state laws are hostile to organized labor. The plants have provided jobs at wages higher than the local norms but in some cases lower than in union shops of the Great Lakes region around Detroit. Many suppliers have followed in the South, but not so many that the assembly plants don’t still import many parts that now will be subject to Trump’s tariffs.\n\nTerry Martin, a county GOP committeeman in Tallapoosa County, said he supports the tariffs as leverage. Trump has “something to bargain with,” Martin said. But, “the parts that are coming from overseas … it’s going to pop it up” in price, he said, at least in the short term.\n\nAgriculture, meanwhile, is still a dominant Alabama industry. Meat processing plants in the North and row crop farms in the South depend on migrant labor that Merrill, the former secretary of state, said involves workers who are in the U.S. both legally and illegally. Alabama, he recalled, passed its own strict immigration bill during Barack Obama's presidency only to roll it back after industry leaders complained of a depleted workforce.\n\nWahl, in an interview after the gala, took a more nuanced approach than he did at the podium.\n\n“It is possible to secure our border and still take into account migrants who deserve to be here,” he said. “This has to be a two-pronged approach.”\n\nBack in Birmingham, Interstate 65 splits the city. The aging, increasingly congested artery is a local priority for widening. The proposal has support from Alabama's two Republican senators, Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt. U.S. interstate projects, though, are typically a 90-10 split, meaning 90% of the money comes from Washington, 10% from the state.\n\nThat funding — along with money for schools, Medicaid and other areas — could be at risk with Trump adviser Elon Musk and DOGE carrying Trump’s blessing to slash spending. GOP lawmakers who control Congress have supported Trump's agenda, which also includes dismantling the Education Department.\n\nTallapoosa County GOP Chair Denise Bates said “absolutely” there's a possibility DOGE could go too far. “I hope there are guardrails,” she said, noting she was once a local school board member.\n\n“Am I 100% for getting rid of the Department of Education? I can’t say that I am,” she said, adding a phrase similar to Merrill’s description of the state as a whole. “You know, we’re a net receiver.”\n\nYet for all the caveats offered in one-on-one conversations, the GOP crowd cheered when Tuberville, the former football coach turned Trump acolyte on Capitol Hill, offered a plainspoken defense of Musk and his pop-up agency, telling the crowd, “We're dead broke.” And they roared as he addressed tariffs.\n\n“It's past time we level the playing field and tell the rest of the world to get off their ass and start paying their fair share,” Tuberville said.\n\nBates argued that Alabama's embrace of Trump's “America First” push is not simply loyalty to the president. She said it reflects generations of voters watching the steel industry decline in Birmingham and, after the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted in 1994, the textile industry leaving for Mexico and, eventually, Southeast Asia.\n\n“We just want jobs,” she said.\n\nStill, state Sen. Jabo Waggoner, the longest-serving member of the Alabama Legislature, made clear Trump's visceral appeal, declaring him “the most popular president here since Ronald Reagan, hands down.”\n\nWahl recalled Trump’s first massive outdoor rally as a presidential candidate: 30,000 people at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama, in August 2015.\n\nWahl, who owns a butterfly farm outside Huntsville, said perhaps the best way to understand Trump and Alabama and this moment of uncertainty is to see a president who, at least to his supporters in the state, has earned the benefit of the doubt.\n\n“He’s going to let everybody know he’s serious,” the chairman said. Trump is “going to bring people to the bargaining table. We’re actually going to see the negotiator conduct business.”",

(AP Photo/Jason Redmond)\n\nMicrosoft has fired two employees who interrupted the company's 50th anniversary celebration to protest its work supplying artificial intelligence technology to the Israeli military, according to a group representing the workers.\n\nMicrosoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.\n\nThe protests began Friday when Microsoft software engineer Ibtihal Aboussad walked up to a stage where an executive was announcing new product features and a long-term vision for Microsoft's AI ambitions.\n\n“You claim that you care about using AI for good but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military,\" Aboussad shouted at Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. \"Fifty-thousand people have died and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region.”\n\nThe protest forced Suleyman to pause his talk, which was livestreamed from Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington. Among the participants at the 50th anniversary of Microsoft's founding were co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer.\n\n“Thank you for your protest, I hear you,” Suleyman said. Aboussad continued, shouting that Suleyman and “all of Microsoft” had blood on their hands. She also threw onto the stage a keffiyeh scarf, which has become a symbol of support for Palestinian people, before being escorted out of the event.\n\nA second protester, Microsoft employee Vaniya Agrawal, interrupted a later part of the event.\n\nAboussad was invited on Monday to a video call with a human resources representative at which she was told she was being terminated immediately. Agrawal was notified over email, according to the advocacy group No Azure for Apartheid, which has protested the sale of Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform to Israel.\n\nAn investigation by The Associated Press revealed earlier this year that AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI had been used as part of an Israeli military program to select bombing targets during the recent wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The story also contained details of an errant Israeli airstrike in 2023 that struck a vehicle carrying members of a Lebanese family, killing three young girls and their grandmother.\n\nIn February, five Microsoft employees were ejected from a meeting with CEO Satya Nadella for protesting the contracts.\n\n“We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard,” said a statement from the company Friday. “Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate. We are committed to ensuring our business practices uphold the highest standards.”\n\nMicrosoft had declined to say Friday whether it was taking further action. Aboussad told the AP she lost access to her work accounts shortly after the protest and had not been able to log back in.\n\nDozens of Google workers were fired last year after internal protests surrounding a contract that the technology company has with the Israeli government. Employee sit-ins at Google offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California were targeting a $1.2 billion deal known as Project Nimbus providing AI technology to the Israeli government.\n\nThe Google workers later filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board in an attempt to get their jobs back.",

The remarks came during a video conference interview with Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister.\n\nEarlier that day, Musk sharply criticized tariff-advocate Peter Navarro, Trump’s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing.\n\n“A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,” Musk said about Navarro in a post on X.\n\nThe latest reversal came from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jaime Dimon, who released a letter to investors on Monday warning that Trump’s tariffs would raise prices and possibly tip the U.S. into a recession.\n\n“Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” Dimon said.\n\nAs recently as January, however, Dimon voiced support for then-President-elect Trump’s tariff proposal and rebuked concerns about potential price increases.\n\n“If it’s a little inflationary but it’s good for national security, so be it,” Dimon told CNBC. “I mean, get over it.”\n\nDimon, who did not endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, praised Trump’s policies at the outset of last year.\n\n“He was kind of right about NATO, kind of right on immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Trade tax reform worked. He was right about some of China,” Dimon told CNBC.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt listens, as President Donald Trump speaks to reporters while in flight on Air Force One, en route to Joint Base Andrews on April 6, 2025. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA market selloff on Monday extended losses that stretch back to Trump's announcement of the far-reaching tariffs last week. The Dow suffered its worst week since 2020, and the Nasdaq ended last week in a bear market.\n\nThe new tariffs feature two key policies: A uniform 10% tariff for all imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs imposed on roughly 60 nations that place duties on U.S. imports.\n\nTrump has sent mixed signals about his willingness to negotiate with the target nations over the tariff levels.\n\n\"Countries from all over the World are talking to us,\" Trump said Monday on Truth Social. \"Tough but fair parameters are being set.\"\n\nSoon afterward, however, Trump threatened to slap an additional 50% tariff on China, unless the country withdraws 34% retaliatory tariffs announced last week.\n\nThose retaliatory tariffs came in response to a 34% tariff announced by the U.S. days earlier, which came on top of 20% tariffs already imposed on China. The threatened 50% tariff would bring total U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104%.\n\nOver the weekend, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller appeared to shift his posture toward Trump’s economic policies.\n\n“I do not support tariffs exceeding 10%,” Druckenmiller said in a post on X on Sunday.\n\nLess than three months earlier, Druckenmiller said CEOs were “giddy” about Trump’s election victory.\n\n“We’re probably going from the most anti-business administration to the opposite,” Druckenmiller added.",

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump welcomed Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and the reigning champion Los Angeles Dodgers to the White House on Monday to congratulate them for winning the World Series last season.\n\nTrump complimented “the very talented people” who beat the New York Yankees in five games, while also refusing to introduce some Democratic senators at the ceremony because “I just don’t particularly like them, so I won’t introduce (them).” The event came during a manic Monday for U.S. stocks after Trump doubled down on his tariffs.\n\nTrump singled out several Dodgers for their achievements last season, praising Ohtani for becoming baseball's first 50 home run-50 stolen base player, Japanese pitcher Yoshi Yamamoto and NL Championship Series MVP Tommy Edman.\n\nTrump praised Betts for his play — and took a dig at the Boston Red Sox for trading him to the Dodgers — and they shook hands at the ceremony.\n\nBetts, the star outfielder at the time for the 2018 champion Boston Red Sox, did not make that team’s trip to the White House the next year during Trump's first term. Betts was on the Dodgers when they won the World Series in 2020 and attended the celebration the following year under President Joe Biden.\n\nThe 32-year-old Betts is the lone Black player on the Dodgers who returned from last season’s World Series team.\n\n“Nobody else in this clubhouse has to go through a decision like this except me,” Betts said over the weekend of his decision. “That’s what makes it tough. But it is what it is. I’m not trying to make this political by any means at all. All it is is just me being with my team to celebrate something. It’s a privilege to get an invitation like this. I just want to be there with them.”\n\nManager Dave Roberts had called the invitation a huge honor that each World Series champion gets to experience. Roberts said deciding to go to the White House was not a formal conversation he and players had.\n\nThe trip came almost a month after a Department of Defense webpage describing Brooklyn Dodgers great and civil rights icon Jackie Robinson’s military service was restored after it had come down.\n\nThat development came after pages honoring a Black Medal of Honor winner and Japanese American service members were taken down — which the Pentagon said was a mistake — amid the department’s effort to remove content singling out the contributions by women and minority groups, which the Trump administration considers “DEI.”\n\nNeither Robinson nor any other previous Dodgers greats were mentioned at the ceremony.\n\nTrump did talk briefly about former New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, whom the former New Yorker called a friend. Trump also poked fun at the late Yankees owner's notorious short-leash with his managers after he congratulated Roberts.\n\n“I think he would have lasted even with George Steinbrenner,” Trump said. “You lose two games and you're fired.”\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers co-owner Mark Walter and pitcher Clayton Kershaw gave brief remarks at the White House. Kershaw presented Trump with a Dodgers jersey and No. 47 on the back.\n\nTrump may have tipped his hand that he expected the Dodgers — who were 9-2 going into Monday night's game at Washington — to repeat as World Series champs.\n\n“After seeing how successful you've begun the season, I can tell you that you can plan on being back here, I hope you can be back here, next year,” Trump said.\n\nThe NHL’s reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers became the first team to visit Trump in his second term when they were honored during a ceremony in the East Room in early February.\n\nThe White House also said recently the NFL’s Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles accepted their invitation for April 28.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

Amid confusion, he says it can be both.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House, April 7, 2025, in Washington.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House, April 7, 2025, in Washington.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House, April 7, 2025, in Washington.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House, April 7, 2025, in Washington.\n\nAmid mixed messaging from top White House officials, President Donald Trump was asked directly on Monday whether his sweeping tariffs are negotiable or here to stay.\n\n\"They can both be true,\" Trump responded. \"There can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations because there are things that we need beyond tariffs.\"\n\nFor days, from Trump on down, administration officials have offered conflicting statements on whether countries can do anything to save themselves from the tariffs, which include a universal 10% tariff implemented over the weekend and what they claimed were more targeted \"reciprocal\" tariffs to take effect on Wednesday.\n\nOn Monday alone, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent shared he was tasked with negotiating with Japan while White House trade advisor Peter Navarro penned an editorial that the new policies are \"not a negotiation.\"\n\nBessent posted on social media that following a \"very constructive phone discussion\" with Japanese officials, Trump instructed him and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to \"open negotiations to implement the President's vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade.\"\n\nNavarro wrote in the Financial Times that Trump wouldn't be backing down from his \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations the administration's deemed the worst offenders in trade relations.\n\n\"This is about fairness, and no one can argue with that. This is not a negotiation,\" Navarro wrote. \"For the US, it is a national emergency triggered by trade deficits caused by a rigged system. President Trump is always willing to listen. But to those world leaders who, after decades of cheating, are suddenly offering to lower tariffs -- know this: that's just the beginning.\"\n\nWhen Trump announced the sweeping tariffs in the White House Rose Garden, he justified them as a response to a \"national emergency\" caused by trade deficits and unfair practices with global partners.\n\nPresident Donald Trump takes a question from a member of the media during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House, April 7, 2025 in Washington. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nSince then, markets at home and abroad slumped. Foreign leaders recoiled, with some -- like China -- taking retaliatory action against the United States. Economists increased their odds of a recession this year.\n\nOfficials were pressed to justify the action on Sunday morning news shows, where again the confused messaging was apparent. Trump spent the weekend golfing as fallout from his tariff policy continued.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, on the CBS News program \"Face the Nation,\" said tariffs were going to \"stay in place for days and weeks\" and that \"this is the policy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, on ABC News' \"This Week,\" boasted that 50 countries had reached out to the White House to negotiate tariffs.\n\nTrump on Monday said they're open to \"fair deals\" with foreign leaders that put \"America first\" -- but that tariffs would stay in place in the meantime.\n\n\"We're going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don't, we're going to have nothing to do with them. They're not going to be allowed to participate in the United States,\" he said.\n\nABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked Trump on Monday if he'd be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiation.\n\n\"Well, we're not looking at that,\" Trump responded. \"We have many, many, countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals. And in certain cases, they're going to be paying substantial tariffs.\"\n\nA rumor of a possible 90-day tariff pause that circulated on Monday caused stocks to briefly spike into green territory before going back into the red when the White House denied the report.\n\nTrump said in the Oval Office that he doesn't \"mind going through it,\" seemingly a nod to the criticism and volatility of the market because he believes it's worth it at the end of the day.\n\n\"So, it's got to be very interesting,\" he said. \"It's the only chance our country will have to reset the table because no other president would be willing to do what I'm doing or to even go through it. Now, I don't mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end.\"\n\nABC News' Michelle Stoddart contributed to this report.",

    "source": "https://abcnews.go.com/",
    "content": "A contract to inspect low-income and other assisted housing for gas leaks, faulty smoke detectors and other life-threatening deficiencies was terminated by the Trump administration in February as part of its cost-cutting efforts, according to a Department of Government Efficiency database, potentially leaving thousands of vulnerable Americans in harm's way.\n\nTom Feehan, a veteran home inspector who lost work as part of the termination, told ABC News that these legally required inspections frequently uncover painted-over ceiling sprinklers, defective gas ranges and any number of home-related liabilities that can pose a danger to occupants.\n\n\"By not doing [the inspections], we're not catching those,\" Feehan said. \"So those are not being repaired, and it's putting people at risk.\"\n\nLast year, the contractor, Project Solutions Inc., in its third year of working with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, was assigned to inspect roughly 6,200 public housing and multifamily properties across the country over the course of 12 months. In addition to flagging dangerous conditions, the inspections ensure that tenants have hot and cold water, safe electrical outlets, and working heating and cooling systems, experts said.\n\nA HUD official told ABC News that the contract was for \"software modification,\" despite Project Solutions identifying the contract as being for inspection services. The HUD official declined to elaborate on the reason behind the contract's termination.\n\nThe sudden termination threatens thousands of inspections, according to Robin Miller, a contract manager at Project Solutions, including those at roughly 250 \"priority\" properties, where inspections were already delayed or significant deficiencies were found during previous inspections.\n\nProject Solution's contract termination was among more than 7,000 federal contracts canceled by DOGE and posted to the agency's \"Wall of Receipts\" web page in recent weeks. The DOGE site claimed that terminating the inspection contract would return $285 million to taxpayers.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development building in Washington, D.C. March 19, 2025. Annabelle Gordon/Sipa USA via AP\n\nBut Miller, the Project Solutions official, said that figure was inflated because it was based on a high estimated ceiling value that wasn't reflective of what the contract would actually cost. According to federal spending records, HUD had only awarded Project Solutions roughly $29 million so far.\n\nExperts said it was unclear how housing officials planned to carry out the outstanding inspections.\n\nHUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said in a statement that \"HUD is reviewing all contracts for efficiency and effectiveness to accomplish good government goals,\" and that \"certain contracts were found not to accomplish HUD's mission with economy, efficiency, and effectiveness.\"\n\nIndustry experts said that the inspections, which are required by law, will likely fall to other contractors at a similar price. But arranging those inspections will take time, experts said, and delaying inspections compounds the risks for tenants.\n\n\"We're helping low-income people and we're helping senior citizens maintain a safe, livable environment,\" Feehan said. \"And with not getting these inspections done on time, it's hurting them.\"\n\nAnother HUD-certified inspector based in Illinois, who asked that their name not be used so they could speak freely about their field of work, told ABC News that one of the properties that was scheduled to be inspected until the Project Solutions contract was canceled was a 24-unit multifamily property that had received far below the \"failing\" score, meaning significant deficiencies were found during its previous inspection and the property needed more frequent inspections. The property was already past due its Dec. 13, 2024, inspection date, and its inspection has yet to be rescheduled, the inspector said.\n\nProject Solutions was one of at least three contractors that were hired to inspect HUD-insured and assisted properties under the agency's Real Estate Assessment Center program, which is aimed at \"improving housing quality by performing accurate, credible, and reliable assessments\" of its properties.\n\n\"I 100% agree that all governments, all organizations, businesses, even personal family units, should routinely review budget and spending habits and cut things out that are not necessary,\" the Illinois inspector said. \"Get rid of the fraud, waste abuse -- but you have to be responsible about it.\"\n\n\"If it wasn't for DOGE, we'd still be doing the contract. That's my opinion,\" Feehan said. \"DOGE is trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse. I didn't see where there was waste fraud and abuse with PSI.\"\n\nAlia Trindle, co-director of political strategy at housing advocacy group Right to the City Alliance, stressed that many HUD-funded buildings have been in dire shape for decades due to past funding cuts. She said for some properties, tenants and advocates have had to organize to push for basic repairs after years of neglect.\n\n\"Working-class and poor communities have to contend with substandard and neglected housing that could have devastating long-term health consequences for those that live there, from mold to pest to a lack of access to basic utilities like water and heat,\" Trindle said.\n\n\"So regular inspections, whether done by HUD or HUD-affiliated groups or by municipalities, are critical to ensuring that those who are responsible for this housing stock do the bare minimum to maintain them,\" she said.\n\nABC News' Gabrielle Vinick contributed to this report.",

Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n\nIn a statement, a Treasury Department spokesperson said, “Staffing reductions that are currently being considered at the IRS will be part of -- and driven by -- process improvements and technological innovations that will allow the IRS to collect revenue and serve taxpayers more effectively. The roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service. The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve.”\n\nThe email sent to IRS employees Friday said the reduction in force will \"be implemented in phases\" and noted that employees will be offered early retirement incentives starting next week.\n\nThe agency also recently put approximately 50 IT security staffers on administrative leave, according to people familiar with the move, as the agency faces pressure to make workforce cuts and demands for data-sharing across the federal government during tax season. The Trump administration has said workforce changes will not affect staff directly working to process tax returns.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that the layoffs may still cause delays.\n\n\"The bottom line: Forever, it has been an absolute rule of thumb that you keep things stable during filing season.

Those retaliatory tariffs came in response to a 34% tariff announced by the U.S. days earlier, which came on top of 20% tariffs already imposed on China. The threatened 50% tariff would bring total U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104%.\n\nUltimately, the market continued to move lower on Monday.

She pleaded not guilty.\n\nRead's first trial ended in a mistrial last July after the jury deadlocked following five days of deliberations.\n\n\"Despite our rigorous efforts we find ourselves at an impasse,\" Judge Beverly Cannone said, reading a note from the jury. \"The deep division is not due to lack of consideration but to a severe adherence to our personal beliefs and moral compasses.

    "content": "A judge had ruled that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia must be returned to the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has issued a temporary administrative stay -- putting off a midnight deadline for the government to return a mistakenly deported Maryland man to the U.S. -- giving the court more time to consider the arguments presented by both sides.\n\nThe Trump administration had asked the Supreme Court for emergency intervention in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who the government -- by its own admission -- removed to El Salvador by mistake.\n\nRoberts did not explain the decision. Administrative stays are not rulings on the merits in any way and do not indicate one way or the other how the court might eventually rule.\n\nThe Supreme Court requested a response to Trump's request from Garcia's attorneys by 5 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nThis undated photo provided by CASA, an immigrant advocacy organization, in April 2025, shows Kilmar Abrego Garcia. CASA via AP\n\nIn the filing earlier Monday, Trump administration Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that a federal court cannot order a president to engage in foreign diplomacy, which he says is implicitly involved in any potential return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who the Trump administration alleges is a gang member.\n\n\"The Constitution charges the President, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the Nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal,\" Sauer writes. \"And this order sets the United States up for failure. The United States cannot guarantee success in sensitive international negotiations in advance, least of all when a court imposes an absurdly compressed, mandatory deadline that vastly complicates the give-and-take of foreign-relations negotiations.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia, despite having protected legal status, was sent to the notorious CECOT mega-prison in El Salvador following what the government said was an \"administrative error.\"\n\nIn March, Abrego Garcia, whose wife is a U.S. citizen and who has 5-year-old child, was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who \"informed him that his immigration status had changed,\" according to his attorneys. He was detained and then transferred to a detention center in Texas before being sent to El Salvador.\n\nAbrego Garcia entered the United States in 2011 when he was 16 to escape gang violence in El Salvador, according to his lawyers. Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, the attorney representing Abrego Garcia, said last week his client is not a member of MS-13, as the government has alleged, but said that's an issue for an immigration judge to address.\n\nThe appeal to the Supreme Court came Monday morning, just before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reaffirmed Friday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis that Abrego Garcia must be returned by Monday at 11:59 p.m. ET.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House upon arrival in Washington, DC, April 6, 2025. Chris Kleponis/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Trump administration's emergency motion to block the order to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the panel of three judges agreed Xinis' order requiring the government \"to facilitate and effectuate the return of [Abrego Garcia] by the United States by no later than 11:59 pm on Monday, April 7, 2025,\" should not be stayed.\n\n\"The United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process,\" the judges said. \"The Government's contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable.\"\n\nU.S. Circuit Judge Jamie Wilkinson, who was appointed by Ronald Reagan, said in his opinion that \"there is no question that the government screwed up here.\"\n\n\"If it is truly a mistake, one would also expect the government to do what it can to rectify it,\" Wilkinson said. \"Most of us attempt to undo, to the extent that we can, the mistakes that we have made. But, to the best of my knowledge, the government has not made the attempt here.\"\n\nIn a concurring opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge Robert King and U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanie Thacker said if the government wanted to prove that the Maryland man who was sent to El Salvador was \"a prominent\" member of MS-13, they had \"ample opportunity to do so,\" but has not \"even bothered to try.\"\n\n\"The Government has made no effort to demonstrate that Abrego Garcia is, in fact, a member of any gang,\" said King and Thacker.",

    "content": "New Mexico's governor has signed a bill to create a “turquoise alert\" for missing Native Americans in New Mexico\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. -- New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation Monday to create a “turquoise alert\" for when Native Americans go missing in the state.\n\nThe effort — which had overwhelming support among lawmakers — responds to a troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country.\n\nThe “turquoise alert” system — taking its name from the blue-green mineral — will allow law enforcement to quickly share information. It will function much like “amber” and “silver” alerts that highlight the disappearance of children and the elderly. Cellphone alerts will be issued when law enforcement finds evidence of imminent danger in the disappearance of a Native American.\n\nThe legislation wasn't just a policy achievement, but a victory for every Native American mother, daughter, sister and aunt who has ever been impacted by violence, said Tiffany Jiron, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women.\n\n“This bill reflects our deep commitment to ensuring that no Indigenous person is left behind when they go missing,” Jirons said in a statement. “For far too long, Native women and girls have been overlooked, their cases ignored or delayed. The Turquoise Alert System is an essential step toward rectifying that injustice and ensuring that our people receive the protection they deserve.”\n\nCalifornia, Washington and Colorado have similar alert systems, according to the New Mexico Department of Indian Affairs. Arizona lawmakers are considering their own alert system as the brutal death of San Carlos Apache teenager Emily Pike reverberates through Native American communities.\n\nNew Mexico has 23 federally recognized tribes, including large portions of the Navajo Nation and land holdings of the Fort Sill Apache. The safety concerns of those communities were on prominent display during the 60-day legislative session that wrapped up in March.",

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Army has reenlisted more than 23 soldiers who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, officials said Monday, rushing to implement President Donald Trump's order that troops be rehired and given back pay.\n\nThree people rejoined active duty Army service, and more than 20 came back either to the National Guard or the Reserve, the Army said. The soldiers have signed their contracts and were sworn in, and the active duty troops were reporting to their units, the Army said.\n\nNone of the other services has completed reenlistments yet, but all are reaching out to former troops. The Marine Corps, Air Force, Army and Navy set up new websites on Monday to provide information for service members looking to reenlist. And they are sending letters and emails and making calls to those who were discharged.\n\nTrump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return. In an executive order signed a week after he took office, Trump said the vaccine mandate cost the military “some of our best people” and he vowed to “rehire every patriot who was fired from the military with … backpay.”\n\nThose who may have been attracted by the offer of back pay will likely get far less money than they initially thought when Trump announced his plan. Under the details of the Pentagon offer, any wages earned during their time as civilians would be deducted from the back pay total, along with other payments they may have received.\n\nThe Pentagon made the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in August 2021 for all service members, including those in the National Guard and Reserve. Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said getting the vaccine was critical to maintaining a healthy, ready force. The Pentagon dropped the mandate in January 2023.\n\nThe initial reenlistments come as the Pentagon last week formally increased the new minimum service commitment from two to four years for those discharged for refusing a lawful order to take the vaccine.\n\nA Feb. 7 memo sent to the secretaries of the military services said troops would be required to sign up for two years. But a memo signed April 1 by Jules Hurst III, who is doing the job of defense undersecretary for personnel, said “reinstatement will not be afforded to those who are unwilling or unable to return to active service or active status, as applicable, for four years.”\n\nThe Army said the bulk of the soldiers who reenlisted were those ordered out for refusing the shot, and they signed on for four years. They will be entitled to get some back pay. Several, however, left the Army voluntarily to avoid the shot, so they are allowed to reenlist for two years and will not get back pay.\n\nAccording to the new memo, there is an exception for anyone who would have been eligible for retirement within two years of the date they were originally discharged. Those service members also can reenlist for at least two years.\n\nRoughly 8,200 troops were discharged for refusing to obey the vaccine order. They have been allowed to rejoin since 2023, but that did not include any back pay. Just 113 reenlisted.\n\nThe Army and Marine Corps have been sending out emails, texts and phone calls to service members for several weeks. The Navy and the Air Force had been waiting for the additional guidance.\n\nAccording to Army spokesman Christopher Surridge, about 400 soldiers have inquired so far about the reenlistment program. Of those, about 100 are in the application process. The Army did not have estimates on how much it has given the soldiers in total back pay.\n\nAs of Friday, 472 Marines have indicated interest in learning more about returning. The Navy said about a half dozen sailors had so far expressed interest or sought more information, and the Air Force said it had not yet gotten any feedback from service members.\n\nThe limited interest reflects what service leaders said early on, which was that many troops used the vaccine as a reason to leave and have moved on with their lives.\n\nThose eligible for back pay could get an amount that includes their basic salary, bonus payments, cost-of-living allowances and some health benefit costs. But that total will be reduced by any wages, veterans benefits, separation payments, debts and other amounts that were earned during that time.\n\nService members will have to provide verified tax records and other paperwork as part of the process.\n\nAccording to the memo, the services must provide each person with an estimate of the amount of back pay they will receive. Service members will then have 60 days to decide whether to reenlist.\n\nEveryone who wants to reenlist must meet all military standards, including health, fitness and moral requirements. Service members have until Feb. 28, 2026, to seek reinstatement.",

    "content": "An Israeli strike on Monday hit next to a charity kitchen where Palestinians crowded to receive cooked meals as food supplies dwindle under Israel's month-long blockade of the Gaza Strip, one of a string of attacks in the territory that killed more than 30 people, mostly women and children, hospital officials said. Another strike hit a media tent outside a hospital, killing two people, including a local reporter, and wounding six other journalists, medics said. The Israeli military said the strike targeted a man whom it identified as a Hamas militant posing as a journalist.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nVideo footage showed people carrying the body of a little girl, her face covered with blood, from the blast that witnesses said hit a tent next to the charity kitchen outside the southern city of Khan Younis. Six other people were killed, including two women, and at least 10 people were wounded, hospital officials said. The strike hit around noon as the kitchen was distributing meals to displaced people living in tent camps. Samah Abu Jamie said her nephew was among those killed and her young daughter was wounded as they waited with their pots to collect meals for their families. “They were going to get food. I told her, ‘Daughter, don’t go',” she said. “These were children, and they had nothing with them but a pot. Is a pot a weapon?” There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike. 'Bombed and starved again' Charity kitchens have been drawing bigger crowds of Palestinians because other sources of food are running out. More than a month ago, Israeli cut off all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies for Gaza’s population of more than 2 million people, forcing aid groups to ration their stocks.\n\nThe World Food Program has warned that its supplies to keep kitchens going could be depleted by next week. It had to stop distributing boxes of food staples directly to families last week, spokesperson Abeer Etefa said Monday. The bakeries it ran have also shut down for lack of flour, ending a main source of bread for hundreds of thousands of people. Since it ended its ceasefire with Hamas last month, Israel has carried out bombardments across Gaza, killing hundreds of people, and ground forces have carved out new military zones. Israel says it is pressuring Hamas to free its remaining hostages, disarm and leave the territory. Under the ceasefire deal, it had agreed to negotiate for the hostages’ release. The heads of six U.N. agencies operating in Gaza said in a joint statement Monday that the blockade has left Gaza’s population “trapped, bombed and starved again.” They said Israeli claims that enough supplies entered during the ceasefire “are far from the reality on the ground, and commodities are running extremely low.”\n\n“We are witnessing acts of war in Gaza that show an utter disregard for human life,” they said. “Protect civilians. Facilitate aid. Release hostages. Renew a ceasefire.” Strikes hit journalists and homes The strike outside Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis about 2 a.m. set the media tent ablaze, killing Yousef al-Faqawi, a reporter for the Palestine Today news website, and another man, according to hospital officials. The military said the strike targeted Hassan Eslaiah, claiming he was a Hamas militant who took part in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that ignited the war. Eslaiah was among six journalists who were wounded in the strike, according to the hospital. Eslaiah had occasionally contributed images to The Associated Press and other international media outlets as a freelance journalist, including on Oct. 7. The AP has not worked with him for over a year. A strike that hit a street in Gaza City killed an emergency room doctor, the Gaza Health Ministry said. Israel’s campaign has killed more than 1,000 health workers and at least 173 journalists, according to the U.N. and the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nHospitals in Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah said they received the bodies of 33 people, 19 of them women and children, from strikes overnight and into the day on Monday, including those from the kitchen and the media tent attack. Some of the strike reduced houses to rubble. Imad Maghari said the blast that hit his neighbors in Deir al-Balah at 2 a.m. was like “an earthquake,” followed by the screams of women and children. He said one neighbor lost five family members and another a young boy. “I don’t know what danger he poses. He’s 7 years old,” Maghari said. Israel’s military offensive in retaliation for Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry, whose count does not distinguish between militants and civilians. The offensive has destroyed vast areas of the Gaza Strip and displaced around 90% of its population.\n\nIsrael says it tries to avoid civilian casualties and blames Hamas for their deaths because it operates among the population.\n\nIn the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people. They are still holding 59 captives — 24 of whom are believed to be alive — after most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals.\n\nProtests in Israel as Netanyahu meets Trump\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday to discuss Gaza and other issues.\n\nDozens of protesters gathered outside Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem to call for an agreement to release the captives. Many fear that Netanyahu’s decision to resume the fighting has put the remaining hostages in grave danger and hope Trump can help broker another deal.\n\n“Now the moment of truth has come,” said Varda Ben Baruch, grandmother of Israeli American hostage Edan Alexander, addressing Netanyahu. “You are in the United States and you have to sit there with President Trump and close a deal so that everyone will be released home.”",

We were close to deadline, the editors were deadlocked; when I sought refuge in D.W.’s office, he told me he thought I might decide I needed an alternative, and pulled out an entirely new cover image that he had commissioned overnight.

I never heard him raise his voice or get cross with anyone. He was a perfect collaborator because he did not have that ego-driven attachment to his own work. He was looking for the best image to illustrate the story. That’s powerful journalism. He tended to look at last-minute changes, or breaking news, as a fun challenge rather than a piece of bad luck. That’s a useful trait at a newsmagazine. As a culture, we tend to associate creativity with eccentricity or being temperamental. Not D.W.

    "title": "AI May Make it Even Harder to Find a Job",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "Entering 2025, underlying the calm surface of the U.S. labor market were currents of anxiety, dissatisfaction, and stagnation. Companies were taking longer to fill open roles, and a growing numbers of employees were disengaged but staying in their roles out of concern it would be difficult to find something better. Now, President Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and their Department of Government Efficiency have laid off thousands of federal employees. These workers are now re-entering the job market. Plus, companies and employees alike are trying to anticipate the impact of rollicking financial markets thanks to constant changes in tariffs. This economic tumult is bringing the stormy currents of the labor market to the surface.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the face of these challenges, many job seekers are turning to new AI-powered apps meant to help them find jobs. But ironically, these tools are likely to exacerbate the present challenges and make it harder, not easier, to find jobs. To understand why AI tools designed to help individuals apply to jobs will make the job market more challenging to navigate, it helps to understand the history of those tools and how companies actually hire people today. AI isn’t a new phenomenon in the job-application process. Its mainstream use began on the employer side when companies deployed AI-powered tools in the 2010s to filter through the hundreds of job applications they were receiving for open online job postings. The AI tools baked into these applicant tracking systems—software that companies use to manage the hiring process—looked for matches between the words on incoming resumes and those in job descriptions. If there was enough of a match, then a job seeker’s resume likely made it through the filter.\n\nOn its face, this seemed to offer an advantage to companies over job seekers. In reality, although companies did use these tools to winnow their hiring funnels, most actual hires weren’t made from the pool of people applying online without a connection to the hiring manager. Instead, despite the democratization of job postings online, estimates suggest that well over half of jobs—and perhaps as high as 85%—are still found through personal connections. This is due in no small part to a lack of trust that job seekers and companies have in each other when interacting online. Online job descriptions today have become a long list of skills, qualifications, and platitudes about work style and culture cribbed from past job descriptions, competitors’ postings, and requirements for pay and title grading at the desired level of the role. They have become so vague and meaningless that roles can be impossible to fill as described. Think of the myriad entry-level postings that call for “two years of experience,” for example. Or all the job descriptions that require college degrees—even when current employees in the same roles lack them. Indeed, if you peruse enough job postings, you sometimes get the feeling that employers are seeking employees who do not exist.\n\nSimultaneously, as AI-powered applicant tracking systems sort out individuals that don’t match the desired skills, experiences, and characteristics listed in these job descriptions, prospective employees have learned to embellish their resume and make themselves look like superheroes. In order to get past AI-powered gatekeepers, it has become common for applicants to exaggerate their experiences. This cycle has generated mistrust in the resumes and cover letters coming in from the internet. As a result, managers often prefer to source candidates through a referral they can trust from someone they know. Sure, that might mean it takes longer to fill open roles. But the delay can be worth it from a company’s perspective if it results in a better match. The consequence of this dynamic is that as job seekers begin using AI tools to apply to jobs online, it’s unlikely to help them. It’s actually likely to send the job market into an AI-driven hiring doom loop—the result of which will be employers relying on their personal networks for hiring even more.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by Canva, 45% of global job seekers use AI to create and fine-tune their resumes and cover letters. And a growing number of job seekers are doing something more radical: They are using AI-powered tools like LazyApply and JobCopilot to apply directly to open jobs on their behalf. But unfortunately, positive experiences with these AI-powered apps tend to be the exception, not the rule. As more job seekers leverage these automated application tools, it may become even more difficult for job seekers to find a job online because they will flood hiring managers with more applications than they could ever consider. Employers that were receiving hundreds of applications for open roles already tell us that they now receive thousands. With even less trust in the AI-tailored resumes pouring in, companies are likely to rely on personal connections even more to help them find employees.\n\nHiring processes that overly rely on personal connections creates problems—both for companies and job seekers. Companies seeking to boost the diversity of their funnel by gathering large numbers of applicants will likely continue to end up with new hires in similar social circles as their existing employees. Network-based hiring has downsides for job seekers as well. If getting a job is all about who you know, those with limited networks are often left out. As Harvard University’s Raj Chetty’s Opportunity Insights research has shown, networks are strongly based in class—particularly at the top. This means that individuals from low socio-economic backgrounds often have significantly fewer high-income connections. And given the number of jobs filled by who you know, that means that low-income Americans are less connected to higher paying opportunities in the workforce. If these personal connections become even more important when looking for a job, individuals must beef up their networks—not just on social media or with AI bots, but in real life.\n\nTo be sure, networking can “feel dirty,” but as AI makes the job search process more difficult, it will be increasingly critical. So what to do? Rather than connecting with a potential member of your network with the explicit goal of asking for a job, make a habit of being curious about the work other professionals do. Talk with people who hold roles that interest you to learn about what they do on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis. The focus, in other words, should be about learning and growth. Over time, you will expand your network and learn about the roles that are good fits for you, your unique skills and experience, and the types of work that energize you. The goal should be to become a self-aware individual who understands what opportunities are out there, recognizes what they bring to the table, and demonstrates real interest in others. That will, in turn, set you apart as someone worth recommending by those that others trust—which is something AI can’t do.\n\nMichael B.

    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "Chief Justice John Roberts agreed Monday to pause a midnight deadline for the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. The temporary order comes hours after a Justice Department emergency appeal to the Supreme Court arguing U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis overstepped her authority when she ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the United States. The administration has conceded that Abrego Garcia should not have been sent to El Salvador because an immigration judge found he likely would face persecution by local gangs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut he is no longer in U.S. custody and the government has no way to get him back, the administration argued. Xinis gave the administration until just before midnight to “facilitate and effectuate” Abrego Garcia’s return. “The district court’s injunction—which requires Abrego Garcia’s release from the custody of a foreign sovereign and return to the United States by midnight on Monday—is patently unlawful,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in court papers, casting the order as one in “a deluge of unlawful injunctions” judges have issued to slow President Donald Trump's agenda. The Justice Department appeal was directed to Roberts because he handles appeals from Maryland. The Trump administration is separately asking the Supreme Court to allow Trump to resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members to the same Salvadoran prison under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nThe federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, denied the administration's request for a stay. “There is no question that the government screwed up here,” Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote in a brief opinion accompanying the unanimous denial. The White House has described Abrego Garcia’s deportation as an “administrative error” but has also cast him an MS-13 gang member. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia said there is no evidence he was in MS-13. “The Executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,” Abrego Garcia’s lawyers wrote in a response filed moments after Roberts issued his temporary pause. Xinis wrote that the decision to arrest him and send him to El Salvador appears to be “wholly lawless,” explaining that little to no evidence supports a “vague, uncorroborated” allegation that Abrego Garcia was once an MS-13 member.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who has never been charged or convicted of any crime, was detained by immigration agents and deported last month.\n\nHe had a permit from DHS to legally work in the U.S. and was a sheet metal apprentice pursuing a journeyman license, his attorney said. His wife is a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn 2019, an immigration judge barred the U.S. from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.\n\nA Justice Department lawyer conceded in a court hearing that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported. Attorney General Pam Bondi later removed the lawyer, Erez Reuveni, from the case and placed him on leave.",

    "title": "The Rising Demand For Electricity Is About More than AI",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "How much will AI drive up power demand in the next few years? That’s been the big question at the center of the energy and climate conversation recently. Many analysts have warned that AI-driven electricity usage is expected to more than double in the next five years as consumers and businesses find varied applications for the technology. But others urge caution: not all data centers in the planning process will ultimately be built and AI could become much more energy efficient than it is today.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is a crucial debate—but the full picture is even more complicated. Even if AI guzzles less energy than the zeitgeist suggests, a wide range of electricity demand drivers lurk just around the corner. A report released earlier this week from the International Energy Agency (IEA) gives a sense of the picture: global electricity demand grew by 4.3% last year due to a range of causes that include not just data centers but also electrification of everything from building heating to cooking, along with more air conditioning thanks to record high temperatures, among other things. “We see one very clear trend: electricity growth,” says Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. Widening the aperture of the conversation around future power demand can help prevent us from fixating on a single technology (however transformative it might be), and avoid the risk of overlooking the complex interplay of factors that will shape our energy future—and the challenges and opportunities that will arise from it.\n\nTo understand the nature of electricity demand growth, it’s helpful to break it down by geography. And there’s no better place to start than in emerging markets and developing countries. Electricity demand ticked up 7% in China and by more than 4% in other emerging and developing economies; meanwhile, electricity consumption in the European Union grew by about 1.5%, according to the IEA. Some of that growth is the simple product of expanding economies. More wealth means more electricity use. But a significant portion of the rising demand came from high temperatures—particularly heat waves in India and China—that pushed consumers and businesses to crank up air conditioning. Electricity usage also grew in the U.S. by about 2% last year, according to government data. Unsurprisingly, the most significant source of that growth was new data centers, but other factors contributed, too. Federal programs enacted during the Biden Administration, like the Inflation Reduction Act, have helped boost the country’s advanced manufacturing footprint. That means a wave of new facilities drawing electricity in previously unoccupied land or revitalized vacant facilities. Moreover, today’s manufacturing plants rely more on electricity than they would have a generation ago, when they might have onsite power from fossil fuels.\n\nAnd then there are electric vehicles. Headlines would have you believe that EVs now face an insurmountable challenge in the U.S. market as people aren’t buying as many as expected. That may be true, but the IEA reports that sales actually continued to grow in the U.S. at greater than a 10% clip. In the coming years, increased EV penetration inevitably means greater power demand. There are a few lessons to draw from this story. For one, if you’re betting on an AI-efficiency breakthrough to save the world from an electricity crunch, you’re missing the bigger picture. Yes, we know a range of developments, like more energy efficient language models, could reduce AI’s future electricity demand, but that won’t address all of the other sources of demand. There are also some positive elements that emerge from this story. Most obviously, the IEA says that 80% of new electricity generation globally last year came from renewable energy or nuclear power. That dynamic means that emissions grew at a slower pace than the economy. “If we want to find the silver lining, we see that there is a continuous decoupling of economic growth from emissions growth,” says Birol.\n\nThat’s small consolation at a time when emissions need to not just slow down but actually decline in order to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change. But I see another opportunity that could emerge from this imminent power crunch: we may be forced to finally confront the full range of solutions available to us. Yes, power companies are eagerly trying to build natural gas to meet demand. But they’re building solar power and battery storage, too. And because neither will be enough, companies have rediscovered the value of nuclear power. In these circumstances, demand-reducing technologies like smart grids and demand response are already taking on newfound importance and companies are incentivized to find more energy efficient ways to run their business. That importance should only grow.\n\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.",

    "title": "Gabby Thomas’ Life Is About Much More Than Olympic Medals",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\n\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\n\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\n\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\n\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\n\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\n\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”",

    "title": "Why Nicole Kidman Never Stops Working",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "In the days after giving birth, Nicole Kidman found herself unable to breastfeed. “I was so terrified, asking, What just happened? Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\n\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\n\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\n\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\n\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\n\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\n\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\n\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\n\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\n\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\n\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\n\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\n\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\n\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\n\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\n\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\n\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances.

    "content": "I wake up from the anesthesia and a black tide washes over me. The world seeps slowly back. A hospital room. The face of a doctor and two nurses mouthing something I can't understand. This is not the first time I've woken up from surgery. The first ones I had gave me my cochlear implants. The last one I had gave me my chest scars. This time, seven new bolts of metal have been added to my left arm—I took a fall while bike training for an upcoming ride this summer with a deaf bike group from San Francisco to LA in support of the San Francisco AIDs Foundation and the Los Angeles LGBT Center.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMy best friend pushes open the door and walks toward me, her eyes soft. Gazing at her with heavy lids, I allow myself to fall apart. Anesthesia, I later learned, has a way of bringing your subconscious, deepest thoughts to the surface. “I’m having such scary thoughts,” I keep saying, over and over, between sobs. “You know how I can’t ever seem to imagine my future…” I hesitated. Saying it out loud would make it real. \"It’s clear now that I was never planning to kill myself,\" I admitted. \"I thought someone else was going to.\"\n\nChella Man is choosing deaf trans joy without conditions.\n\nWe exhaled together. Her expression remained unchanged, like she already knew something I was only now beginning to realize myself.\n\nGrowing up in rural Pennsylvania, I spent so many years being invalidated for being a deaf, trans person of color. I spent my last few years of high school listening to my peers chant \"Electrocute the gays\" and attach Trump stickers to every locker during Donald Trump’s first administration. I felt very stuck—I couldn’t vote because I was underage, and while I was out, I hadn’t yet realized that I was trans. I certainly didn’t feel safe enough to share that with my classmates, and I didn’t know how I could tangibly contribute to the fight against the hatred I was seeing around me. Every day, I was trying to do what I could to hold on to my soul—to survive. Now, Trump is in office once again, but despite his full-scale assault on trans lives, something within me is different this time: I have a kind of joy I only felt as a young child—joy without conditions.\n\nCourtesy Chella Man\n\nThis concept is a bit new to me—it wasn’t always this way. For so long, I thought my joy had to be in resistance to those who want to erase me. Years ago, I had made a deal with myself: I made a choice to give my life to fighting for a just world. I wrote down, full of love for who I was and my communities: I am willing to fight until I die against the unfathomable injustices that pervade our society. I moved forward knowing I had set a timer for my own life, anticipating that one day someone would be saying my name in memoriam. That was the only ending I could see at the time. Not because of anything I did, but because of who I was: Deaf, trans, Asian, Jewish, and highly visible as these identities. Because people like me don’t survive the systems we live in. I never had a death wish. I just figured it was inevitable. For years after that, I went to protests, sat on panels, and gave talks all across the country to universities and at brand headquarters. At various points, I imagined someone standing in the crowd and pulling a gun on me, making that day my last. But I showed up anyway because I had made my choice.\n\nIn the end, I found myself in situations where my heart broke again and again. I fought so hard, thinking the world would change. I thought if I was a martyr—if I gave my life to the cause—it would catalyze the world I want to live in. That was the story I told myself. Until now. For the past few years, I’ve been making space to listen to my grief—letting it settle in my chest, listening to what it has to say. I’ve committed to meditation with relentless discipline. I’ve learned that stillness is a crucial part of our fight for liberation and is the balance that our movements need. I can’t offer authenticity to others if I’m not rooted in myself first. Showing up for myself isn’t a betrayal. It’s the only way I can truly show up at all.\n\nCourtesy Chella Man\n\nTurning inward, I found myself sifting through thousands of diaries from the past two decades to jog my memory of who I was and who I’ve grown into. I see how much I endured for so many years, in part because I felt like I was in the dark for so long. No single person, place, or resource held the full truth of my lived experience. I found fragments of myself in different places. I had to be my own representation, my own role model, my own life-saving resource. I see why I had to fight so hard. I had to grieve that so many people did not know how to fight for my freedom, even if they tried. Unlearning martyrdom can be unsettling that way—but necessary.\n\nCourtesy Chella Man\n\nNow, the moments that feel like the world is changing are unexpected: when I paint; when I scale a mountain on a bike; when I lose track of time in the woods; when I notice the leaves of the trees applauding me like they would in sign language, when I nuzzle into the people I love; Change is the peace I feel within, knowing what I want and where I need to be. The world is shaped, etched, and molded every day by people like me. People who are my neighbors, my peers, my elders. But true change starts with the world that exists inside of ourselves, first. On the surface, you may not notice the way things begin to shift. In the morning, for instance, when the light streams through my bedroom window, I used to slap on my cochlear implant immediately. Now, the silence allows me to tune into my inner voice. There is peace in welcoming transformation through stillness, knowing that change is inevitable–our lives are the proof.\n\nIn the reverberations of our chaotic political climate, it’s worth asking: What is your inner voice telling you? How are you thinking for yourself? What do you choose to believe? How can you show up for yourself and build toward a culture in which we all meet our needs and therefore our communities?\n\nFor me, it means recommitting to myself: My joy for being alive is not born out of resistance to any system, no matter who is in office. My joy does not need any reason to exist. It just is. And that has to be more than enough.",

    "title": "Why Climate Change is a National Security Threat",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "The U.S. intelligence community published its 2025 annual threat assessment on March 25. Missing from the document was any mention of climate change—marking the first time in over a decade that the topic has not appeared on the list. \"What I focused this annual threat assessment on, and the [Intelligence Committee] focused this threat assessment on, are the most extreme and critical direct threats to our national security,\" Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in response to questioning on the removal during a Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGabbard said she “didn’t recall” instructing the intelligence community to avoid mentioning climate change in the report. But the change comes amid the Trump Administration’s continued push for a deprioritization of climate change in the federal agenda. Read more: Here Are All of Trump’s Major Moves to Dismantle Climate Action The U.S. government has considered climate change a global security threat for at least three decades. Academic reports at the Naval War College included environmental stressors and climate change in the 1980s, says Mark Nevitt, associate professor of law at Emory University. On the federal level, climate change was first acknowledged as a national security threat by President George W. Bush in August 1991, and the U.S. national security community first listed the issue as a threat in 2008. The issue has typically been included on the annual threat assessment list because of its destabilizing impact—both domestically and abroad. “The annual threat assessment is projecting forward about where the areas of concern and the areas of competition [are], and where the U.S. national security sector should be focusing its attention,” says Nevitt. “Because climate change is just destabilizing different parts of the world, through extreme weather, through droughts, through sea level rise…the intelligence community wants to be ready for future conflicts and future areas of competition.”\n\nClimate change is often referred to as a “threat multiplier” by the intelligence community, because it aggravates already existing problems, while also creating new ones. “It takes things that we were already worried about, like extremism or terrorism, and exacerbates the scale or nature of those threats,” says Scott Moore, practice professor of political science, with a focus on climate and security, at the University of Pennsylvania. “If you have these intensified climate change impacts, they place stress on things like food systems, and worsen already existing tensions within countries.” Climate migration, for example, is on the rise around the world—more than half of new internal displacements within countries registered in 2023 were caused by weather related disasters, according to the Migration Data Portal. “Mass migration leads to a lot of political and social tensions as well as border issues,” says Karen Seto, professor of geography and urbanization science at the Yale School of the Environment. “That … could affect national security, because it could destabilize an entire region.” One study from the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that extreme weather is contributing to migration into the United States through the southern border—with more migrants from agricultural regions in Mexico settling in the United States following extreme drought.\n\nSuch displacement can have major impacts on people's lives and livelihoods, experts say—especially in already fragile regions. “If you have, for example, a really extreme and intensified drought in a country in which extremist ideologies are percolating, these climate change impacts may make it more likely that people are going to stop farming, or might migrate to cities where they may face difficult employment prospects, be socially dislocated and may be more vulnerable to extremism or engaging in some type of violence,” says Moore. On a domestic level, considering climate change helps the U.S. military ensure that infrastructure is built to withstand extreme weather events—and respond to national disasters both domestically and abroad. “You need the National Guard, the Coast Guard, the U.S. military, to basically help out their community when there's an extreme weather event,” says Nevitt. As extreme weather events intensify with climate change this could strain military resources and put more lives at risk if the military does not prepare to address the threat.\n\nInfrastructure within the U.S., like energy and internet grids, also need to be fortified. If regions were to lose power in the case of an extreme weather event, the networks could be vulnerable to attack. “Our energy grid is highly at risk, and we've seen wildfires happening across the country, and so these could again be threat multipliers,\" says Seto. “I think the national security risk is that we are not ready to respond to any threats from foreign agents that may take advantage of the weaknesses that we might have.” Showing that the climate crisis is a priority is also necessary to maintain the United States’s diplomatic strength—especially in regions that see climate change as a top concern. “Other countries, in particular countries that are very significant for the U.S. defense posture, like the Pacific Island countries, really care about climate change a lot. They want to hear what the United States is willing to do to help them deal with climate change,” says Moore. “And so when you have the instructions to essentially ignore climate change, or in an extreme version almost censor mention of climate change, that's going to have a harmful effect on diplomatic engagement with some pretty important countries.”\n\nAnd experts say that removing climate change from the list—and deprioritizing the issue writ large—is only going to leave the U.S. more vulnerable. “This is going to make the administration and national security sector less nimble, because they might not have the people, the plans, the policy, [and] capacity in place when disaster inevitably strikes,” warns Nevitt. “You can't just wish climate change away.”",

    "content": "More than 12,000 acres have burned in North and South Carolina as wildfires continue to rage through the states’ western region. The situation has prompted emergency declarations in both states, and mandatory evacuations have been ordered in several counties. The wildfires come as many continue to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene just six months ago. The category 4 storm killed more than 100 people in North Carolina and over 50 in South Carolina. This week’s blazes were in part fueled by downed timber from the hurricane, coupled with wind and dry conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere’s how you can help victims and first responders in the Carolinas. Associa Cares Associa Cares was created to help families and communities in the wake of disasters. The organization aims to provide direct financial relief to those impacted and has already earmarked $100,000 to support individuals and families affected by the recent wildfires across North and South Carolina. American Red Cross The American Red Cross has been providing emergency assistance and disaster relief for over a century. The organization has opened an evacuation shelter in South Carolina and is supporting several shelters in North Carolina. While it says it no longer is in need of supplies to help wildfire survivors, the organization is still accepting monetary donations. World Central Kitchen World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit food relief organization founded by celebrity chef José Andrés, is often on the ground providing meals for victims and first responders of disasters around the world. The organization is currently in North Carolina providing meals for first responders.\n\nSouth Carolina Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (SCVOAD)\n\nSouth Carolina Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, an offshoot of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, is an association of groups that help provide services to communities affected by disaster. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division “ways to help” webpage directs individuals to make monetary donations to SCVOAD, and contact them for volunteer opportunities.\n\nCity of Walhalla Fire Department\n\nThe city of Walhalla's fire department has posted a list of needed items for the 400 first responders combating fires in South Carolina. The department asks that the requested items, which range from eye drops to safety goggles, are delivered by Friday, March 28.",

    "title": "Medicare Will Not Cover GLP-1 Drugs for Weight Loss",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently announced—without explanation—that it would not proceed with a proposal initiated by the Biden Administration to cover weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound for its beneficiaries. Medicare and Medicaid recipients can be reimbursed for the medications to treat diabetes, but currently the anti-obesity versions of these drugs will not be covered. As an obesity treatment, Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk, comes with a slightly higher dose for treating obesity than doses for diabetes; the medication is otherwise the same. For Zepbound, developed by Lilly, it's the same drug and administered in the same dose as Mounjaro, which is used to treat diabetes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Biden proposal would have included coverage of Wegovy and Zepbound to treat obesity under Medicare Part D for Medicare Advantage. “While today’s announcement was limited, we hope that with the confirmation of the new CMS director, the Trump Administration will move forward to finalize the definition of obesity. It is essential that CMS regulations are aligned with current medical science—and that means recognizing obesity as a serious chronic disease,” a spokesperson from Novo Nordisk said in a statement to TIME. A Lilly spokesperson said in a statement to TIME that the company “is disappointed in the MA-Part D rule because it is not the best reading of the statute and impacts patient access to obesity treatments,” referring to the program that allows enrollees to receive coverage of prescription drugs, including through private plans and through Medicare Advantage. “We will continue to work with the Trump Administration and Congressional leaders to ensure people living with obesity are covered by Medicare and Medicaid and are no longer left behind.”\n\nHow Weight Loss Drugs Work\n\nThe decision not to expand coverage to include obesity treatment would mean nearly 7.5 million Medicare and Medicaid recipients won’t be reimbursed for the drug to help them lose weight. Government health care financing analysts noted in Sept. 2024 that the high cost of the drugs would result in higher government spending with “little information on longer-term effects of the drugs.”\n\nHowever, health experts have raised concerns that denying coverage could lead to additional health costs for insurers, as scientists are discovering that the drugs come with many other health benefits. The drugs have already received additional indications from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to lower the risk of heart disease and obstructive sleep apnea. And researchers are currently studying them for other benefits as well, including reducing the risk of kidney, liver, and brain diseases like Alzheimer’s and addiction.",

    "title": "Trump Doubles Down on Trade War, Threatening China With More Tariffs",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "President Donald Trump on Monday doubled down on his trade war and threatened to levy even higher tariffs on China this week, as markets endured a third day of intense volatility. “We've been ripped off and taken advantage of by many countries over the years, and can't do it anymore,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office on Monday. “We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTrump’s commitment to his tariffs comes amid mounting pressure from economists, investors, and even Republicans in Congress for the White House to pause a trade strategy many fear could drive a global recession. Last week, Trump imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports, as well as additional tariffs on some 90 countries. On Sunday, Goldman Sachs said the probability of a recession in the next 12 months had jumped to 45%. “We have $36 trillion in debt. I want to get rid of it, and we can do it quickly with proper deals,” Trump said Monday. “Countries don't allow us to sell our product, but we allow them to sell their product…They charge us massive amounts of money for the privilege of going into their country. Those days are over.” The meeting marked the first time Trump met in-person with a foreign leader since he unveiled the sweeping new tariffs last week in a rambling and unclear announcement in which he described an opaque formula used to calculate higher tariff rates on adversaries and allies alike. The strategy drew puzzlement from economists, who quickly found errors and inconsistencies in how the administration calculated the new tariff rates.\n\nSome countries have attempted to quickly show they can address Trump’s unhappiness with the current trade status quo. During Monday’s press meeting, Netanyahu claimed he would work hard to “quickly” eliminate the trade deficit with the U.S.—though President Trump did not respond with a commitment to reduce the new 17% tariff on the country. “Don’t forget, we help Israel a lot,” Trump said in reference to the billions of aid the U.S. sends their closest Middle Eastern ally. Others have responded more firmly. China retaliated with a 34% tariff against American imports, which the President criticized during the press conference and on his social media platform. “If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump threatened on Truth Social Monday morning.\n\nSeveral business leaders have called on Trump to pause the implementation of his tariffs and impose a more predictable strategy to pressure more manufacturers to produce goods inside the U.S. Bill Ackman, a hedge fund manager who has supported Trump, warned of a “self-induced, economic nuclear winter” if Trump doesn’t change course. “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital,” Ackman wrote Sunday on X. Trump said he wasn't worried about driving trading partners to China, claiming that many countries have already approached him about negotiations. To some extent, Trump recognized that building up domestic manufacturing and bringing back jobs would take time.\n\n“You got to build a thing called the factory. You have to build your energy. You have to do a lot of things,\" he said. \"I'm giving them energy. You know, we're going to let them build their own power plants. They'll be their own ... We need massive amounts of electricity. We're going to compete with China and others.\"",

    "title": "Rashid Johnson and the Fine Art of Anxiety",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "Jan. 28, 1986, was a day that changed Rashid Johnson. He remembers the TV set being rolled into his elementary-school classroom in Evanston, Ill.He remembers watching with his classmates as the space shuttle Challenger flew into the air and transformed into a stream of white cloud. “I remember how that affected my thinking, recognizing that failure was possible amongst adults, amongst folks who we were supposed to trust,” says the artist, sitting in his spacious Brooklyn studio, surrounded by works that are being prepared for a massive midcareer survey at the Guggenheim in New York City. “That was a big one for me.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSeeing the footage of Rodney King being beaten by police in Los Angeles in 1991 also loomed large in Johnson’s life, as well as the acquittal of those officers of any wrongdoing, and the riots that followed. “I was in my young teenage years at that point,” says Johnson, now 47. “And becoming aware of the angst and anxiety and frustration of Black folks in America against the backdrop of what absolutely felt like incredibly unfair decisionmaking by the collective.” The artist has lived through joyous moments in history too—two days before the Challenger explosion, the Bears won their first and only Super Bowl—but it’s the alarming ones that made the biggest impression. “I was an anxious kid,” he says. “I think what we’re exposed to at different stages in our lives absolutely informs how we see the world.” Johnson has spent his career exploring, via his hands, what it means to be unsettled and what it means to be Black and what it means to be male and what it means to be Rashid Johnson, using whatever medium he finds inspiring at the time. His artworks, which include paintings, sculptures, mixed-media assemblages, mosaics, photographs, and film, are full of mood and foreboding. There’s beauty, humor, and exuberance as well. But it is the anxiety, especially as represented by a square-headed figure with whirlpool eyes and a frantically scribbled mouth, for which he is best known.\n\nThese days Johnson manages his anxiety in many ways. He’s extremely punctual. He works out daily. He goes to the Russian baths a couple of times a week. He has given up alcohol, is a regular at AA meetings, and frequently deploys the Serenity Prayer. He recently decided that he can trust the things he can’t control to God. Even so, as we speak he breaks out a packet of high-end Daneson toothpicks and chews on one. “This is born of an oral fixation after I quit smoking six years ago,” he says.\n\nErik Tanner for TIME\n\nHe also works that anxiety out through his art, in series with such titles as Anxious Men, Broken Men, Anxious Red, Surrender Paintings, and Bruise Paintings. The first of these was made in 2014, during the Black Lives Matter protests. He was a father by then and newly sober, so his reasons to worry increased just as he cut off access to his go-to liquid soothers. “I was thinking about my anxiety,” he says, “and kind of almost humorously depicting this character of anxiety, or trying to illustrate what anxiety might look like, through a set of wild gestures.”\n\nThe motif became newly relevant during the pandemic amid the stay-at-home measures and the increase in police-brutality videos that surfaced after George Floyd’s murder. “When people were taking ownership of it,” he says, “I began to make crowds and groups of anxious men, because I recognized that it was a collective position.” Now the Anxious Man has become one of his signatures. And like Keith Haring’s Radiant Baby or Jean-Michel Basquiat’s crown, it has attained totem status; it’s on T-shirts, plates, and jewelry. Not only does Kendall Roy wear a $30,000 dog-tag pendant with the image on it during his “progressive” phase in Succession, the actor who plays him, Jeremy Strong, owns another version of the necklace, with his daughters’ names and birthdays engraved on the back.\n\nOne thing Johnson has rarely had to worry about is critical or commercial support. His solo show at the Guggenheim, “Rashid Johnson: A Poem for Deep Thinkers,” opens April 18, and will feature some 25 years of work, including photos he took in his early 20s, which were selected for Thelma Golden’s seminal “Freestyle” show at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 2001. He has pieces in galleries and public spaces across the globe and has had solo shows on nearly every continent. His work is prized by collectors and keeps getting more valuable. (In November, a triptych of Anxious Men paintings sold for $2.7 million at Christie’s.) He and his wife, the artist Sheree Hovsepian, have swoon-worthy houses in Manhattan’s Gramercy Park and the beach town of East Hampton. On the day TIME visits his studio, he is wearing a $4,000 cashmere tracksuit and a $200,000-plus Rolex Daytona Le Mans, which isn’t even his fanciest watch.\n\nGolden exhibited Johnson’s photographs of homeless men, which he’d printed using a 19th century technique known as Van Dyke brown, because she recognized “these deeply intimate and engaged portraits that felt old while they were at the very same time, very new,” she says. “Van Dyke prints often indicate to us a certain sense of historic photography. Rashid, as a young artist, was taking that on in a way that I felt also showed how much he had looked at the history of photography and portraiture as a base.” Golden wasn’t the only person who intuited Johnson’s success early. McArthur Binion, a painter who took Johnson under his wing in the graduate program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, noticed right away that he had all the ingredients to make it big. “You have to have the right brain cells and the right support. Rashid is fourth-generation college-educated, and as a Black person in America, that’s amazing,” says Binion. But it wasn’t just the education. “Pardon my French, but he has balls. He’s smart. He’s good-looking,” says Binion. “He has a level of patience; he allows things to come to him.”\n\nUntitled (Shea Butter Table), 2016 Martin Parsekian—Courtesy Rashid Johnson\n\nUntitled (Shea Butter Table), 2016 Martin Parsekian—Courtesy Rashid Johnson\n\nBinion used to meet former students at a bar every second Wednesday. At one of those soirées a few years after Johnson graduated, Binion told him he could see his future. “I told him, ‘Next year you are gonna make at least $100,000 from your art.’ And he laughed at me. He said, ‘No way,’” says Binion. “And he made $200,000.”\n\n“I’ve been rewarded in ways that I would never have expected to be rewarded as an artist,” says Johnson, who grew up more or less middle class. His mother Cheryl Johnson-Odim was a history professor and anti-apartheid activist in Chicago and is still a poet, and his father Jimmy Johnson owned an electronics company. “I’m grateful every time a work of mine is acquired,” he says. But he feels no obligation to feed the art market. “I don’t have to pander to that wealth creation.” Things were different when he showed at Nicole Klagsbrun’s Manhattan gallery in 2008. A few days before the exhibit came down, nothing much had sold. The show was mostly photographs from Johnson’s The New Negro Escapist Social and Athletic Club series, faux-historical portraits of sharply dressed Black men one might find in an old-school club lounge, with names that evoke Black history such as Emmett and Thurgood. There was also a crosshair sculpture that referenced the logo of the band Public Enemy.\n\nIt seemed an unlikely venue for a breakthrough. “Nicole was located, like, on the sixth floor of some monster building,” says Mera Rubell, an influential collector and the co-founder of the Rubell museums. “You know, you get off the elevator and walk three miles inside the building to get to a door.” Rubell may be foggy on the location, but she has a crystal-clear recall of what she found behind that door. “We walked in and we said, ‘Wait a minute. How is this possible, that this work is available?’” she says of the visit with her husband and co-founder Don and her son Jason, who works with them. “We just were kind of blown away. This is a talent that we didn’t know, which is what we live for.” They bought six pieces for their show “30 Americans,” which traveled to 17 other galleries, and they put one of Johnson’s photographs on the cover of the catalog. (They now own 22.) There’s never just one big break in an art career, but that was a good-size one.\n\nBoth Golden and the Rubells were drawn in by the work, but what really sealed the deal was meeting the artist. “He’s far more educated and sophisticated than most artists,” says Don, unable to resist jumping in on his wife’s speakerphone call from Miami. Johnson has a serious but friendly way of bringing people into his vision. “I’ve always tried to be really attentive to answering questions,” he says, “so that if there’s an audience in the future and they have the curiosity and the ambition and the enthusiasm to search out what I was thinking about around it, I’d provide the language.” And while Johnson grew up around “wordy people”—his younger sister is also a poet and his older brother is a lawyer—he’s not precious about the way his art is talked about. “I really don’t like the idea that my project, even with all of its diversity and complexity, is opaque,” he says. “I want people to feel agency to talk about it, say what they feel when they see it, and to trust themselves.”\n\nArt handlers hold a painting by Johnson titled Untitled Anxious Audience at Christie's in London on June 20, 2023. Wiktor Szymanowicz—Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nThe Guggenheim is something of a homecoming for Johnson; he served on its board for seven years until 2023. (“While the idea of organizing an exhibition has been in progress for a long time, plans did not proceed until after Rashid’s tenure on the board was over,” says a museum spokesperson.) As he’s revisited his work and figured out how to display it best in the museum’s famous curved ramp, he’s had a chance to reflect on the many paths he’s explored. These paths have included, so far, working with hair lotion, shea-butter soap, wax, shelving, at least one piano, mirrors, tiles, vinyl records, and old wooden floors as well as such conventional art products as oil paint and canvas. “My interests happen to consider both the aesthetic sensibility of an art object, how it can be rewarding to witness, and how it can be rewarding to think about in a more critical way,” he says. “That dichotomy is very specific to how I think.”\n\nTake shea butter, for instance. Johnson grew up using the soap in his home. He saw it for sale in Afrocentric stores or on the street. “It became this tool that was understood as a representation of an Africanness,” he says. “But it also has a utility, it moisturizes your body. Some people, historically, would cook with it. So I became really interested in the material, and I found ways to deploy it.” The show is also allowing him to revisit some old ideas, and to play with them. “There’s a body of work called Cosmic Slops that I was making around 2008 that were about incising and the removal of material and how you create lines,” he says. He points to two cream paintings in front of him. “These works, which I’m calling Quiet Paintings, are actually the children of those. They were finished yesterday.” He seems to be relishing the opportunity to get away from just being the Anxious Man. “I’m also a person filled with joy. I have an endless number of positive interactions and family and experiences and things that make me, you know, happy,” he says. “I think the Guggenheim show will kind of amplify that, like, this sh-t to me is sometimes very funny.”\n\nJohnson has the kind of success people dream of. He’s wealthy beyond his wildest imagination. He has enough influence that he can—and does—shine a light on other artists. He and his L.A. art dealer David Kordansky have resurrected the careers of several overlooked Black artists, including Sam Gilliam before he died. But asked when he knew that he was going to make it as an artist, Johnson can’t quite get there. “I’ve always been a person who aspired to the freedom of the idea that I would at some point have the resources and enthusiasm of an audience that would allow me to do this in perpetuity. That’s absolutely something I aspire to,” he says. “I think I’m getting closer.”\n\nCorrection, March 31\n\nThe original version of this story misstated the opening date of Johnson's show at the Guggenheim. It is April 18, not April 16.",

    "title": "What We Must Understand About the Dark Enlightenment Movement",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "Filippo Tommaso Marinetti liked automobiles, particularly his four-cylinder Fiat sports car. For him, the car represented innovation and vitality, even violence. Most of all, it signified the future. An Italian poet, performer, and pamphleteer, Marinetti was a reactionary; he loathed egalitarianism and democracy. He also wasn’t a conservative in any traditional sense, for there was little that he, and others in the Futurist art movement that he founded, wished to conserve. In his 1909 treatise, Founding and Manifesto of Futurism, he wrote, “We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind.” A precursor to the fascism that would envelop Europe, Marinetti was an influence on Benito Mussolini, and that ideology, which would soon fulfill that dark promise of destroying Europe’s museums, libraries, and academies.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMarinetti’s stronghold over Mussolini has striking parallels to America today—particularly with the rise of the “Dark Enlightenment” movement and its most vocal steward: software engineer and blogger Curtis Yarvin. Largely ignored by academic philosophers, the “Dark Enlightenment” movement and Yarvin have curried favor and influence with tech executives in recent years. A software engineer by training, Yarvin has become a kind of official philosopher for tech leaders like PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel and Mosaic founder Marc Andreessen. Not unlike the Futurists, Yarvin advocates for replacing democracy with a kind of techno-feudal state—for the government to be run like a corporation, with the president as its “CEO.” This new system is elitist—“humans fit into dominance-submission structures” Yarvin wrote in 2008; and it’s authoritarian—“If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia,” he said in 2012. There are shades of Yarvin’s philosophy in Thiel’s 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, where he wrote “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” And Thiel, through his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, was an early investor in the blogger’s startup company Urbit. As for Yarvin’s controversial opinions and whether or not Thiel holds them, Yarvin has said that his patron is “fully enlightened,” as he had been “coaching Thiel.” What’s more, in a recent interview with the Hoover Institution, Andreessen quoted Yarvin and called him a “friend.”\n\nWhat’s even more alarming is that Yarvin’s outsize influence on tech executives has now made its way to Washington. The signs are everywhere: Yarvin was a feted guest at Trump’s so-called “Coronation Ball” in January 2025. Vice President J.D. Vance, a protegee of Thiel’s, spoke admiringly of the blogger’s influence on his thinking when interviewed on a podcast in July 2024. And while Andreessen’s role in the Trump White House is unofficial, The Washington Post reported in January 2025 that the executive “has been quietly and successfully recruiting candidates for positions across Trump’s Washington.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk, though not outwardly tipping his hat to Yarvin, seemingly has a similar philosophy: In 2020, Musk told the Wall Street Journal that the “government is simply the largest corporation.” Five years later, Musk has been using his position as an unofficial advisor to the second Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to operationalize what Yarvin has called “a hard reboot” of the government.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington As such, it behooves us to be more familiar with Yarvin and other associated figureheads of this far-right philosophy. Understanding their motivations is essential to understanding what the stakes currently are—and how history can repeat itself. Much can be gleaned about the attractions of this ideology to many of those in power from simply parsing the name of the movement. “Dark Enlightenment” portends the upending of the liberal order that has defined democratic aspirations for nearly three centuries. Where the Enlightenment promised liberty, emancipation, equality, and solidarity, “Dark Enlightenment” offers servitude, hierarchy, bondage, and ruthlessness. The movement is most often associated with the British philosopher Nick Land. Land was a founder of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom until 1995 when his own increasingly erratic behavior had him expelled. Land is actively anti-democratic, desiring a system where great men (guided by algorithms and artificial intelligence) steer the ship of state. This is an explicitly nihilistic vision—“Nothing human makes it out of the near-future,” wrote Land in 1994—an ideology combining technological utopianism with deep misanthropy, a variant of what the historian Jeffrey Herf described as “reactionary modernism,” but which we might as well call cybernetic authoritarianism or technological fascism.\n\nThis leads us to Yarvin. A polemical blogger, Yarvin wrote for years under the goofy name “Mencius Moldbug” where he advocated for his own form of techno-authoritarianism in opposition to democracy. Like Marinetti, Yarvin expressed disdain for those symbols of American culture that he sees as oppositional to “Dark Enlightenment”—from free voting to free inquiry, a vibrant media to the open university. Yarvin, writing in 2021, posited (with significantly less poetry than the Futurists), “Because the university is the heart of the old regime, it is absolutely essential to the success of any regime change that all accredited universities be both physically and economically liquidated.” Yarvin speaks disparagingly of something that he calls “The Cathedral,” a nexus of educational, media, and nonprofit organizations that he believes sets the tenor for discourse, but that also impedes the liberty of executives to do what they will. Rather his aspiration is, as he wrote in 2007, that “the state is simply a real estate business on a very large scale.”\n\nUsing a variety of mixed metaphors, Yarvin advocates for a “Butterfly Revolution,” a “full power start” to the U.S. government accomplished by “giving absolute sovereignty to a single organization.\" This is imagined as an internal coup meant to privatize the government and replace democracy with complete executive authority. Two years ago, Yarvin laid out his strategic program with the acronym “RAGE,” or “Retire all government employees.” Yarvin argued that a hypothetical future Trump administration should terminate all nonpolitical federal workers to have them be replaced by loyalists. The government’s coffers must then be impounded and redirected, according to the blogger. When courts prevent unconstitutional orders, Yarvin says that they should just be ignored. After that, the free press and universities must be curtailed, as well—Yarvin said no later than April after the inauguration.\n\nThat so much of this seems to mirror the actions of the Trump administration and DOGE may not be a coincidence. So far, some 30,000 federal employees—across departments as varied as the FDA, the National Park Service, and the FAA—have been fired by DOGE in the name of government efficiency. Yarvin’s musings in 2009 that the “definition of a sovereign is that a sovereign is above the law,” hold a mirror to Trump’s February tweet that “He who save his country, violates no law.”\n\nYarvin’s claim that “No brand or building can survive” is perfectly congruent with the tech industry’s notorious ethos to “Move fast and break things.” But what’s also being seemingly witnessed is a harbinger of the “monarchism” that Yarvin desires. On February 19, Trump posted a doctored image of himself in a crown with the caption “Long Live the King!” on his social media app Truth Social.\n\nAs is so often the case with Trump, pundits have a tendency to assume a lack of seriousness or intention with what the president says. The same dismissiveness sometimes accompanied the Futurists, and Mussolini’s fascists for that matter, when they were ascendant. Now, as Trump threatens longtime American allies from Panama to Mexico, Canada to Denmark, a belief of the Futurists even more disturbing than their worship of technology should be remembered: Marinetti’s claim that “War is the hygiene of the world.”",

    "title": "9 Big Questions About Trump’s ‘Reciprocal’ Tariffs, Answered",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — After weeks of anticipation and speculation, President Donald Trump followed through on his tariff threats this week by declaring a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States. Global markets cratered the day after the announcement and then fell further when China announced it would retaliate with tariffs equal to the ones the U.S. is imposing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRead More: What to Know About the Countries Facing the Highest Trump ‘Reciprocal’ Tariffs In announcing what he has called reciprocal tariffs, Trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise by raising U.S. taxes on foreign goods to narrow the gap with the tariffs the White House says other countries unfairly impose on U.S. products. Trump’s higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the United States than they buy. But economists don’t share Trump’s enthusiasm for tariffs since they’re a tax on importers that usually get passed on to consumers. It’s possible, however, that the reciprocal tariffs could bring other countries to the table and get them to lower their own import taxes. The Associated Press asked for your questions about reciprocal tariffs. Here are a few of them, along with our answers: What is Trump trying to accomplish with his tariffs? It is often unclear what the president’s endgame is, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding his trade wars. He has given different reasons for his sweeping import taxes, and sometimes they contradict each other.\n\nTrump has said that tariffs can raise money for the U.S. Treasury, protect U.S. industries, draw factories to the United States and serve as a negotiating tactic to get other countries to bend to his will, whether it means getting them to reduce their own tariffs or to crack down on the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants into the United States. But if tariffs mean Americans buy fewer imports or if companies relocate factories to the United States, then revenue from tariffs will fall, undercutting his plan to use them as a money generating alternative to the income tax. Trump and his own aides have also offered competing explanations for the sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs he announced Wednesday. The president on Thursday said the levies “give us great power to negotiate” and were coaxing other countries into offering to lower their own trade barriers. “Every country is calling us,” Trump said. “That’s the beauty of what we do. We put ourselves in the driver’s seat.”\n\nThe same day, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC that the tariffs were meant to stay: The idea is to get companies to produce goods in America, not abroad, bringing down longstanding U.S. trade deficits. “Let me make this very clear,” he said. “This is not a negotiation. This is not that. This is a national emergency.” Read More: The U.S. Has a Long History of Tariffs. Here’s How Trump’s Compare What is currency manipulation? Currency manipulation takes place when a country deliberately pushes the value of its currency lower, which makes its companies’ exports cheaper in foreign markets and gives them an unfair competitive advantage. It can do this buy selling its own currency and buying another country’s—usually the U.S. dollar—in foreign exchange markets. In announcing sweeping tariffs this year, Trump has accused other countries of using this tactic to gain an unfair edge over American companies. China, in particular, was notorious for years for manipulating its currency lower to boost exports. But last November the Biden administration’s Treasury Department concluded that “no major U.S. trading partner” had manipulated its currency to gain an unfair advantage in the fiscal year that ended in June 2024.\n\nThe U.S. dollar’s status as the world’s “reserve currency”—used far more than others in global commerce—tends to keep its value high, which can put U.S. exporters at a disadvantage. Read More: Is the U.S. Heading Into a Recession? Tariffs Fallout Sparks Fresh Fears How were the tariffs imposed by Trump calculated? Do other countries really have such high tariffs? According to the Trump administration, the European Union’s tariffs and trade barriers against the U.S. amount to a 39% tariff on U.S. goods, while China’s, it says, are 67%, and India’s 52%. Those are much higher than what other sources say. The World Trade Organizations puts the E.U.’s average tariffs on all imports at 2.7%, China’s at 3%, and India’s at 12%. The Trump administration says it is including currency manipulation, government subsidies, and other barriers to trade in its calculations. Trump said Wednesday he was being “kind” and then charging half what other countries imposed on the U.S. So the U.S. will as of April 9 impose 20% duties on imports from Europe, 26% on India, and 34% on China. For China, that’s in addition to other duties, which means some Chinese goods will face duties as high as 79%.\n\nMany countries do take other steps besides tariffs to restrict access to their markets. The E.U., for example, restricts imports of hormone-treated beef from the U.S. And the U.S. government has long complained that China doesn’t protect intellectual property, such as software made by American companies. Still, those factors don’t explain how the administration came up with such high numbers for other countries’ tariffs. Instead, the White House says it did a simple calculation: It took the size of each country’s trade imbalance on goods with the United States and divided that by how much America imports from that nation. It then took half that percentage and made it the new tariff rate. Read More: ‘Inflation Day Rather Than Liberation Day’: How the World Is Reacting to Trump’s Latest Tariffs Do U.S.-collected tariffs go into the General Revenue Fund? Can Trump withdraw money from that fund without oversight?\n\nTariffs are taxes on imports, collected when foreign goods cross the U.S. border by the Customs and Border Protection agency. The money—about $80 billion last year—goes to the U.S. Treasury to help pay the federal government’s expenses. Congress has authority to say how the money will be spent. Trump—largely supported by Republican lawmakers who control the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives—wants to use increased tariff revenue to finance tax cuts that analysts say would disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Specifically, they want to extend tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term and largely set to expire at the end of 2025. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, has found that extending Trump’s tax cuts would reduce federal revenue by $4.5 trillion from 2025 to 2034. Trump wants higher tariffs to help offset the lower tax collections. Another think tank, the Tax Policy Center, has said that extending the 2017 tax cuts would deliver continued tax relief to Americans at all income levels, “but higher-income households would receive a larger benefit.”\n\nRead More: Congress Is Freaking Out About Trump’s Trade War—but Not Enough to Stop Him How soon will prices rise as a result of the tariff policy? It depends on how businesses both in the United States and overseas respond, but consumers could see overall prices rising within a month or two of tariffs being imposed. For some products, such as produce from Mexico, prices could rise much more quickly after the tariffs take effect. Some U.S. retailers and other importers may eat part of the cost of the tariff, and overseas exporters may reduce their prices to offset the extra duties. But for many businesses, the tariffs Trump announced Wednesday—such as 20% on imports from Europe—will be too large to swallow on their own. Companies may also use the tariffs as an excuse to raise prices. When Trump slapped duties on washing machines in 2018, studies later showed that retailers raised prices on both washers and dryers, even though there were no new duties on dryers.\n\nA key question in the coming months is whether something similar will happen again. Economists worry that consumers, having just lived through the biggest inflationary spike in four decades, are more accustomed to rising prices than they were before the pandemic. Yet there are also signs that Americans, put off by the rise in the cost of living, are less willing to accept price increases and will simply cut back on their purchases. That could discourage businesses from raising prices by much. Read More: How Trump’s Tariffs Will Impact U.S. Consumers What is the limit of the executive branch’s power to implement tariffs? Does Congress not play any role? The U.S. Constitution grants the power to set tariffs to Congress. But over the years, Congress has delegated those powers to the president through several different laws. Those laws specify the circumstances under which the White House can impose tariffs, which are typically limited to cases where imports threaten national security or are severely harming a specific industry.\n\nIn the past, presidents generally imposed tariffs only after carrying out public hearings to determine if certain imports met those criteria. Trump followed those steps when imposing tariffs in his first term.\n\nIn his second term, however, Trump has sought to use emergency powers set out in a 1977 law to impose tariffs in a more ad hoc fashion. Trump has said, for example, that fentanyl flowing in from Canada and Mexico constitute a national emergency and has used that pretext to impose 25% duties on goods from both countries.\n\nCongress can seek to cancel an emergency that a president declares, and Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, has proposed to do just that regarding Canada. That legislation could pass the Senate but would likely die in the House. Other bills in Congress that would also limit the president’s authority to set tariffs face tough odds for passage as well.",

Instead, as the televised briefing began, Zelensky reached for another one of his gifts. It was a folder containing a series of gruesome photographs, showing Ukrainian prisoners of war after their time in Russian captivity. Some of their bodies were grotesquely emaciated. Others showed signs of torture. “That’s tough stuff,” Trump said, his face leaden, as he took the photos from Zelensky and began leafing through them.\n\nThose pictures, according to some U.S. officials, marked the point when the meeting went wrong. Had Zelensky offered the championship belt, the gesture might have lightened the mood. The photos had the opposite effect. They seemed to get Trump’s guard up, as though he were being blamed for the suffering of those soldiers. Still, even today, Zelensky does not regret his decision to present these images. He had been trying to reach beyond Trump’s transactional instincts, beyond his need for flattery, and appeal to Trump as a human being. “He has family, loved ones, children. He has to feel the things that every person feels,” Zelensky says. “What I wanted to show were my values. But then, well, the conversation went in another direction.”",

    "title": "Trump Guts Program that Helps Low-Income Homes Pay for Heat",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "The Trump administration has laid off the entire staff of a $4.1 billion program that helps millions of low-income households pay for heat during the winter, unnerving state officials who are now wondering whether they will still receive millions of dollars in expected federal payments. The roughly two dozen workers who ran the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program were among 10,000 people fired as part of a dramatic restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe said several senior employees who oversee the program, which serves about 6.2 million households annually, told him they were locked out of their building after arriving to work Monday. “The way they did it, there was no like warning,” he said. On Thursday, 13 U.S. senators, including two Republicans, sent a letter to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging the administration to reverse its decision to cut the LIHEAP staff. They warned the terminations will undermine the agency's ability to provide a “crucial lifeline” for low-income seniors and families. The program had already delivered the bulk of its aid to the states for this fiscal year but had yet to distribute $378 million. It also helps households pay for the cost of air conditioning during sweltering summer months. When asked about the fate of LIHEAP and the outstanding payments, Emily Hilliard, deputy press secretary for HHS, said in a statement: “HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements, and as a result of the reorganization, will be better positioned to execute on Congress’s statutory intent.”\n\nSpeaking about the broader overhaul of his agency, Kennedy has said it needs to be “recalibrated.\" Without any staff in place, states are questioning how and if they will get the rest of their money, especially for upcoming summer cooling programs. “Will we receive our remaining funds? If we don’t, some states will not run their cooling programs this summer. They’ll scale them back,” Wolfe said. State officials involved in distributing aid said they are concerned LIHEAP will collapse without federal support. “Emails bounce back from people that we have worked with for many years, who are deeply knowledgeable of the program,” said Peter Hadler, deputy director of the Connecticut Department of Social Services, noting his state is still owed $8 million. In Minnesota, where the northern part of the state received a foot of snow Wednesday, the state's Department of Commerce predicted that by mid-April it will run out of money to help new applicants seeking help with heating and electric bills.\n\nThe state had been expecting an additional $12 million to $13 million in federal funding, already approved by Congress. Those funds would help more than 10,000 households pay their utility bills and prevent power shutoffs. About 130,000 Minnesota households receive assistance each year through LIHEAP.\n\n“Winter is still happening in Minnesota. It snowed yesterday,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources at the department. “We do need that extra money to come through to get us through the rest of the winter season.”\n\nEligibility can differ by state, as well as the specific services provided. In general, the program assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades.\n\nSens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the two Republicans who signed on to the letter imploring Kennedy to reverse any staffing or funding cuts that would jeopardize the program.",

    "content": "Despite the extended monologue by the monk at the beginning of Sunday night’s finale about how life has no resolutions, Season 3 of The White Lotus did, ultimately, come to a tidy ending—if a rather dark and, if you spent a lot of time reading theories on the Internet, somewhat predictable one. While the deaths in the first two seasons of The White Lotus were almost comical in nature—accidental affairs involving the stabbing of a man who just defecated in a suitcase and a ditzy heiress escaping a murder plot only to trip and fall off a boat—the deaths this season were violent and intentional.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere’s who died, who didn’t, who left Thailand a whole lot richer, and what it all means. Lochlan Ratliff almost dies by poison fruit smoothie\n\nTimothy almost loses what really matters in his spiral over losing his money Courtesy of HBO\n\nWe knew there would be gunshots in the finale: Zion hears crossfire and finds a body floating in the water in the first five minutes of the very first episode. But first came a feint. There was a brief moment in which it looked like Timothy Ratliff would poison his entire family save Lochlan—the only family member who told his dad he thought he could survive without a lot of money—by blending up the poisonous seeds of a fruit that’s been ominously hanging from the trees shading the family’s villa all season. (And that blender did seem to be getting louder and louder, prompting me to predict this very fate for at least one of the Ratliffs.) But Timothy, after barring the underage Lochlan from the special piña coladas, ultimately knocks the smoothie out of his eldest son Saxon’s hand, declaring that the coconut milk was off. He can’t follow through on the murder-suicide fantasies he’s had all season.\n\nLater, Lochlan, a pampered teenager too lazy to even consider rinsing out the blender, uses it to make the protein shake his brother will no longer serve to him: Earlier in the episode Saxon dismissively tells Lochy that nobody will make him a man, he has to do it himself. It seemed like Lochlan’s tainted smoothie would indeed take his life, especially as he has a vision of drowning as four silhouetted monks stand above him. But the youngest Ratliff child miraculously wakes up. (In fairness, it’s not like his dad had a phone to Google the correct dosage of the poison fruit.) So what have the Ratliffs learned? A little. Timothy has learned that losing his wealth sure beats losing a child. Victoria has hopefully learned to hide her lorazepam better. Piper has learned she can’t live without organic food and air conditioning. Lochy has learned that he’s a people-pleaser in a family full of narcissists (which is apparently why he wanted to help his brother whose only goal in life is to “get off”). And Saxon has learned there’s more to life than getting off—and also how to read a book.\n\nOn the boat to the resort, the Ratliff children were lined up in the “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” positions. On the boat departing the hotel, they sit in notably different poses. Instead of sunglasses over his eyes, Saxon is reading a book on spirituality that Chelsea gave him. Instead of headphones over her ears, Piper smiles into the sun. And instead of a drink covering his mouth, Lochlan has shoved his hands into his pockets. One would forgive him if he never took a sip of any drink ever again. Chelsea and Rick die in the shootout he starts\n\nChelsea and Rick reunite, soon before they are forever united in death Courtesy of HBO\n\nIn the end, Chelsea was right. Bad things do happen in threes. If you almost die twice on vacation from an armed robbery and a snake bite, you should probably leave the resort. She was also right that her fate and Rick’s were intertwined. Rick, who seemingly found closure last episode after confronting the man he believed killed his father, hotel owner Jim Hollinger, doesn’t have the sense to leave the resort run by the man he just threatened with a gun. Jim confronts Rick at breakfast, where he insults Rick’s mother and tells him his father was a bad man. Rick, overcome with anger and unable to bump Zion from his session with Amrita for some emergency counseling, shoots Jim Hollinger, only to be informed by Jim’s wife Sritala that Jim was his father.\n\nJim’s bodyguards, it must be said, are awful at their jobs. I don’t know why they bullied Gaitok so much when they let Rick get away after threatening their boss with a gun in Bangkok and wandered away from Jim when they knew that same man was on the premises at the resort. Anyway, they finally jump into action after Rick shoots Jim. Chelsea gets killed in the crossfire, and a couple of the bodyguards end up taking what appear to be fatal gunshot wounds as well. (I wrote earlier this season that Rick and Chelsea were the healthiest couple we’d ever seen on The White Lotus. Admittedly, a low bar, but actors Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood were really playing up their true love for one another in the press. Mea culpa. Do not romanticize this relationship!) Rick grabs a bleeding-out Chelsea and staggers toward help, only for Gaitok, goaded on by Sritala and a week’s worth of negging from Mook, to shoot a defenseless Rick, clearly holding a wounded woman, in the back, killing him too. (More on Mook at Gaitok later.)\n\nThe White Lotus season 3 cast shares what makes this season so different than the others\n\nIn our run-up to the finale, my colleague Judy Berman and I made predictions about who would die and who would survive. And while I called the Darth Vader moment between Jim and Rick, Judy was the one to correctly predict Chelsea’s death. I must admit I had been skeptical. It all seemed so obvious. Chelsea said so many ominous things all season. She claimed bad things happened in threes, constantly repeated that she had a terrible feeling about what was going to happen, and (correctly) asserted multiple times that she had almost died on this vacation. Chloe fretted over Chelsea, telling her that all the girls she knew who were romantics wound up “heartbroken…or worse.” Chelsea and Rick insisting they would be together until the day they died repeatedly in the final episode had me worried that that day was coming sooner than either of them expected. Even the romantic lighting during Chelsea’s reunion with Rick read as inauspicious.\n\nBut Judy accurately observed that there were obvious signs pointing toward Tanya’s death in Season 2: A fortune teller basically telling her Greg was manipulating her; the story Tanya hears about a rich matriarch being killed for her house; the comparisons between her and tragic heroines in operas. Sometimes you just have to listen to what creator Mike White is telling you! Innocence is sacrificed\n\nGaitok, post-abandoning his principles to become a hotshot at work and in his love life Courtesy of HBO\n\nThe big takeaway from these murders and near-killings? When the powerful can’t find peace, they destroy the innocent in their orbit. Tim nearly kills his youngest child, the one struggling the most with his identity and arguably the most vulnerable, because he can’t make peace with the fact that he lost his family’s riches and therefore his own status among them. Rick directly causes the death of Chelsea, the bright light in his very dark life, because he cannot let go of his obsession with vengeance and his identity as a wronged man.\n\nOther seemingly innocent or morally righteous characters become corrupted too. Gaitok, of course, in a quest to please his love interest and his boss, defies his “What Would the Buddha Do?” mantra and murders an unarmed man. He is rewarded with Mook’s approval, a promotion, and some cool sunglasses because this is White Lotus after all. Similarly, Belinda not only decides to take Greg/Gary’s “blood money” but manages to negotiate up to $5 million dollars, mainly thanks to Zion’s MBA-inspired confidence. White has previously talked about Belinda as the morally irreproachable character on the show—but this series has basically no ethical characters, so of course Belinda gets her payday. In one sense, Zion is right and his mom should celebrate her much-deserved break. On the other hand… Belinda gets rich and becomes Tanya, sort of\n\nBelinda, now rich, pulls a Tanya on Pornchai Courtesy of HBO\n\nIn a way, Gary also strips Belinda of her innocence because he cannot find peace after Tanya’s death: He pays Belinda off, fundamentally and immediately altering her character. After Belinda makes bank, she goes to talk to her new lover, Pornchai. They had briefly discussed opening up a spa together in Thailand, fulfilling Belinda’s dream on an admittedly lower budget. But Belinda’s new influx of cash immediately transforms her. She tells Pornchai that her “circumstances have changed” and she can no longer go into business with him. The conversation is strikingly similar to the one that Tanya had with Belinda back in Season 1 after Tayna met Greg and decided to leave Hawaii. So Belinda has become Tanya, kind of. In fairness to Belinda, she always gave noncommittal answers to Pornchai’s questions about opening a spa together. (After all, she has a life and son in the U.S.) And Pornchai never drew up a business plan as Belinda did in Season 1. But the point stands: Belinda’s newfound wealth has had some kind of corrupting effect on her.\n\nThe blonde blob reconcile in a too-perfect moment\n\nLaurie has gotten something out of this vacation, or at leasts believes she has Courtesy of HBO\n\nI am not sure what to make of Laurie’s tearful toast to her traveling companions, who Mike White dubbed “the blonde blob” in reference to their similar hairstyles. Jaclyn slept with the man she was crushing on, and both Jaclyn and Kate blamed Laurie for her own misfortune. Laurie says that while she’s unhappy with her job, love life, and motherhood, that having held onto this friendship with her two oldest (and probably cattiest) companions gives her fulfillment. She's just happy to \"be at the table.\" And then they all cuddle on pool chairs. Sure, I guess? The idea that one can find meaning in mere survival rather than the traditional postmarks of success is a moving one. But I don't know that this speech is earned. I feel it’s more likely these women would either end their friendship after their blow up or return to their cold war soon after this faux makeup session. In the post-episode interview, White explains that Laurie needed to take some lesson from this terrible week in paradise. So perhaps her words were meant to ring a bit hollow.\n\nAlso, rewatch the shootout. When bullets start flying, Laurie books it leaving her friends in her wake. So maybe they don’t mean that much to her. This season’s flat girlfriend problem\n\nMook has been waiting for Gaitok to toughen up Courtesy of HBO\n\nI found myself increasingly frustrated with how flat both Mook and Chelsea felt all season. Mook expressed a singular desire in all her conversations with Gaitok: That he be more aggressive. Why she was interested in such a sweet, innocent boy if that’s her main turn-on, I’m not sure. We know nothing about her background or her other wants or desires. Similarly, while Aimee Lou Wood gave a standout performance as the doe-eyed Chelsea, the character trended spiritual pixie dream girl by the end of the season. Almost every conversation she had in the show was either with Rick or about Rick. If you were on vacation with someone constantly leaving to call their boyfriend who never answers his phone, you would tell them to break up with that boyfriend.\n\nChelsea briefly alludes to a pain in her past. I would have loved to have heard about it. We know nothing about her except that she is desperately in love with Rick and wants to care for the middle-aged man like he is her child. She’s a romantic, and Wood and Goggins are so compelling together as Chelsea and Rick that you want to root for them. But she must have had a job at some point? Or a family? Or friends? I really wanted more out of both of these women who ultimately seemed like props in a shootout—Chelsea the dead body to teach one man a lesson, and Mook a means of pushing another man to make a violent decision. Seriously, where are the police?\n\nScott Glenn in The White Lotus Fabio Lovino—HBO\n\nLook, I was willing to forgive the fact that Shane got away with murder and was still able to make his flight back to New York in Season 1, presumably claiming it was a random accident. I accepted that Greg changed his name to Gary and moved directly next to the same chain of resorts where his wife was killed, spending hundreds of millions of his dead wife’s money on a house, a yacht, and who knows what else without raising any red flags with authorities. But I will draw the line at the notion that the three friends who are witnesses to a murder in the morning make it onto their boat to leave the resort in the afternoon. I don’t care how famous Jaclyn is, they’re getting questioned by the police. (It also bears asking: Lochlan didn’t require a lick of medical attention after seeing God and nearly dying? Zion isn’t a bit more traumatized by encountering a dead body in the water?) Plus, if this hotel didn’t have a PR problem after the first two seasons, it has one now. The murders at this resort chain must be mentioned in Season 4.\n\nNothing from nothing\n\nRick, the architect of his own demise Courtesy of HBO\n\nRemember early in the season when Rick is in the counseling session with Amrita, and he insists that because his father died before he was born, he has no identity? “Nothing comes from nothing,” he says. Of course, Rick’s entire self-identity will turn out to be false. But the “nothing from nothing” assertion becomes something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Chelsea tells Rick to concentrate on the love he has, not the love he was denied. But Rick can’t focus on his many blessings and, as a result, destroys the one thing he loves. Nothing comes from a relationship he puts nothing into.\n\nFittingly, Billy Preston’s “Nothing From Nothing” plays at the end of the show. Note the lyric, “You’ve gotta have something, if you want to be with me.” That could apply to Rick and Chelsea—had he given her something spiritually, perhaps they would have survived together. But in a more cynical and capitalistic sense, that could also be Victoria’s motto (she needs wealth) or even Mook’s (she needs a macho guy).\n\nSpeaking of musical choices, a season rooted in eastern religion and spirituality plays what sounds like a church choir over the final moments of the show. The westerners who went to Thailand seeking some kind of spiritual enlightenment clearly didn’t find anything there that radically changed their previously-held worldviews. Though it would be interesting to check back in with Saxon in a few months and see how his eastern religion curriculum is progressing.",

    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "The U.S. and global stock markets have been hit hard since President Donald Trump announced his latest tariffs on April 2. The so-called “Liberation Day” saw the introduction of blanket 10% tariffs on all imported goods, and additional import taxes placed on 60 other countries. In the worst week for U.S. stocks since the markets crashed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Dow Jones closed on Friday 2,000 points down, the S&P Index plunged 6%, and Nasdaq dipped almost 6%.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe volatility of the market has risen significantly, causing concern from investors and businesses alike, and sparking fresh fears that the U.S. may be heading into a recession. Read More: Is the U.S. Heading Into a Recession Amid Trump’s Tariffs? ‘Liberation Day’ Fallout Sparks Fresh Fears There has also been a surge in concerns being voiced by people worried about the impact on their 401(k), as many have noticed a dip in their investments.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about how the economic turmoil resulting from Trump’s tariffs will affect your 401(k) and what you should do moving forward. How is your 401(k) affected by the tariffs?\n\nA 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan where a person has the option to make contributions that are deducted from their paycheck. In some cases, the company will match your contributions up to a certain percentage of your salary. The value of 401(k) accounts is closely tied to fluctuations in the stock markets, as the portfolio allows you to invest in assets which are directly tied to the market’s performance. As such, when the stock market fluctuates, so too does a 401(k). With a 401(k), you carry all the risk because the investment decisions are yours. With such extreme dips in the stock market, some Americans are seeing their retirement savings take an intense hit. During an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, April 6, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was asked about the market turmoil and the concerns regarding retirement savings. Host Kristen Welker said: “More than 160 million Americans are invested in the market. Many of them have spent their lives saving for their retirement. What is your message to Americans who want to retire right now and who've just seen their lifetime savings drop significantly?”\n\nResponding to the question, Bessent remarked that he thinks it's a “false narrative,” and suggested that people maintain a “long-term view.” “Americans who want to retire right now, Americans who have put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what's happening. And you know, in fact, most Americans don't have everything in the market,” said Bessent. “Most Americans in a 401(k) have what's called a '60/40 account.' 60/40 accounts are down 5 or 6% on the year. People have a long-term view. They have a program that the reason the stock market is considered a good investment is because it's a long-term investment. If you look day-to-day, week-to-week, it's very risky. Over the long term, it's a good investment.” Bessent's remarks mirror those made by Trump. On April 3, when aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked by a reporter about the rising concerns among Americans and whether he has checked his own 401(k) since his tariff announcements stunned the stock market.\n\nTrump said: “I haven’t checked my 401(k).” The President also doubled down on his belief that though the markets look bad now, his tariffs will ultimately be a good thing for the economy. “I think our markets are going to boom; we’ve got to give it a little chance,” he said. The President once again shared his optimism about the economy in an update he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Saturday, April 5. “This is an economic revolution, and we will win. Hang tough, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will Make America Great Again,” he said. Read More: Why Economists Are Horrified by Trump’s Tariff Math However, experts have their concerns. Teresa Fort, associate professor of business administration at Dartmouth, says: “The U.S. market has outperformed everywhere for the last couple of decades, but I don’t know if it’s clear that this is going to continue… the entire world economic order has been shifted, and people are going to need to rethink what [their] optimal allocations should be.”\n\nWhat do experts advise you should do about your 401(k)? Brad Clark, founder and CEO of Solomon Financial, says that this is not the time to panic and take your money out of savings. “It’s scary,” he admits, but the response to fear, in his professional opinion, is to stay the course—especially if you are a younger investor preparing for future retirement. “When you're flying somewhere and you're in the worst turbulence you've ever been in, all you can think is, ‘I've just got to get off this plane,’” says Clark. “But the plane was built to handle this. That's kind of like your portfolio.” For people two or three years from retirement, Clark says their portfolios should already be less risky, and they should not have full market exposure to their investments. However, for those who are still 10 or more years away from retirement, there could be positives to note. “What a great buying opportunity,” Clark argues. “This is how the Warren Buffetts of the world make money. Greedy when everyone else is fearful, and fearful when everyone else is greedy.”\n\nClark’s advice to those people—who are a decade or more away from retirement— is to “continue to invest like you’ve always invested,” and he is confident that this will pay off in the long run. In a column for the Washington Post, personal finance columnist and author Michelle Singletary echoed this sentiment. “If you’re in your 20s, 30s, or early 40s, don’t let what’s happening now scare you away from the stock market. Keep investing,” she said. Read More: How to Prepare For the New Social Security ID Policy Ahead of Its Initiation in April Laurence Kotlikoff, professor of economics at Boston University, takes a more cautious approach for people of all ages. He recommends not investing in anything risky now, instead starting back from a safe investment position and eventually building your investment portfolio back into something more risky. By starting conservatively and building up, Kotlikoff says that investors can save themselves from pain later on.\n\n“There’s no reason to believe that the market will reverse itself,” he says. “Leave only in the market what you can afford to lose and don’t spend outside of it.” He also recommends people consider doing what he and his wife did soon after Trump’s Inauguration Day. In preparation of potential market fluctuations, they built a TIPS ladder, which is a portfolio of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. TIPS are U.S. government bonds that adjust for inflation, ensuring that the bond’s principal increases with inflation and decreases with deflation. “It's a combination of spending and investing behavior that is called ‘upside investing’ that leads you just to have upside risks,” Kotlikoff says. “You're losing that downside because you're never spending out of anything that's risky, you’re just spending out of this TIPS ladder.” Fort echoes Kotlikoff’s caution, noting that while some economists are saying to stay the course as usual, these are not usual times, and she thinks that it is likely that the markets are only going to dip further. For her own mother, who relies on her 401k, Fort has reduced her exposure to the market as much as possible.\n\n“This is a fundamental shift in the world order,” Fort emphasizes once more. “If you are close to retirement age, you’ll want to look for the safest assets if you cannot afford another 20% to 30% decline in the market.”\n\nOverall, it's worth noting that expert advice varies depending on the age of the person with the 401(k) and what stage they're at in their working lives. For example, Fort did not take the same measures for her own financial portfolio as she did for her mother's, since she is younger and has more time until retirement. Across the board, expert guidance tells us not to panic and not to make any rash financial decisions.",

    "title": "Michelle Zauner Stares Down the Darkness",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "Michelle Zauner wants to set the record straight: She is not trying to reclaim the label “sad girl music.” Since announcing the title of her highly anticipated fourth studio album, For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), the author, director, and front woman of indie-pop band Japanese Breakfast has been surprised to see how divisive the title has become, and the assumptions it’s given way to. Some thought she was writing a collection of sad breakup songs; others that she was taking ownership of a label that has previously been wielded with the intent to belittle or insult.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I think [the album title] was a little bit tongue-in-cheek,” Zauner says with a chuckle over Zoom in early February. “And it was maybe taken very literally.” “Sad girl music” is a fraught subject, and Zauner chooses her words carefully. “I don’t want to get into trouble,” she says, explaining that a lot of brilliant women songwriters get unfairly punted into that category. And it’s true: the music industry and the internet have made a nasty habit of reducing songwriting by women that deals with complex emotions in this way—Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski, and Lana Del Rey have had to fend off these degrading designations for years.\n\nZauner, though, is interested to see what people will say once they’ve had a listen to the project in its entirety. With the album due March 21, Zauner, 35, finds herself in a constant state of “caring, then not caring, and then pretending to care.” Her mood matches the weather outside our windows: “I’m a winter person in the sense that I feel like I must suffer through something to enjoy the coming season,” she says and laughs heartily. The stakes feel high after her past few years. For Melancholy Brunettes arrives four years after Zauner’s rise from indie-music darling to literary heavyweight with the release of her wildly successful, gut-punching memoir Crying in H Mart, which explored her Korean American identity and her relationship with her late mother Chongmi, who died of cancer in 2014. Written in arresting, empathetic prose, it became an instant New York Times best seller and is currently in its 39th printing.\n\nRead More: Michelle Zauner Is on the 2022 TIME 100 List Zauner followed up Crying in H Mart with Japanese Breakfast’s third studio album, Jubilee. Unlike the book, the album took a sharp turn away from grief into cathartic joy, blending dreamy synth-pop chords with shoe-gaze sensibilities. It was equally met with critical success, earning the group nominations for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album at the 2022 Grammys. For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), though, is worlds away from the sonic landscape of Jubilee. It’s not quite in the sphere of Crying in H Mart, either. Here, Zauner is exploring something bleaker—crueler and more punishing. She’s trying to see what darkness, of all different kinds, looks like when you stare it right in the face.\n\nWhen I ask what comes to mind when Zauner thinks of melancholy brunettes, she excitedly whips out her phone to rattle off some references: Paintings like L’Absinthe by Edgar Degas, Tired by Ramón Casas, and The Wedding Dress by Frederick Elwell—all interpretations of women experiencing massive despair—were hugely informative to the record. They were especially important to the album art, which sees Zauner looking like a gothic, Brontëesque character, face down on a table surrounded by a plentiful feast. “I like the idea of being someone just collapsed on a table, surrounded by a wealth of goods. Like a spoiled prince or something,” she explains.\n\nWhen Zauner began writing For Melancholy Brunettes in the winter of 2022, she was clear that she wanted to do something from a more introspective place. She wanted to write songs that were also more guitar-focused, compared to Jubilee’s lush horns and slinky synths, and teamed up with producer Blake Mills (who, among his vast repertoire of acts, has worked with other virtuosic rock acts like Fiona Apple, Perfume Genius, and Alabama Shakes) to record the album at Sound City in Los Angeles—making it the band’s first proper studio release after working on their first three records with friends in makeshift recording studios. As she began piecing the songs together, Zauner was also reading—a lot. She wanted to explore how the concept of melancholy has evolved in stories of love and longing, society and familial relationships over time. She worked her way from European Romanticism to Greek mythology before turning to Gothic Romance classics like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Frankenstein, and even modernist staples like The Magic Mountain by German author Thomas Mann, which is her husband and fellow bandmate Peter Bradley’s favorite book and directly inspired a song on the album.\n\nShe also became increasingly fascinated with works “that could be categorized as part of the incel canon,” Zauner says—books that the mostly male subculture of self-described “involuntary celibates” has glorified for their depiction of loneliness and manhood—think American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Zauner hoped to better understand why this type of “confused masculinity” and Joker-like anger and loneliness emerges; how these aggrieved and occasionally violent men process the world. “If I look back at my very early work, it’s always been [there]—this fear of men,” she says. “There is this disappointment and fear of men, and these creepy stories—like an ominous thing has happened or is about to happen—that threads the songs together.”\n\nZauner, second from right, performs with Japanese Breakfast Todd Owyoung—NBC/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, listening to the new album feels not unlike you’re Cathy (or Heathcliff) staring at the misty English moors, as impending doom envelops you from all angles: On “Honey Water,” a woman finds herself in a marriage to a slimy, unfaithful man, and equates him to a thirsty bug. On “Mega Circuit,” a lustful spectator watches a gang of incels meander around over a feverish, sinister guitar shuffle. On “Little Girl,” perhaps one of the most devastating ballads on the record, a father, urinating in a corner of a lonely hotel room, wonders how he became estranged from his daughter. (“Seven years of running at this breakneck speed/ Convalescing cheaply far abroad/ Dreaming of a daughter who won’t speak to me/ Running for her father coming home.”) Dramatic as they may seem, these sentiments are strikingly relatable—feelings of yearning and amorphous despair on an album releasing in the middle of a public-health crisis of loneliness.\n\nThe lyrics, the storytelling, the sparse, meticulous melodies—it’s all so beautifully punishing, and that is exactly the point.\n\nAfter her mom died, Zauner says, she “became very work-obsessed.” While work was a grounding force, it came at a cost: “I kind of lost track of any form of self-care or personal life, or family and friends.” Following the release of Crying in H Mart and then Jubilee (and a much-needed sabbatical in Korea), Zauner found herself thinking about what it means to be a creative working woman in her mid-30s—the price one pays for their ambitions. It was playing on Zauner’s mind a lot as she was making For Melancholy Brunettes, especially when she thought about balancing her work with expanding her family. “There is this anticipatory grief about wanting to become a mother and having to reckon with the creative loss that that will usher in,” Zauner says. “I was thinking about how much I’ve excused men for poor behavior because of their positions of power and the work that they’ve had to do to provide for their family.” Now, as Zauner has grown into her creative career, she questions the elusive balancing act between the “narcissism that comes with being an artist and [the desire to be] a good human being.”\n\nIt’s what drew her to write the album’s lead single, “Orlando in Love.” Inspired by John Cheever’s nod to Orlando Innamorato, an unfinished epic poem by the Renaissance poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, the song is a story about “a foolish, romantic guy” who succumbs to a siren’s call, and in some ways, Zauner’s personal reflection on success. “You’re pursuing your dreams in a very foolhardy way, and sometimes you’re punished for just how straight you’re going with it,” she says. “Like, if you go too far in your ambitions, it likely will not end well.”\n\nThe 2025 Grammys happened a week before Zauner and I spoke, and the internet was still buzzing not only from Beyoncé’s finally winning Album of the Year, but another artist who unequivocally spoke their mind that night: Chappell Roan. Roan, who received the Grammy for Best New Artist, got up to the podium and called out the record industry for not supporting emerging artists with necessities like a livable wage and health insurance. When Zauner heard this, she immediately took to X to congratulate Roan, writing, “f-ck ya Chappell!!!!!” That got her in a bit of trouble: some people interpreted “ya” to mean an insulting “you” instead of an enthusiastic “yes.” Zauner couldn’t believe it.\n\nRead More: Leave Chappell Roan Alone\n\n“Let the record show that I thought it was amazing, and I think it’s so ridiculous how much crap she has to endure for all of the good that she’s putting into the world. She inspires me to be a more outspoken, braver artist,” Zauner says. Having been nominated in the same category, she finds it a bit funny that these award shows so aggressively avoid naming the problems that plague the same industry they are celebrating. But Roan, she says, “very eloquently and very courageously said exactly what the problem is.”\n\nPerhaps that’s what For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women) is trying to do, too. Naming the problem—and hoping that despite the scars, the battle wounds, the punishment, and the castigations, we’ll all come out the other end into the light.",

    "content": "Wednesday was “liberation day” in the U.S. as President Trump took to the White House Rose Garden to announce tariffs on U.S. allies and competitors alike. Like clockwork, traders sold off stock in markets across the globe, and economists warned that inflation will be higher than anticipated a few months ago. The likelihood of a recession has grown. It would be understandable for a climate concerned person to fear that economic headwinds will be yet another force that slows climate action. Indeed, it’s inevitable that this chaotic moment for markets will push executives to train their eyes on stopping financial bleeding. But that doesn’t mean that businesses will deprioritize or cancel their climate programs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOver the past few years, many firms have transitioned their environmental commitments from long-shot investments or marketing schemes to financially motivated efforts with short-term returns. The economic anxiety ahead poses a crucial test. Has understanding of sustainability’s financial opportunity grown such that companies lean into their climate work, or will executives slip into thinking that climate programs are simply too expensive? The textbook first thing that businesses do in response to economic uncertainty is to protect their balance sheet to hold onto as much money as possible for a rainy day down the road. There was a time when climate programs might have seemed like easy things to cut to save money, but that’s not how things are situated today. In the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, companies very publicly doubled down on measures aimed at addressing climate change and investors poured funds into so-called ESG funds (short for environmental, social and governance). Just as the zero interest rate era fueled bold and often nonsensical investments, so too did the trillions in ESG dollars lead companies to make aggressive environmental commitments that, in some cases, were untethered from financial reality.\n\nThe last few years have forced companies to get serious. Some have looked under the hood and determined that they, in fact, can’t meet their targets, leading them to backtrack. Others have doubled down with an understanding that sustainability programs can help the bottomline. Every company and every sector is different, but the most obvious value of sustainability initiatives in a moment of economic uncertainty is efficiency. Simply put: efficiency brings down costs—and emissions. Read more: Why Investing in Climate Action During a Recession Is a Smart Business Move The other textbook recession advice to businesses is that well-positioned firms should look for opportunities for strategic investment. Study after study has shown that strategic investment during a recession—while some competitors are cutting wantonly—positions companies to outperform when economic conditions normalize. For forward thinking firms, climate and sustainability is an area ripe for strategic investment. Companies are increasingly facing the real costs of climate change—from facilities hit by extreme weather to supply chain disruptions—which will need to be addressed. And, while the regulatory pressures have faded in the U.S., climate rules remain significant and growing in many of the key geographies around the world, meaning that multinational companies still need to pay attention to sustainability.\n\nIf this all sounds a little too optimistic, it’s worth looking at what happened during the past two economic downturns. In 2011, as the global economy was still recovering from the Great Recession, a widely cited paper from researchers at Harvard Business School found that “high sustainability” firms financially outperformed their “low sustainability” counterparts over the previous 20 years including the recent downturn. Then in 2020, as the world recovered from the COVID-induced recession, trillions flowed into funds that claimed to prioritize ESG. Of course, there is one elephant in the room that makes circumstances slightly different in this case: the economic certainty today is entirely the result of U.S. policy. In this column, I deliberately avoided trying to parse out the specific impacts of Trump’s tariff regime. While there is some good early analysis out there already, it is too soon to tell exactly how the new taxes will reshape the global clean technology supply chain—even if we know that a reshaping is inevitable.\n\nAmid all of this, the companies that find ways to make climate action financially advantageous may not only weather this storm but emerge positioned for long-term success in a world where both climate impacts and climate solutions continue to reshape markets.\n\n(To get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.)",

    "content": "Protesters across the U.S. came together on Saturday, April 5, for the nationwide “Hands Off!” protests, demonstrating resistance against the actions of President Donald Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) lead, Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The Trump Administration and Musk have notably spent the first few weeks of Trump’s presidency working to “reduce waste” through mass government layoffs and the termination of contracts. There has even been an attempt to dismantle the Department of Education. A child attending a protest in Atlanta was pictured holding a banner that read \"Hands off my education.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCities across the globe mobilized for their own Hands Off! protests, with various grassroots advocacy groups prioritizing concerns such as LGBTQ+ rights, immigrant rights, and climate activism. One woman at the Washington D.C. rally on the National Mall was pictured holding a sign that read “Stop Destroying America.” On the West Coast, demonstrators in Los Angeles marched from Pershing Square to City Hall.\n\nDemonstrators gather on the National Mall for the nationwide \"Hands Off!\" protest in Washington, D.C., on April 5, 2025. Amid Farahi—Getty Images\n\nThe demands of the protest, according to instructions from Hands Off!, called for an “end to the billionaire takeover” at the Trump Administration and “an end to the attacks on immigrants, trans people, and other communities.”\n\nOn the day, protesters also referenced Trump’s moves to dismantle climate action and the cutting of federal funding for certain health programs. Addressing the subject of the mass April 5 protests, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was quoted as telling USA TODAY in a statement: “Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years. President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers across the country who overwhelmingly re-elected him.” Meanwhile, in a statement issued to the Associated Press, the White House said: “President Trump’s position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats’ stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.”\n\nTrump spent part of his Saturday golfing in Florida, and has yet to publicly address the protests himself. TIME has reached out to the White House for comment.

In a statement shared via X (formerly Twitter), she said: \"Today in every state across our nation, Americans are standing up to the administration as they implement Project 2025 at full speed.\" Her message continued: \"Thank you for using your voices and the power of protest to stand for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; for the Department of Education and programs like Head Start; for clean air and water; for the right to make decisions about your own body without government interference. The voices of working people will always be louder than the unelected billionaires.\"\n\nTrump has always maintained he has no involvement with Project 2025.\n\nProtesters gather in front of the U.S. embassy in Berlin, Germany, on April 5, 2025. Halil Sagirkaya—Getty Images\n\nAccording to a toolkit put together for those who wished to host their own version of the march, the purpose was to present a “massive, visible, national rejection of this crisis.” The protests came at a precarious time, as the U.S. stock market plummeted following Trump’s latest tariffs which he announced on April 2, a day he called “Liberation Day.” Read More: Is Your 401(k) Affected by Trump’s Tariffs?

In Berlin, protesters gathered outside the U.S. embassy, with one woman pictured holding up a sign that read: “Hands off our Social Security.” This was in reference to the ongoing concerns as to what might happen to Social Security under the Trump Administration.\n\nIn London, one person held up a sign that read “Hands off Europe.” Another banner said “Greenland is not for sale,” in reference to Trump’s interest in buying Greenland from Denmark.",

    "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israel struck tents outside two major hospitals in the Gaza Strip overnight, killing at least two people, including a local reporter, and wounding another nine, including six reporters, medics said Monday. Fifteen others were killed in separate strikes across the territory, according to hospitals. A strike on a media tent outside Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis at around 2 a.m. set the tent ablaze, killing Yousef al-Faqawi, a reporter for the Palestine Today news website, and another man, according to the hospital. The six reporters were wounded in that strike.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck a Hamas militant, without providing further information. The military says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths because it is deeply embedded in residential areas. Israel also struck tents on the edge of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah, wounding three people, according to the hospital. Nasser Hospital said it received another 13 bodies, including six women and four children, from separate strikes overnight. Al-Aqsa Hospital said two people were killed and three wounded in a strike on a home in Deir al-Balah. Israel has carried out waves of strikes across Gaza and ground forces have carved out new military zones since it ended its ceasefire with Hamas last month. Israel has barred the import of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid since the beginning of March. Thousands of people have sheltered in tents set up inside hospital compounds throughout the 18-month war, assuming Israel would be less likely to target them.\n\nIsrael has raided hospitals on several occasions, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes, allegations denied by hospital staff. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, rampaging through army bases and farming communities and killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. They abducted 251 people, and are still holding 59 captives — 24 of whom are believed to be alive — after most of the rest were released in ceasefires or other deals. Israel has vowed to keep escalating military pressure until Hamas releases the remaining hostages, lays down its arms and leaves the territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will then implement U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to resettle much of Gaza's population to other countries through what the Israeli leader refers to as “voluntary emigration.” Palestinians say they do not want to leave their homeland, and human rights experts have warned that implementing the Trump proposal would likely amount to mass expulsion in violation of international law.\n\nNetanyahu will meet with Trump in Washington on Monday to discuss Gaza and other issues.\n\nIsrael's military offensive has killed over 50,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants or civilians. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nThe offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and at its height displaced around 90% of its population.\n\n___\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.",

    "title": "How the World’s Reacting to Trump’s Latest Tariffs",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "Donald Trump’s promised “Liberation Day” was originally planned for Tuesday, April 1, until the President told reporters last month he pushed it back 24 hours so it wouldn’t be viewed as an April Fool’s joke. “Nobody would believe what I said,” he explained. Perhaps he knew that his announcement on Wednesday, April 2, would sound a bit ridiculous—but everyone is certainly taking it seriously now. Trump announced “reciprocal” tariffs on imports from nearly every nation on earth—allies and adversaries alike—in a move that is expected to rock the U.S. economy and will upend global trade.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSeveral world leaders have already pushed back against the latest tariffs—which were set at a minimum of 10% and rise as high as 50% for the hardest-hit countries—some promising swift countermeasures that could effectively force economies everywhere to become more insular, others asking for an opportunity to negotiate to avoid all-out trade war. Here’s a rundown of the responses so far. Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday that Trump’s tariffs “have no basis in logic and they go against the basis” of the diplomatic alliance between Australia and the U.S. “This is not the act of a friend,” Albanese said, adding that Australia does not plan to retaliate with its own tariffs against the U.S. Brazil Brazil, which was hit with a 10% tariff, passed a reciprocity bill on Wednesday allowing it to retaliate against tariffs imposed on Brazilian goods by any country or trade bloc. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva earlier said it was considering appealing to the World Trade Organization over Trump’s steel tariffs.\n\n“The new measure, like the tariffs already imposed on the steel, aluminum, and automobile sectors, violates the United States’ commitments to the World Trade Organization and will impact all Brazilian exports of goods to the United States,” Brazil’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “The Brazilian government is evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization, in defense of legitimate national interests.” Cambodia The Minister of Labour and Vocational Training for Cambodia, which was slammed with one of the highest “reciprocal” tariff rates at 49%, said the country will be able to manage the consequences of the U.S. tariffs, despite concerns. Heng Sour said on Thursday that the tariff increase “is not politically motivated nor intended as a sanction against Cambodia,” adding that several other Asian countries were hit with similarly high rates. “Therefore, the tariff impact on Cambodia’s production costs is not significantly more severe compared to other competing countries.”\n\n“However, by 2027,” Heng Sour warned, “we may face challenges if the U.S. eases tariffs on other countries, but Cambodia [does] not see such reductions.” China China, which was slapped with a 34% reciprocal tariff on top of existing 20% tariffs on Chinese imports, vowed to impose its own countermeasures. “China urges the U.S. to immediately revoke its unilateral tariff measures and work with trading partners to resolve differences through fair and constructive dialogue,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement in Chinese on Wednesday night. The reciprocal tariffs “violate international trade rules, infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other parties, and represent an act of unilateral bullying,” the ministry added. “There are no winners in a trade war, and protectionism is not a viable path forward.” A foreign ministry spokesperson also echoed the commerce ministry on Thursday, saying of Trump’s tariffs: “This gravely violates WTO rules, and undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system. China firmly rejects this and will do what is necessary to defend our legitimate rights and interests.”\n\nRead More: Chinese State Media Rebuke Trump’s Tariffs With AI Song and Videos Colombia Colombian President Gustavo Petro posted on X on Thursday: “Today, neoliberalism, which proclaimed a free trade policy across the globe, is dead. … The US government now believes that by raising tariffs on its imports in general, it can increase its own production, wealth, and employment; in my opinion, this may be a big mistake.” Petro added that Colombia and other Latin American countries could benefit from Trump’s tariffs—and that Colombia will take a nuanced approach to any potential countermeasures. “Colombian businesses must know how to take advantage of opportunities. Agro-industrial and semi-industrial products from countries outside Latin America are becoming more expensive in US markets, and if we can produce these goods more cheaply, it's time to export them there,” he wrote. “We will only make US imports more expensive if they take away our jobs. But we won’t raise tariffs if their goods help create higher-value jobs.”\n\nE.U. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement on Wednesday that the European Union is finalizing a package of countermeasures in response to Trump’s previously imposed 25% levy on steel—which is exempt from additional reciprocal tariffs—and is now preparing further countermeasures against Trump’s 20% reciprocal tariffs on the E.U. “We have always been ready to negotiate with the U.S., to remove any remaining barriers to Transatlantic trade,” von der Leyen said. “At the same time, we are prepared to respond … to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail.” Trump’s universal tariffs are a “major blow to the world economy,” von der Leyen added. “Let’s be clear-eyed about the immense consequences. The global economy will massively suffer. Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe.”\n\n“All businesses—big and small—will suffer from day one,” von der Leyen said. “From greater uncertainty to the disruption of supply chains to burdensome bureaucracy.” Fiji Fiji’s Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad said Thursday in a statement that the tariffs are “disproportionate” and “unfair.” Fiji was hit with a 32% tariff to counter the island nation’s supposed 63% tariff on U.S. goods—a White House-produced figure that Prasad rejects. Prasad said 97% of U.S. imports are either duty-free or subject to a minimal 5% tariff. France France denounced Trump’s tariffs, with government spokesperson Sophie Primas telling RTL radio on Thursday that Trump is behaving as though he is “master of the world.” Primas said, CNBC reported, that the E.U. will likely implement countermeasures as a bloc in mid-April and again in late April. Germany German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Trump’s latest tariffs an “attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world” at a news conference on Thursday. He added that the E.U. would respond proportionately if negotiations fail.\n\n“The E.U. has the strongest internal market in the world with 450 million consumers, which gives us the strength to hold talks with the U.S. government to avert a trade war,” Scholz said. “We want cooperation, not confrontation, and will defend our interests. Europe will respond united, strong and proportionately to this decision.” In a Thursday statement, the Federation of German Industries, the country’s largest industry lobby group, called on the E.U. to “strengthen its alliances with other major trading partners and should coordinate its reaction with them. A coordinated reaction is also necessary to counter diversionary effects in international trade.” German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Thursday: “For U.S. consumers, this will be Inflation Day, rather than Liberation Day.” India India’s Commerce and Trade Ministry said in a statement Thursday that they will “remain in touch” with the U.S. regarding Trump’s latest tariffs. India, which was hit with 26% tariffs, has a relative advantage, research firm Global Trade Research Institute told Reuters, compared with other Asian nations that were slapped with even higher levies.\n\nThe statement added that “discussions are ongoing between Indian and U.S. trade teams for the expeditious conclusion of a mutually beneficial, multi-sectoral Bilateral Trade Agreement.” Ireland In a Wednesday statement, Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin said: “We see no justification for this. More than €4.2 billion worth of goods and services are traded between the E.U. and the U.S. daily. Disrupting this deeply integrated relationship benefits no one. Tariffs drive inflation, hurt people on both sides of the Atlantic, and put jobs at risk.” Martin added that he has spoken with von der Leyen and agrees that a coordinated E.U. response is “crucial.” Israel Israel Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told reporters on Thursday that he would convene officials to “analyse opportunities and risks and formulate courses of action, both in relation to President Trump and his team and regarding the necessary steps to strengthen Israel's industry,” according to Reuters. The finance minister added the new 17% “reciprocal” tariff could impact Israel’s exports of machinery and medical equipment.\n\nIsrael, a U.S. ally, had cancelled its remaining tariffs on its U.S. imports on Tuesday, ahead of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs rollout, believing, according to a joint statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his ministers, that it would “further strengthen the alliance and ties between Israel and the United States.” Italy Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni posted on Facebook on Wednesday night that tariffs would hurt all parties. She added that Italy will negotiate a deal with the U.S. to “prevent a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global actors.” Japan Japan’s Trade Minister Yoji Muto said in a press conference on Thursday that he met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick just before Trump’s announcement to urge Japan’s exemption from the tariffs. After the announcement, which did not exempt but instead levied a “reciprocal” tariff rate of 24% on Japan, a long-standing ally of the U.S., Muto called the move “extremely regrettable.”\n\nAsked if Japan would retaliate, Muto said: “We need to decide what is best for Japan, and most effective, in a careful but bold and speedy manner.” He added that Japan’s trade ministry will closely analyze the impacts of the tariffs. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said later Thursday that it was “very disappointing that these measures were taken despite our requests,” according to Bloomberg. Ishiba had said the previous week that Japan would put “all options on the table” in responding to tariffs: “Japan is a country that is making the largest amount of investment to the United States, so we wonder if it makes sense for [the U.S.] to apply uniform tariffs to all countries. That is a point we’ve been making and will continue to do so.” Ishiba said Thursday he would urge the U.S. to reconsider and added: “If it’s appropriate to do so I won’t hesitate at all to directly talk to President Trump.” Speaking to reporters at the Prime Minister’s Office, Ishiba added that the tariffs “will have a tremendous impact not only on economic relations between Japan and the U.S., but also the global economy as a whole.”\n\nMalaysia Malaysia, which was hit with a 24% “reciprocal” tariff by Trump, has ruled out imposing retaliatory tariffs, the country’s Ministry of Investment, Trade & Industry said in a Thursday statement. The country’s National Geoeconomic Command Centre, the statement said, will “evaluate the impact of this recent US announcement and will consider a comprehensive and multipronged strategy to mitigate the effects of these tariffs on our economy and industries,” while the country uses the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, a preexisting trade pact between the U.S. and other countries including Malaysia, to “seek reciprocal trade gains and pursue a Technology Safeguards Agreement” with the U.S. “Malaysia strongly believes in constructive engagement for mutually beneficial economic relations,” the statement added. “MITI is committed to safeguarding Malaysia’s economic interests and maintaining strong trade relations with the U.S.”\n\nNew Zealand New Zealand’s Trade Minister Todd McClay disputed the Trump Administration’s claim that it imposed 20% tariffs on U.S. imports, but McClay said New Zealand had no plans to retaliate to the new “reciprocal” tariffs imposed by the U.S. “We are a low tariff country and we have benefitted from it,” the country’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said. “What we wouldn’t want to do is raise prices here in New Zealand and add to inflation here in New Zealand by [imposing retaliatory tariffs].” Luxon added that while tariffs are “not the way to go,” New Zealand, which now faces a 10% U.S. tariff, is in a better position to trade with the U.S. relative to countries hit with harsher levies. “The bigger worry,” he said, “will be the global impact and the wash up of the tit-for-tat trade wars that may ensue.” Norfolk Island George Plant, the Administrator of Norfolk Island, an Australian territory in the Pacific for which Trump announced a “reciprocal” tariff rate of 29%, told the Associated Press on Thursday: “To my knowledge, we do not export anything to the United States.” Plant added: “We don’t charge tariffs on anything. I can’t think of any non-tariff barriers that would be in place either, so we’re scratching our heads here.”\n\nNorway Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told broadcaster NRK on Wednesday that Trump’s tariffs will “have consequences for many Norwegian companies and for jobs.” Norway is facing a 15% levy on exports to the U.S., which is “bad news” for a country that “lives off exports,” Støre said. Around 8% of mainland Norwegian exports go to the U.S., which is the country’s third largest export market, NRK reported. Støre said Norway is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. Poland Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk posted on X on Wednesday after Trump’s announcement, which included a tariff rate of 20% on the E.U., of which Poland is a member: “Friendship means partnership. Partnership means really and truly reciprocal tariffs. Adequate decisions are needed.” Several hours later, Tusk posted in Polish that the new tariffs may reduce Polish GDP by 0.4%. “A severe and unpleasant blow, because it comes from the closest ally, but we will survive it,” he added, while noting that the “friendship” between the U.S. and Poland “must also survive this test.”\n\nPhilippines Presidential office spokesperson Claire Castro told reporters in Manila on Thursday that the Southeast Asian country currently does not have details on which industries will be affected by the new 17% tariff imposed by Trump. Castro suggested the impact is not that “huge,” according to the country’s trade department. She added: “We also believe in the good relations of the U.S.-Philippine alliance, so the imposition of 17% may have been studied well enough by the U.S. administration so we will accept it.” Singapore Hit by Trump’s universal 10% tariff, Singapore was spared harsher tariffs that hit many of its neighbors. Still, the country’s Monetary Authority said on Thursday it is “ready to curb excessive volatility in the Singapore dollar, and to ensure that Singapore’s foreign exchange and money markets continue to function in an orderly manner.” Chua Hak Bin, co-head of macro research at Maybank, told the Straits Times that while Singapore was partly shielded by its free trade agreement with the U.S. and bilateral trade deficit, the country would still be “impacted from the massive deflationary shock to demand and trade. Manufacturing and exports will likely turn lower and contract in the coming quarters.”\n\nSouth Korea South Korea’s acting President Han Duck-soo convened a meeting with top officials on Thursday to assess the tariffs, according to a statement issued by its industry ministry. “As the global trade war has become a reality, the government must pour all its capabilities to overcome the trade crisis,” Han told the ministers. Han added that the government will prepare emergency support measures for industries and companies affected by the tariffs and ordered the industry minister to negotiate with Washington to minimize the impact. Spain Spain’s Economic Minister Carlos Cuerpo said Wednesday: “The European Union has the necessary tools to respond to [Trump’s tariffs], and, of course, in this context, Europe will not be naive. We will always respond.” Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summoned industry leaders on Thursday to a presentation of his response plan. Sweden Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in a Wednesday statement that Sweden is “well prepared for what’s happening now.” At the same time, he underscored: “We don’t want growing trade barriers. We don’t want a trade war. That would make our populations poorer and the world more dangerous in the long run.”\n\n“Free enterprise and competition have laid the foundations of the West’s success. That’s why Americans can listen to music on Swedish Spotify and we Swedes can listen to the same music on our American iPhones,” Kristersson said. He added that, as part of the E.U., Sweden will “take every opportunity to reverse these developments” and “contain the new U.S. tariffs.” Switzerland Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter posted on X on Wednesday that the Swiss government will “quickly determine the next steps.” Switzerland was hit with a 31% tariff. “The country’s long-term economic interests are paramount. Adherence to international law and free trade remain core values,” she added. Economiesuisse, a business federation representing around 100,000 companies in Switzerland, also posted on X on Wednesday night that U.S. tariffs are “harmful and unfounded.” “A further escalation of the trade conflict must be prevented,” the group warned. “The Federal Council and Swiss economic diplomacy are called upon to quickly find solutions at the negotiating table with the US government.”\n\nTaiwan Taiwan’s cabinet called Trump’s tariffs—which stood at 32% on Taiwanese goods—“deeply unreasonable” and “highly regrettable.” Cabinet spokesperson Michelle Lee said the government would negotiate with the U.S. to “ensure the interests of our nation and industries.” Prior to Trump’s announcement, Taiwan’s Minister of Economic Affairs J.W. Kuo said an economic and trade task force established last November has been working to determine what the effects of Trump’s tariffs would be and how the government should respond. After the U.S. previously announced tariffs on the semiconductor industry, TSMC—Taiwan’s largest company and the world’s largest chip producer—pledged a $100 billion investment in the U.S., which appeared to mollify Trump as semiconductors are exempt from this latest round of tariffs. Thailand Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said Thailand is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. after Trump announced a 36% “reciprocal” tariff on its goods. The U.S. is Thailand’s largest export market. Shinawatra said that Thailand’s actual tariff rate on U.S. imports is on average 9% rather than the 72% figure the White House presented.\n\n“Thailand has signaled its readiness to discuss with the U.S. government at the first opportunity to adjust the trade balance to be fair to both the parties,” Shinawatra told reporters on Thursday. She said Thailand could become a “friend-shoring” country for the U.S. by importing agriculture products to process and re-export. “Don’t panic as other countries are also facing higher tariffs,” Thai Chamber of Commerce chairman Poj Aramwattananont also told reporters on Thursday, though he admitted he did not expect more than a 25% tariff from the U.S. “The U.S. will also have some impact from this,” he added, “as they still can’t produce to replace the imports fast enough.” U.K. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday morning that the U.K. would respond to Trump’s tariffs with “cool and calm heads.” Starmer added that the U.K., which faces the baseline 10% levy, is in a “better position than a lot of other countries from what was announced last night.”\n\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News on Thursday that the U.K. “will take any action we need to give ourselves the tools that we need to respond to announcements of this kind.” Reynolds added that he wants negotiations with the U.S. to lead to a total removal of the tariffs on the U.K. “I want them removed in terms of the 10% that’s been announced. I want them removed on steel and aluminium. I don’t think there is an argument, a strong argument, for those being in place,” he said. “I want not only to remove what has been announced so far, but to strengthen that relationship. I want more U.K. businesses with stronger market access to all parts of the U.S. That’s the prize on offer.” Ukraine Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko posted on X on Thursday that Trump’s new 10% tariffs on Ukraine are “complicated, but not critical.” She added that in 2024 Ukraine bought $3.4 billion worth of goods from the U.S. and exported just $874 million worth of goods to the U.S. She also said Ukrainian tariffs on U.S. goods are “quite low—the rate on cars is 10%, on coal and oil—0%” and that Ukraine’s government will work to “ensure better conditions for Ukraine.”\n\n“Ukraine has something to offer the United States as a reliable ally and partner,” Svyrydenko said. “Both our countries benefit from fair tariffs.”\n\nVietnam\n\nAccording to a government website, ​​Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyễn Hồng Diên sent a diplomatic note Wednesday requesting the U.S. to “postpone the decision to impose tariffs to spend time discussing and finding a reasonable solution for both sides.” Tạ Hoàng Linh, who heads the ministry’s foreign market development department, said in the statement that “there is still room for discussion and negotiation between the two sides to reach a mutually beneficial result.”",

    "content": "The press conference starts like any other: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is grilled on everything from affordable housing and war in the Middle East to his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump. Then, Lana, 11, picks up the microphone. “Do you think social media has an impact on kids?” asks the suburban Canberra primary-school student. Of all the burning issues of the day, it’s the one that Albanese feels on surest ground to answer. It also goes to the heart of his government’s most eye-catching policy—one that directly affects Lana and the other student reporters invited to interrogate Australia’s top politician for Behind the News, a long-running kids’ current-affairs show.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“It certainly does, and that’s why we’re going to ban social media for under-16s,” Albanese replies resolutely. “I want to see you all out playing with each other at lunchtime, talking to each other like we are now, and engaging with each other … rather than just being on your devices.” The fact that Australia’s Prime Minister carved out 45 minutes between parliamentary sessions to indulge kids at least two terms from voting age underlines his belief that social media represents an unambiguous threat to his nation’s most precious resource: its children. And he is determined to do something about it.\n\nAlbanese answers questions from students from St. Francis of Assisi Primary School in Canberra on Feb. 5. Chris Gurney for TIME\n\nThe perils are largely beyond dispute. Some of the world’s biggest companies use the fig leaf of “engagement” to hook children during vulnerable developmental stages, rewiring their brains via a firehose of addictive content that psychologists say has changed human development on a previously unfathomable scale. In the decade that followed the proliferation of mobile internet services in 2010, depression among young Americans rose around 150%, with corresponding spikes in anxiety and self-harm. The trend is mirrored across the developed world, including Australia, where mental health hospitalizations soared 81% for teen girls and 51% for boys over the same period. “It has become the No. 1 issue that parents are talking about,” says Albanese. “These are developing minds, and young people need the space to be able to grow up.” On Dec. 10, in a bid to carve out and ring-fence that space, Australia will implement a 16-year-old age limit for users of platforms such as Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X. The law is the first of its kind in the world.\n\nWhile most platforms have a self-imposed age limit of 13, enforcement is laughable; kids can simply input a false date of birth. Rather than targeting underage kids, the Australian law will punish companies that fail to introduce adequate safeguards with fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($31 million) for as yet undefined “systemic breaches.” (The precise details of how and when these fines will be imposed have yet to be made clear.) In other words, Australia will flip the equation: instead of relying on users to truthfully disclose their ages, it will put the burden on the world’s tech giants.\n\nIt’s a bold move, directly targeting some of the world’s most influential companies run by its richest and most powerful men, including X owner Elon Musk—who has dubbed the Albanese government “fascists” and the age restriction “a backdoor way to control access to the internet by all Australians.”\n\nFor its proponents, however, the law is a critical first step toward checking social media’s toxic influence on children.\n\nIllustration by Brobel Design for TIME\n\nIn November, France’s Education Minister said the E.U. should “urgently” follow Australia’s example—not least since the infusion of artificial intelligence means that supercharged algorithms are peddling disinformation faster than ever. “The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit,” former U.S. President Joe Biden lamented in his farewell address. The upshot: Australia has now come to serve as a beachhead for others to prepare their own defenses. The U.K., Ireland, Singapore, Japan, and the E.U. are among many jurisdictions closely monitoring Canberra’s next move. In the U.S., the bipartisan Kids Off Social Media Act (KOSMA) to restrict social media for kids under 13 and bar platforms from pushing targeted content to users under 17 is advancing through the Senate, while around half of states passed legislation last year to make it harder for children and teens to spend time online without supervision. On March 5, Utah became the first state to require app stores to verify users’ ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps.\n\n“If the age restriction goes well in Australia, then I think it will go global very quickly,” says Professor Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University’s Stern School of Business and author of The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness. Albanese’s stance is also remarkable for just how politically uncontroversial it has proved. As Australia heads for a close federal election in May, Albanese’s center-left Labour Party and the right-leaning Liberal-National Coalition opposition are locking horns on every issue, whether nuclear energy, health care funding, or taxation. But the social media age restriction passed with bipartisan support and stands to be implemented no matter who triumphs at the ballot box. That’s not to say there aren’t detractors—and not just the social media companies, which say the legislation passed without due consultation. “We are concerned the government’s rapid, closed-door consultation process on the minimum-age law is undermining necessary discourse,” a Meta spokesperson told TIME. TikTok complained that an exemption for YouTube was “akin to banning the sale of soft drinks to minors but exempting Coca-Cola.”\n\nSome mental health experts, meanwhile, say blocking kids from social media will drive them to darker, less regulated corners of the internet. Others fear children who bypass the age restriction will find themselves in a less controlled space where they’re unable to seek help. There’s also huge debate over what exactly counts as social media when myriad gaming and educational websites also employ addictive scrolling features. A group of 140 mental health experts penned an open letter to the Albanese government to oppose the ban, calling it “too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.” For Albanese, an imperfect plan is better than no plan at all. “We acknowledge that this won’t be absolute,” Albanese tells TIME during an exclusive interview in his parliamentary office in February. “But it does send a message about what society thinks and will empower parents to have those conversations with their children.”\n\nThey are children whose upbringing is unrecognizable from that of any previous generation. If parents once fretted about the attention kids paid to comic books and television, the immersive, dopamine-driven pull of the computer screen—video games, chat platforms, social media—has changed how nearly everyone looks at the world, but especially young people. A February government report by Australia’s eSafety Commissioner found that 80% of preteens used social media. A 2024 Pew Research poll found 46% of American teens said they were online “almost constantly.” Nearly a quarter of U.K. 5-to-7-year-olds now have their own smartphone. The devices can bring physical danger. Pedophiles and traffickers stalk the virtual world with greater freedom than in the real one. In 2023, the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) tracked 298 attempted abductions involving 381 children and received 36.2 million reports of suspected child sexual exploitation online.\n\n80% of Australian preteens used social media, according to a February report from Australia’s eSafety Commissioner. William West—AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut concern also wells around a child alone with a phone. For Albanese, there’s something especially sad about Australian kids shunning some of the world’s highest rates of sunshine for the artificial glare of screens. His own childhood in a one-parent household in Sydney’s industrial inner-city suburb of Camperdown was far from idyllic. His mother was crippled by chronic rheumatoid arthritis, meaning the family survived on her disability payments and his grandmother’s pension. Home was a government-housing block flanked by a children’s hospital, biscuit factory, and metal foundry. But there was a grassy patch where kids would hang around playing rugby, cricket, or swapping football cards. “We would go out to play at 9 o’clock and just knew you had to be home for lunch, and then do the same in the afternoon,” Albanese recalls. “People interacted with each other. And that capacity to communicate face-to-face is really important. They learn how to win, how to lose, how to engage.”\n\nIt may sound wistful, but Albanese’s perspective is backed by science. Psychologists say physical play, preferably outdoors and among a mix of ages, is essential to a child’s development. Young people learn how to not get hurt by negotiating scenarios in which getting hurt is possible, such as climbing a tree or leaping from a swing at its zenith. But such play is increasingly a thing of the past. Instead, time on screens has grown and grown, turbo-charged in 2009 with the arrival of the “like” button on Facebook and “retweet” on Twitter, now X—innovations that, in the minds of many experts, transformed social media from a harmless friendship forum to an algorithm-driven popularity contest. Instagram debuted a year later, coinciding with the launch of the iPhone 4 and Samsung Galaxy S, both of which featured the world’s first front-facing cameras. Instagram’s array of filters allowed users to make images less natural and more stylized and are now ubiquitous across Snapchat, TikTok, and other platforms.\n\nThe result has been a great deal of diversion, not all of it positive. The digital realm brings striking new elements of risk, for instance, to young people’s emerging sexuality, from the distorting effect of readily available hardcore pornography on all who see it (the term incel, or involuntarily celibate, was coined for frustrated, often misogynistic young men who bond online), as well as a heightened risk of online grooming and sextortion. In July 2022, 17-year-old Rohan Patrick Cosgriff died by suicide near his home outside Melbourne after he was pressured into sending an intimate picture to someone called “Christine” on Snapchat, who then demanded money not to distribute the images. A note in Cosgriff’s pocket simply said: “I made a huge mistake. I’m sorry.” The Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation received over 58,000 reports of online child abuse in 2023–24, a 45% year-on-year rise. Australia is far from unique; the NCMEC, in the U.S., saw a rise of over 300% in reports of online enticement including sextortion from 2021 to 2023.\n\nFor girls, social media takes a different role—one that statistics show can prove even more damaging. Whereas male social hierarchy has traditionally adhered to physical attributes like sporting prowess, girls find value in the breadth and depth of relationships. In short, popularity. And one way to climb the social ziggurat is to undermine your peers: spread gossip, turn friends against rivals, and lower others’ value within the group. Read More: ‘We’re In a New World’: American Teenagers on Mental Health and How to Cope But the explosion of front-facing cameras and filters has meant the reflection teens see in the mirror has become less and less attractive compared with the carefully curated photos and videos of their peers online, causing self-worth to plunge. “Girls seeing lots of beautiful pictures of other girls living perfect lives is absolutely devastating to them,” says Haidt. Those with poor self-worth are likelier to lash out at others, with “indirect” bullying more prevalent among adolescent girls than boys.\n\nOne of the first things that Kelly O’Brien saw upon entering 12-year-old Charlotte’s bedroom on Sept. 9 was her cell phone on the floor. Then she noticed two pillows neatly arranged under the duvet. By the time she found her daughter in the en suite bathroom it was too late. When the paramedics arrived, “they just looked at her and said, ‘So sorry, she’s gone,’” says O’Brien, eyes brimming. Kelly believes Charlotte took her own life at their suburban Sydney home in large part because of the toxic effect of social media. Charlotte was a bright girl who loved cheerleading, doted on her baby brother, and was navigating the tricky road from childhood to adulthood, equally obsessed with Taylor Swift and Gossip Girl as well as the latest Disney animation. Charlotte had suffered bullying at school, but her parents say it was social media that rendered that cycle of acceptance and rejection unbearably acute. “The weeks that she was in, she was over the moon,” says Mat O’Brien, Charlotte’s dad. “The week she was out, just awful.”\n\nAs soon as Charlotte got a cell phone it became a problem, spurring reclusive, depressive episodes. Charlotte had her phone confiscated more often than she had access, Kelly says, a punishment that invariably began with two days of sullen withdrawal followed by a marked upturn in mood—classic addiction symptoms, say psychologists. The night before her passing, Charlotte had been upbeat, enjoying her favorite pasta dinner and baking banana bread for the next day. “I kissed the happiest girl in the world good night,” says Kelly. Something happened after she got to her room. A friend who spoke to a distraught Charlotte later that evening has since told Kelly about the vile, hateful message her daughter received via Snapchat. (“We are deeply committed to keeping our community safe,” a Snap spokesperson told TIME. “Our hearts go out to this family, whose pain is unimaginable.”) Social media companies say that bullying has always been a problem and will continue whether via schoolyard taunts, crank phone calls, or their platforms. Still, beginning in the early 2010s, girls’ mental health was hit by a sharp rise in rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm. The rate of self-harm for young adolescent girls in the U.S. nearly tripled from 2010 to 2020, while the rate for older teens doubled. In 2020, 1 out of every 4 American teen girls had experienced a major depressive episode in the previous year.\n\nFamily photos of Charlotte O’Brien, who died by suicide at age 12 in September after being bullied on social media. Courtesy of the O’Brien family\n\nKelly O’Brien explained the devastating effects of social media on Charlotte in a letter to Albanese as part of the 36 Months campaign—a grassroots movement to raise and properly enforce the age limit for social media to 16. “When you hear firsthand about a parent losing their child then it undoubtedly has an impact,” says Albanese, who later invited the O’Briens to meet with him in Canberra. Also at that meeting was Michael Wipfli, an Australian radio presenter known as “Wippa,” who spearheaded 36 Months. “Sat in the Prime Minister’s office, it was clear he knew what needed to be done,” says Wippa. “We needed leadership, a captain’s call, somebody to say, ‘enough is enough.’”\n\nAlbanese first became involved in leftist politics while studying economics at the University of Sydney. He rose up the Labour Party ranks with a reputation as a backroom mediator and a knack for forging concord between squabbling factions. After Labour’s shock defeat in Australia’s 2019 federal election, Albanese emerged as an unexpected but unifying leadership candidate. “He’s an accidental Prime Minister,” says Nick Bisley, dean of social sciences at La Trobe University. Indeed, Albanese has struggled to unify an ever more polarized country—despite an undeniable everyman charisma. As Albanese inspected repairs to a bridge destroyed by floodwater in northern Queensland, he was joined by the mayor of the cut-off town of Ingham, population 4,455, who arrived wearing shorts, a faded polo shirt, thong sandals, and a cap advertising the local tractor mechanic. “You didn’t have to dress up!” teased a local lawmaker as helicopters carrying supplies buzzed overhead. “Anthony’s an ordinary bloke!”\n\nIt’s a pit stop that showcases Australia’s endearing insouciance as well as how vital internet access has become for communications across its vast expanse—not least as climate change renders extreme weather more frequent and severe. Australia is the world’s sixth largest country by landmass—roughly equivalent to the U.S. minus Alaska—though 55th by population with just 26 million people. The result is an abundance of sparsely inhabited outback communities for which social media is “absolutely critical,” admits Albanese. “We’re not Luddites,” he adds, reeling off the various platforms he posts on. “Young people aren’t being banned from a range of interactions through technology that are about their education or engaging with each other. We’re not confiscating people’s devices.”\n\nAlbanese welcomes students from St. Francis of Assisi Primary School in Calwell to his office in Canberra on Feb. 5. Chris Gurney for TIME\n\nAlbanese points to the success of last year’s ban of cell phones in Australian public schools. “The impact has been phenomenal,” says Australian Education Minister Jason Clare. A survey of almost 1,000 school principals in Australia’s most populous state of New South Wales shows 87% say students are less distracted in the classroom while 81% have noticed improved learning. Meanwhile, South Australia has seen a 63% decline in critical incidents—such as bullying and distribution of explicit or derogatory content—involving social media and 54% fewer behavioral issues. “But when school ends the phones come out and they’re back in the cesspit of social media,” says Clare. “In the old days, bullying and intimidation stopped at the school gate. Now it’s at home as well.” Read More: For Teens, Saving Each Other From Social Media Is a Team Effort Still, critics say the social media age restriction was a knee-jerk reaction passed without proper consultation, involves thorny data-privacy issues, and creates even more risks for youngsters who use platforms illicitly. “It’s absolutely dumb, it’s not going to work,” says Roy Sugarman, a Sydney-based clinical psychologist. “It’s ridiculous because the genie is out of the bottle.”\n\nSugarman compares the Australian ban to American Prohibition in the 1920s, which some studies suggest actually increased alcohol consumption in the U.S. while leading to a spike in organized crime. He says a far better tactic would be to teach teens to be technologically astute, to understand online dangers, how to think rationally, act with purpose, and deal with the virtual world to mitigate damages. “Human behavior doesn’t lend itself to being told what to do,” says Sugarman. “It’s the opposite. Humans hate being told what to do.” History also offers examples that point the other way. While Sugarman invokes the example of Prohibition, Wippa compares social media age restrictions to similar rules for cigarettes, which while routinely flouted have led smoking rates among young people to plummet. But the fact is, nobody knows what will happen. Nothing like this has been attempted before. And then there’s the question of implementation. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, says that around 30 different age-verification technologies are being tested in collaboration with various social media platforms, including French firm BorderAge, which claims to accurately gauge age using AI analysis of hand signals. Meanwhile, platforms, which the legislation makes responsible for enforcing the age restrictions, want to pass that burden to app stores, principally run by Apple and Google, saying they should act as gatekeepers.\n\nGrant compares the legislation to laws regarding fencing swimming pools. In the early 1970s, the widespread availability of cheap, preformed fiberglass pools meant the rate of young children drowning soared. Not long after, states began requiring all private swimming pools to be fenced, which led deaths to fall and has since been adopted nationwide. But that didn’t mean Australia suddenly stopped teaching kids to swim, fired all the lifeguards, or fenced off the ocean. “This is not the great Australian firewall,” says Grant. “Children’s social media accounts aren’t going to magically disappear. But we can make things a lot better for parents and a lot better for kids.” Grant speaks with the zeal of a convert. After cutting her teeth as a congressional staffer focused on tech issues in the 1990s, the Seattle native worked 17 years at Microsoft, two years at Twitter, and a year at Adobe, before being tapped for her current post (the first e-Safety Commissioner anywhere in the world). She believes, from her inside knowledge of the tech industry, that the big players will always put profit first. “They can target you with advertising with deadly precision,” she says. “They could use the same technologies to be able to identify hateful content and child sexual abuse material.”\n\nRecent events have cemented her skepticism. Last April, Grant sued X over its refusal to remove videos of a religiously motivated stabbing of a bishop in a Sydney church that sparked rioting. X eventually geofenced it so it wasn’t available in Australia, while Musk hit out at Grant as “censorship commissar,” leading to a raft of online abuse. “I still receive death threats,” she tells TIME. But even more painful for Grant is the knowledge that 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana watched that same Sydney church attack video on X just six minutes before leaving home with a knife to murder three young children and injure 10 others in the U.K. town of Southport on July 29. “Having gratuitous violence of terrorist events freely available normalizes it, desensitizes it,” says Grant, “and in the worst cases [it] radicalizes and spills over into real-world harm.”\n\nThe spat between Grant and Musk prompted Albanese to label the tech mogul an “arrogant billionaire.” But asked by TIME whether he’s concerned by Musk’s burgeoning influence as Trump’s consigliere, Albanese demurs, instead decrying how misinformation can erode trust in institutions. “People have conflict fatigue,” he says. “People need to have respectful debate. And I think there is a concern in society that some of that is breaking down.”\n\nAlbanese’s squirming is understandable. Australia and the U.S. are close allies linked via the Quad and AUKUS military arrangements. But Trump spent his first term taking aim at historic alliances, accusing South Korea and Japan of not paying their fair share for American security guarantees, and his return to the White House has heralded a full-frontal assault on European democracies. Australia is one of the few close American allies with a trade deficit with the U.S.—“since Truman!” Albanese stresses—as well as a record of deploying alongside American forces and standing up to Beijing. In 2023, Canberra also agreed to invest $3 billion into U.S. shipyards. However, the White House has already hiked tariffs on Australian exports of aluminum and steel, while Albanese’s plan to force tech companies like Google and Meta to pay for news shared on their platforms was recently labeled an “outrageous” attempt to “steal our tax revenues” by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.\n\nThe social media age restriction is yet another friction point between Canberra and American Big Business. Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has called on the Trump Administration to help “push back on this global trend” of what he terms “censorship.” Then there’s Kevin Rudd, former Australian Prime Minister and current ambassador to the U.S., who was previously quoted calling Trump not only “the most destructive President in history” but also a “village idiot.” “The center-left of Australian politics is a long way from the MAGA world,” adds Bisley, of La Trobe University. “Australia’s welfare-state instincts are just not particularly aligned to the free-market capitalism of the U.S.” It’s friction that raises the question of whether Australia can even enforce social media age restrictions. While potential $31 million fines may seem eye-watering, that’s the top penalty for “systemic breaches”—rather than per offense, day, or child—and mere pocket change to someone like Meta’s Zuckerberg or X’s Musk, the world’s richest man, worth hundreds of billions and with an ideological antipathy to what he perceives as curbs on free speech. (X failed to respond to repeated requests for comment for this story.) Asked whether social media platforms could be banned outright for noncompliance with the new legislation, Australia’s Communications Minister Michelle Rowland replies, “That’s not a feature of the legislation.”\n\nIn the final analysis, it might not matter. For Mat and Kelly O’Brien, the social media age restriction at least takes the issue out of parents’ hands, just like for driving or drinking alcohol. Asked whether Charlotte would still be alive if the legislation had been in place last September, Kelly has no doubt. “Absolutely,” she says, “1,000%.” And while it might be too late to save Charlotte, they’re hopeful Albanese’s stand means other families might be spared similar heartache. “I feel like lesser men would have crumbled,” Kelly says. “But he stood up to Big Tech and the naysayers. I’m very grateful and proud.”\n\nIf you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental-health crisis or contemplating suicide, call or text 988.

    "content": "If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\n\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\n\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\n\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\n\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\n\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\n\n****\n\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\n\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\n\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\n\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\n\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\n\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\n\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\n\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital",

    "title": "Trump Says U.S. Will Have Direct Talks With Iran",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "President Donald Trump said Monday the U.S. will hold direct talks with Iran about its nuclear program, while warning Tehran it would be in “great danger” if the talks aren't successful. The president, in comments to reporters after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the talks will start Saturday. He insisted Tehran can’t get nuclear weapons. “We’re dealing with them directly and maybe a deal is going to be made,\" Trump said. He added that “doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAsked if he would commit to military action against Iran should his negotiators be unable to come to terms with Tehran, Trump responded that \"Iran is going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it.” “If the talks aren’t successful, I think it’s going to be a very bad day for Iran,\" Trump said. Trump during his first White House term withdrew the U.S. from the landmark nuclear accord with Iran negotiated by Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration. Netanyahu says he supports Trump’s diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement with Iran, adding that Israel and the U.S. share the same goal of ensuring that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon. The Israeli leader, known for his hawkish views on Iran and past calls for military pressure, said he would welcome a diplomatic agreement along the lines of Libya’s deal with the international community in 2003. “I think that would be a good thing,” he said. “But whatever happens, we have to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons.”\n\nTrump said the talks would happen “at almost the highest level,\" but declined to say where the negotiations would take place or who he was dispatching for the sensitive diplomacy. He announced plans for the surprise engagement as Netanyahu made a hastily arranged visit to the White House — his second in just over two months — to discuss the tariffs Trump has unleashed on countries around the world, Iran's nuclear program and the Israel-Hamas war. In withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Trump declared he was making the world safer, but he also deepened his isolation on the world stage and revived doubts about American credibility. The agreement, which also included Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, had lifted most U.S. and international economic sanctions against Iran. “I think it’ll be, different and maybe a lot stronger,” Trump said on how a new deal might be different from the one negotiated by Obama officials.\n\nTrump and Netanyahu said they also discussed tensions with Iran, Israel-Turkey ties and the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant against the Israeli leader last year. Trump in February signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC over its investigations of Israel. Before his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump held a call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II. All three leaders have been key interlocutors in efforts to tamp down tensions in the Middle East and bring an end to the Israel-Hamas war. The prime minister soon after arriving in Washington on Sunday evening met with senior Trump administration officials, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jameson Greer, to discuss the tariffs. And Netanyahu met on Monday with Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, ahead of his sit down with the president.\n\nOn tariffs, Netanyahu said he assured Trump that his government would move to erase United States trade deficit. “We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States,” Netanyahu said “We intend to do it very quickly.” Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations, said he expected Trump to use the tariffs as leverage to force concessions from Netanyahu. In Israel’s case, those concessions might not be economic. Trump may pressure Netanyahu to move toward ending the war in Gaza — at the very least through some interim truce with Hamas that would pause the fighting and free more hostages. Gilboa said Trump is hoping to return from his first overseas trip — expected next month to Saudi Arabia — with some movement on a deal to normalize relations with Israel, which would likely require significant Israeli concessions on Gaza. If he does manage to move toward bolstering ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, that would act as a regional diplomatic counterweight to pressure Iran, against which Trump has threatened new sanctions and suggested military action over its nuclear program.\n\nIn a preemptive move last week, Israel announced that it was removing all tariffs on goods from the U.S., mostly on imported food and agricultural products, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. But the tactic failed, and with a 17% rate, Israel was just one of dozens of countries that were slapped with tariffs on Trump’s so-called Liberation Day last week. Although Israel is a tiny market for U.S. products, the United States is a key trade partner of Israel. Much of that trade is for high-tech services, which are not directly affected by the tariffs, but key Israeli industries could be impacted. The Manufacturers Association of Israel estimates that the tariffs will cost Israel about $3 billion in exports each year and lead to the loss of 26,000 jobs in industries that include biotechnology, chemicals, plastics and electronics. The World Bank says Israel’s gross domestic product, a measure of economic output, is over $500 billion a year.\n\n“The damage won’t stop at exports,” said Ron Tomer, the group’s president. “It will scare investors, encourage companies to leave Israel and undermine our image as a global center of innovation.” He called on the government to work urgently to protect the economy.",

    "title": "Mike Johnson Could Shut Down Trump’s Tariffs",
    "source": "https://time.com/",
    "content": "This article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox. There is one person aside from Donald Trump who could definitely put an end to this economic chaos. His name is Mike Johnson. And the House Speaker would really, really like it if you could keep his name out your mouth. As the President continues to goad a global meltdown unseen in decades, Speaker Johnson is trying to keep the MAGA meltdown away from his fellow House Republicans. Trump has triggered an utter circus that may haunt GOP lawmakers for a generation and retirees into their graves. Even Trump allies like Sens. Rand Paul and Chuck Grassley—for different reasons, sure—are sounding an alarm about the repercussions of these add-ons.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRep. Don Bacon, an Omaha Republican, has legislation teed up in the House to make a move against Trump’s unilateral emergency tariffs. His bill lacks sufficient public support from GOP colleagues for now, but the private frustrations among lawmakers are starting to pile up. For now, most are not willing to defy the President. A similar bill in the Senate has bipartisan backing, and would almost certainly draw more Republicans if they could be sure they weren’t walking the plank only to see Johnson toss it in a desk drawer to die. If Johnson were to give the green light to a measure reasserting Congress’ authority over tariffs, things would change really quickly on Capitol Hill. There would likely be majorities in both chambers for such legislation—perhaps even large enough to override the veto Trump promised on Monday to issue if such a bill reached his desk. But such a bold move could very well lead to Johnson getting a pink slip from his caucus, as his Speakership barely happened, and only then with Trump’s intervention.\n\nFor his part, Trump seems utterly undeterred by this political quagmire. “We’re going to get fair deals and good deals with everybody. And if we don’t, we’re going to have nothing to do with them. They’re not going to be allowed to participate in the United States,” he said Monday. It is, to be clear, an entirely avoidable cul-de-sac of chaos that Trump is steering the economy toward. And, if House members were willing to vote their conscience, this would end in short order. Also to be clear: they are not. Access to international markets is the lifeblood for a lot of red districts’ economies—think tractors, soy beans, medical devices—and making those products less appealing as exports is a first punch in a one-two combo that now includes higher costs in the aisles for imports that used to be cheaper goods from China, Singapore, and India. The hit hasn’t come at the check-out line just yet, but investors are seeing the trouble just around the corner and reacting with contempt. At the White House on Monday, Trump dismissed those playing the markets as stupid cowards who did not share his optimism that a golden age of American power is just off the horizon, if only they have the patience. “Tariffs will make this country very rich,” Trump said in a free-wheeling session in the Oval Office as the Israeli Prime Minister seemed to play the role of a potted plant.\n\nAs the White House continued to insist everything is fine and even floated a spin-up of tariffs on China to reach 130% penalties, Wall Street continued to slide into an open rebellion against a White House that not that long ago seemed like a natural ally. Even a European Union proposal to zero-out tariffs on some U.S. goods proved insufficient for Trump, who said “the E.U. has been very tough over the years.” The fast-moving snowball stands to drive up prices on almost every single item in U.S. families’ cupboards. Some Trump officials continue to suggest this is merely the opening of a negotiation, while the President and others say the new tariff regime is irrevocable and righteous retaliation. All the while, the House seems to be sitting in a passive crouch, watching the tariff crisis gaining speed and acting as if it has no offramp at its disposal. The politics of this are entirely predictable and precarious. The House map has already proven frail. The Senate map is only slightly fungible. GOP holds in state races are fragile. If you’re not catching the trend, there are a lot of F-based words on the offing when it comes to Republican dominance. And it isn’t getting easier as markets flail.\n\nMonday’s developments were greeted with grimace around town. Goldman Sachs escalated the odds of a recession to 45% in a note to investors. K Street players have been warning lawmakers of problems in their districts on goods ranging from seed oil to auto components, airplanes to wheat thrashers. If all politics is local, then all tariffs are pitfalls. For now, Johnson is maintaining his support of whatever Trump wants. But if the Speaker were to blink, there are very good odds that his team would shelve their red MAGA hats briefly enough to rollback Trump’s tariffs. Yet any swerve away from Trump’s blessed route risks ending with House Republicans pursuing a vote-of-no-confidence against Johnson, who has so far been impressively steady at the helm of a caucus that is unwieldy at best. That’s why, among some Republicans on the Hill—especially in the upper ranks of senior aides—there is a professed indifference to these rumblings.\n\n“Everything is garbage. That much was true last week. It is true this week. It will be true next week. Everyone needs to calm down,” a top hand in House Republicans’ Leadership texted me early Monday. “You can panic all you want. But President Trump is still the leader of the party. Speaker Johnson has the gavel. Leader [John] Thune runs the Senate. And the Supreme Court is our friend. As the kids say: STFU.” The bifurcated Rome-is-Burning/ Steady-as-she-Goes posture is what is driving the conservative movement in Congress at the moment. No one loves that Trump has a monopoly on the party, but it’s been a marriage of necessity since 2015. But that arrangement is being tested, as the phone lines on Capitol Hill burn up with constituents worried about their retirement accounts and the future of local businesses. Which brings us back to Johnson, an accidental Speaker whose majority is on the cusp and his loyalty is at best marginal. His rank-and-file members on Monday were feeling the burn of a Trump stunt that has cost the economy trillions in less than a week. The fall-off on markets since Trump’s Inauguration Day has been as steep as any in recent memory. And no one is credibly dismissing it as a blip any longer.\n\nPut simply: the tariff crisis is Trump’s doing, but it’s Johnson and his Republican hostage-takers who keep it alive.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

    "source": "https://www.bbc.com/",
    "content": "Before Brook's debut he was described as \"dumb\" by Stokes, something for which the all-rounder later apologised.\n\nHis answers may be brief but do not mistake that for a lack of cricket brain.\n\nBrook's 317 against Pakistan last year may take the headlines but one of his best innings was in the drawn 2023 Ashes series at Headingley, when he hit 75 in a chase which had to be managed with the urn on the line.\n\nBrook, like Stokes, is a remarkably hard worker.\n\nHe was the chubby kid at Sedbergh, told he would not make a county cricketer because he was not fit enough in the field.\n\nBrook corrected that by running in the Cumbrian fells and last year he used a break, because of the death of his grandmother, to shed pounds and became the leading fielder in the England team.\n\nThat is one area in which England's white-ball teams are trailing the best teams in the world.\n\nThe sample size is small - five matches against Australia and one season with Northern Superchargers in The Hundred - when it comes to assessing what sort of England captain Brook will be.\n\nStill, do not expect significant change.\n\n\"It is very similar to how we want to play in Test cricket. Always looking to put the bowler under pressure and make them change,\" he said during that Australia series, when asked how he wanted the 50-over side to play.\n\nBrook admitted himself he was \"frantic\" at the start of that series but overall, despite England losing 3-2 to the world champions, he largely impressed.\n\nHe showed imagination in a win at Chester-le-Street where Cameron Green was caught by a fielder in an unusual position behind the non-striking batter, and bowler Jacob Bethell immediately turned to celebrate in Brook's direction.\n\nKey will also hope captaincy brings the best of Brook the white-ball player.\n\nBrook scored 110 in that win at Durham, which remains his only international white-ball century despite all of his obvious talent.\n\nHe was not the only England batter to struggle, but a difficult time in the Champions Trophy and the tour of India that preceded it leaves him with 188 runs across 11 white-ball innings at an average of 17.09 this year.\n\nThe biggest negative of appointing Brook is the workload it adds to one of England's busiest players as a Test, 50-over and T20 mainstay.\n\nEngland's schedule is packed, with 11 Tests, nine one-day internationals and 12 T20s before the end of the Ashes in January.\n\nThere is then a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka to follow in late February and March, where Brook will lead on the global stage for the first time.\n\nFor now at least, England's plan is that he will play everything.\n\nThere are no direct clashes in fixtures while he is young, does not have children and has had a decent break - having skipped this year's Indian Premier League.\n\nIt is not without risk. A burnt-out Brook would hurt England almost as much as an injury to Stokes in Australia.\n\nFor Key, though, this one is a gamble worth taking.",

    "content": "This Hawaiian island's 'freakosystems' are a warning from the future\n\n4 days ago Share Save Matthew Ponsford Share Save\n\nSean MacDonald A completely new ecosystem has emerged on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu composed of a mishmash of species from elsewhere (Credit: Sean MacDonald)\n\nEcosystems which have never been seen before are being accidentally created by humans. They offer a stark look into the nature of tomorrow.\n\nVenture deep into the forests on O'ahu, Hawaii's third largest island, and you'll find yourself threading through a dense understory of richly scented pepper, cinnamon and guava trees.\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" says Corey Tarwater, an ecologist at the University of Wyoming in the US who began researching O'ahu's ecosystems in 2014. Sounds like the \"cheww-chewww\" song of the pale green warbling white-eye and the chattering, almost electrical call of the red-billed leiothrix surround you. \"There's really neat lizards around,\" adds Tarwater. \"There's these highly structured forests with these amazing tropical plant species.\"\n\nFor hikers setting out on O'ahu's mountain trails, these are thrilling wildernesses within easy reach of Hawaii's capital, Honolulu, says Tarwater. Yet nothing is quite as it might seem, she adds. \"You wouldn't know unless you study them, but if you walk around any forest around Honolulu, there's not going to be one single native plant species there.\"\n\nO'ahu's lowland forests are now almost entirely devoid of the plants and animals that grew here for millions of years before the arrival of humans. Settlers brought extinctions by cutting down trees to make farms and introducing voracious predators and disease-carrying animals. Today, these tropical forests are a tapestry of non-native species introduced from every corner of the planet: Brazilian peppertree, Indonesian cinnamon and roseleaf bramble from the Himalayas and Australia. Most of the animals, including all the birds that Tarwater mentioned earlier, are also alien.\n\nIf you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward – Jens-Christian Svenning\n\nO'ahu's mountainous terrain – a filming location that has evoked heroic, untrammelled wildernesses in the Jurassic Park and King Kong films – is shaped \"at every level\" by human action, says Jef Vizentin-Bugoni, a Brazilian ecologist at Universidade Federal de Pelota who researched the island's birds with Tarwater. He recalls having his expectations upturned when he arrived on the island in 2017, eager to see Hawaii's famous honeycreepers, a set of brightly coloured native bird species that exist nowhere else in the world. Instead, he was first confronted with an unfamiliar flurry of red and white feathers, which turned out to be a red-whiskered bulbul, a bird whose native range spans from India to Southern China.\n\n\"I followed it as it flitted between trees until it stopped to feed on a fruit I immediately recognised – guava, a plant native to Brazil,\" he says. \"That moment captured the essence of what's happening in Hawaii: a South American plant being eaten by an Asian bird on a remote Pacific island.\"\n\nMost of these exotic species arrived in the last century or two and were thrown together more or less at random – some are escaped pets, others relics from abandoned farms. Yet unlike urban environments where foxes and seagulls scratch together a living eating anything they can find, the forests of O'ahu show signs of structure and organisation.\n\nJef Vizentin-Bugoni Fruits of the native Freycinetia arborea on O'ahu (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)\n\nBirds that have only lived together for the last century have assumed specialist roles, such as distributing the seeds of native plants, that were once performed by now extinct birds. In a 2019 study, Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni analysed the eating patterns of birds and seed dispersal on the island to see how they compared to a structured and stable native ecosystem that had evolved together over millennia.\n\n\"If I compare what I'm seeing in O'ahu with what I see in the middle of the Amazon, will the interactions have the same organisation?\" asked Vizentin-Bugoni. \"To our surprise, the answer was yes.\"\n\nHuman-made ecosystems\n\nFor the last few decades, ecologists have documented the appearance of \"emerging\" or \"novel ecosystems\" like that on O'ahu. Broadly, novel ecosystems can be defined as \"autonomous, wild ecosystems that deviate from natural baselines because of human activities\", explains ecologist Jens-Christian Svenning, a professor at Aarhus University in Denmark who studies these ecosystems. Novel ecosystems may contain combinations of species never before seen in history: with some native species living alongside other species introduced by humans beyond their historically recorded ranges or driven into new locations by climate change.\n\nHumans may also alter the environment itself, creating new habitats by reshaping the landscape or altering environmental chemistry. For example, along the coast of the Netherlands, marine ecologist Laura Govers has documented how a system of coastal defences like dams and sea walls, built during the mid-20th Century, has created a series of salty lakes where exotic species have flourished.\n\nFor the last decade scientists have studied O'ahu as an 'amazing crystal ball' that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet – Jef Vizentin-Bugoni\n\nOne former shale oil mine between the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow left a mountain made of stone, says Eric Higgs, professor of ecology at the University of Victoria in Canada. Over at least a century piles of stone formed a novel ecosystem through natural assembly processes, says Higgs. It is now a specially protected area that harbours rare plants such as the early purple orchid and the tiny white flowers of the knotted pearlwort.\n\nUnlike zoos and botanical gardens, which also contain globe-spanning collages of plants and animals, novel ecosystems like those on O'ahu are not dependent on humans to continually plant and maintain them. They now exist as self-sustaining systems, says Svenning. \"These are wild but changed ecosystems,\" he says. They have passed some critical threshold which means they are unlikely to ever go back to how they were before. \"If you removed all people from the planet, Hawaii would be on a different evolutionary ecological trajectory going forward,\" he says.\n\nSo how much of the planet is already covered by novel ecosystems like these? Some analyses have arrived at startling figures – in a 2013 book on novel ecosystems, researchers argued that 30-40% of the world's terrestrial ecosystems have already transformed into novel states. A study by Svenning projected that half of the land on the planet would be novel by 2100.\n\nJef Vizentin-Bugoni Researchers studying O'ahu's unusual ecosystem during fieldwork on a site in Kahanahaiki (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)\n\nHowever, these figures – like much around \"novel ecosystems\" – remain highly controversial among ecologists. Critics argue that scientists often cannot clearly define when a threshold of novelty has been passed. There are plenty of cases that are \"kind of borderline\", says Svenning. For example, power plants in Florida and Japan are venting warm water that has created tropical microenvironments with an abundance and variety of species not seen in the surrounding cooler waters.\n\n\"They don't depend on direct active management,\" like zoos, Svenning says. \"But they still rely on ongoing human activity to be there, right?\"\n\nHawaii's nature laboratory\n\nFor the last decade, says Vizentin-Bugoni, scientists have studied O'ahu as an \"amazing crystal ball\" that offers a glimpse of the future of our planet if humans continue to damage environments and drive species to extinction.\n\nFor millions of years, the remote location of the Hawaiian archipelago, some 2,000 miles (3,200km) from its nearest neighbour (the US mainland), made it a petri dish for the emergence of unique species. After the islands first emerged from the ocean as lifeless rocks erupting from volcanoes between 30 million and 500,000 years ago, plants and animals arrived there extremely rarely. Migrating birds were the exception, along with the seeds they deposited in their droppings.\n\nHawaii's plants and the birds that remained there therefore evolved largely in isolation from the rest of the world, leading to the evolution of species found nowhere else on the planet, from \"flightless ibises to bird-hunting owls\", writes anthropologist Todd Braje in his 2024 book Understanding Imperiled Earth. Without any mammals or large predators of any kind, unique birds evolved to fill diverse niches, like the moa-nalo, (or \"flightless megaducks\", as Braje calls them) that grew to 2ft (0.6m) in height and helped to disperse large seeds and cycle nutrients on the islands.\n\nWe like to think of O'ahu as the cautionary tale for all the other Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian Islands. It's what you don't want to have happen – Corey Tarwater\n\nOf the 142 species of bird that evolved to live on Hawaii and nowhere else on the planet, 95 are now extinct, including the moa-nalo, according to the American Bird Conservancy. Similar trends among plants and invertebrates have earned it the label of the \"extinction capital of the world\".\n\nHawaii's islands are a \"microcosm\" of the issues countries worldwide face from exotic species, according to 2020 research led by Liba Pejchar, a conservation scientist at the University of Colorado. The arrival of humans – first small groups of Polynesian sailors around 1,000 years ago, later Europeans in 1778 – resulted in forest clearances and the introduction of rats, dogs and cows. For birds, the greatest threat today is the mosquito, which since the 1800s has spread avian malaria that can kill native birds with a single bite.\n\n\"We like to think of O'ahu as the cautionary tale for all the other Pacific Islands and the Hawaiian Islands,\" says Tarwater. \"It's what you don't want to have happen.\"\n\nJef Vizentin-Bugoni A red-whiskered bulbul, whose native range spans from India to Southern China, feeds on the introduced Psidium guava in O'ahu (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)\n\nUnsurprisingly, when Tarwater began meticulously tagging Hawaiian birds, non-native species had a bad rap. \"When we first started working out on O'ahu, we were asked by people why we didn't just shoot the [non-native] birds,\" says Tarwater. But by instead observing them, her and Vizentin-Bugoni's team discovered that several of the last native fruiting plants, such as the violet berried uki'uki which clings on in pockets high up the mountains, are wholly dependent on non-native birds to disperse seeds.\n\n\"It was shocking to us that they were just so embedded into these systems,\" says Tarwater. Still, it's a \"double-edged sword\", she says. \"Unfortunately, they also disperse our non-native plants,\" she says – which can, in turn, crowd out the endangered natives.\n\nDuring a decade investigating the rich networks that have self-assembled here, both Tarwater and Vizentin-Bugoni have been amazed to find the extent to which ecosystems have meshed together. In a 2020 paper, Tarwater showed that the traits and bodies of non-native birds have shifted in areas they have invaded – some, for example, have smaller bills, better for eating O'ahu's smaller fruits. On O'ahu you can now watch mysterious flocks of numerous species take off together in search of fruit. This behaviour is also seen in the Amazon, but in O'ahu the flocks are made up of birds from all around the planet, from the Himalayas to South America.\n\n'Unrestorable' ecosystems\n\nFor the profoundly and irreversibly changed environments we see in O'ahu, the most intuitive name might have come not from a scientist at all but from Higgs' young daughter: she has dubbed them \"freakosystems\", he says. Since these strange places began to gain recognition in the late 1990s, the biggest question has been what environmentalists should do about them.\n\nInvasive species Deliberately and accidentally, humans have introduced countless species of animals, plants and other organisms to non-native biomes. While most new additions are innocuous, more than 37,000 species have been found to harm native species, habitats and ecosystems, causing them to be labelled invasive, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Globally, invasive non-native species are one of the top five drivers of global biodiversity loss, according to IPBES, contributing to 60% of global extinctions and causing damages worth $423bn (£323bn) per year.\n\nRestoration ecologists have been on the frontlines of answering this question, says Higgs. Traditionally, these scientists have aimed to recover degraded landscapes towards some reference point – often, in the Americas, this was set about the time that European colonies began arising in the Americas. The idea was to restore ecosystems to a pre-disturbance or pre-human state.\n\nBut in many places – including islands like Hawaii and New Zealand, where so many species of plants and animals have gone extinct and non-native species have spread so far – turning back the clock was clearly impossible. This idea of \"practical unrestorability\" became the hallmark of what a novel ecosystem is, says Higgs.\n\nFaced with these challenges, ecologists began to question how useful it would be to follow traditional conservation strategies, such as eradicating non-native \"invasive\" species – typically defined as an introduced species that harms its new environment. But it is not always easy, in much-changed environments, to identify which species these are.\n\nJef Vizentin-Bugoni A researcher removes a caught bird from mistnet on O'ahu (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)\n\nTake, for example, the packs of feral donkeys or \"burros\" that roam the American South and Australia, the descendants of working animals once used widely in mines and mills that were turned loose decades ago. In places where feral donkeys and horses have competed with native herbivores and overgrazed plants, some local governments have resorted to large-scale culls.\n\nBut research has shown that donkeys also dig water holes – known as wells or \"ass holes\" – in many cases providing the only water source in drylands where temperatures can reach almost 50C (122F). In the Sonoran Desert, which spans the US and Northern Mexico, these holes support more than 50 other species, including birds and large native mammals such as mule deer. Mountain lions have even been observed eating donkeys.\n\nMeanwhile in Australia, introduced megafauna – from feral horses and donkeys to camels and water buffalo – often make drylands more functionally similar to the ancient past, when 200kg (440lb) giant wombats dug holes in the country's interior, Svenning's research has shown.\n\nYet for nature lovers brought up to value pristine environments, and having long ago learned of the destruction wrought by invasive black rats or cane toads, novel ecosystems challenge many of the fundamental values that have driven conservation for decades. In 2011, when the writer Emma Marris published the influential book Rambunctious Garden, which explored novel ecosystems, critics responded that she was giving permission to \"trash nature\". Like Marris, many urban communities have come to love novel environments that have arisen in their local neighbourhoods. Mount Sutro, for example, a forest of non-native eucalyptus, has become a much-loved park in San Francisco, says Higgs.\n\nAs climate change and nature-loss continue, ecologists are adapting their language to acknowledge that many ecosystems have \"novel elements\" or degrees of \"ecological novelty\". A new map published by researchers in March 2025, tracked how ecosystems across the planet were being changed by climate change, the loss of key animals and native plants being replaced by invasive species. Matthew Kerr, a researcher in Svenning's lab at Aarhus University who made the map, says he found that novel habitats are now truly global, with more than half of the earth's land highly changed: \"This extended out to protected areas,\" he says, including nature parks and marine reserves.\n\nResponding to these findings, ecologist Anna Walentowitz at the University of Bayreuth in Germany wrote that ecological novelty is now the \"new normal\" for our planet, forcing us to question how we protect nature today.\n\nDiscovering what works\n\nO'ahu, at least, is teaching us important lessons that can help protect other environments not yet so degraded, including other islands where native ecosystems remain healthier, says Vizentin-Bugoni. Research has spotlighted certain species that set alarm bells ringing, as they are most likely to do harm to surrounding ecosystems.\n\nJef Vizentin-Bugoni Fruits can be collected on O'ahu which originate from all over the world (Credit: Jef Vizentin-Bugoni)\n\n\"For the plants, the ones that are most likely to be a problem are the ones that fruit for a long period and also have small seeds,\" he says. Both these characteristics increase the chance of being eaten by birds and spread around rapidly.\n\nOn O'ahu itself, research into novel ecosystems is guiding more unconventional conservation strategies. Most land managers are aiming to safeguard the 87% of native plants threatened with extinction by meticulously removing invasive plant species from \"these tiny restoration sites\", explains Tarwater. Although this allows native plants to grow without competition, these denuded areas quickly become bird-free zones, she says. \"There's not enough fruit in those areas to attract them there, which isn't good [for native plants], if those are the only things left to disperse their fruits.\"\n\nTo get the birds to spread native plants around, the team in O'ahu instead try to trick them. They use speakers to play the calls of \"birds that we know are really good seed dispersers\" to lure them to restoration sites where native plants remained, Tarwater says. \"Once they're there, they're like: 'Oh, hey, look at that fruit!' and they'll eat it.\" (Read about how scientists coax back species with sound in other parts of the world too.)\n\nSuch strategies work with non-native birds to help conserve the tiny patches of remaining native plants – although many roles, such as the moa-nalos' dispersal of large seeds, are still not filled, as no non-native species are big enough.\n\nIt all makes unravelling what to do with these novel habitats difficult. \"It's complex and depends on the goals of restoration,\" says Tarwater. A conservationist focusing on native plants may eradicate as many non-native competitors as possible, she says. \"But if you're interested in conserving a native snail or some of these other species, that [non-native plant] might be the habitat that they currently rely upon.\"\n\nWhile novel ecosystems remain controversial, on O'ahu, conservationists and land managers have become less black-and-white about native and non-native species, says Tarwater.\n\n\"We know that the challenges of the novel ecosystems are going to remain, and likely increase. We know that it's not as simple as them being good or bad.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

    "content": "'Food is a language everyone understands': Yotam Ottolenghi on how cuisine connects people\n\n28 March 2025 Share Save Christopher Luu Share Save\n\nNatassja Ebert (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\nThe famed chef and author tells the BBC's Katty Kay that it was finding academia too “esoteric” that led him to seek out a simpler path: to help the world simplify its food.\n\nYotam Ottolenghi's singular style of cooking has been embraced across the globe. Focusing on simple ingredients and treating food as a way to bring friends and family together, he's become a renowned chef, a best-selling author and a touchstone for home cooks looking to incorporate global flavours into their everyday rotations.\n\nThe chef, father and former philosophy student explains to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, in her interview series Influential, that having parents who cooked helped shape his path. However, he says that it was the sense of belonging that came with cooking – not family expectations – that truly drew him in.\n\n\"There was a quiet expectation that I would probably become an academic,\" he says. \"I don't remember having a conversation, which must have happened. 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' I don't remember that.\"\n\nHis parents were both in education – his father, Michael, was a chemistry professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University – but Ottolenghi notes that his folks both had experience in the kitchen.\n\nNatassja Ebert Ottolenghi became a household name after the opening of his restaurant in Notting Hill (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\n\"Food was very important. We had good ingredients, good cooking. Both my parents were good cooks,\" he says. \"My father used to cook a lot because he worked more flexible hours. My mother was a head teacher at school [...] She also cooked but he cooked even more.\"\n\nThe 56-year-old chef – who has authored 11 cookbooks – tells Kay that rather than having an epiphany about his future path, he saw the kitchen as a space for curiosity and play, something that he's now passed onto his own children.\n\n\"My kids – I've got a 9 year old [and an] 11 year old – they play, you know?\" he says. \"They go in the kitchen and they make an omelette and this and that. I call it cooking as play. So, I used to do a bit of that but I wasn't obsessive about cooking.\"\n\nFood should be healing rather than routine, says Ottolenghi\n\nBefore making his name in the culinary world, Ottolenghi dabbled in philosophy but found the subject matter too isolating and \"esoteric\".\n\n\"The conversation was being held amongst a group of, like, four people, you know like groundbreaking stuff but actually nobody was participating,\" he said of his time in university, where he tackled topics like the meaning of photography and what images mean to their viewers. Instead of that very specialised field, he turned his focus to something simpler, literally.\n\nNatassja Ebert Ottolenghi says his approach to cooking has changed as he's seen the public's shifting attitudes to food (Credit: Natassja Ebert)\n\nIn 2018, following the success of his eponymous Notting Hill café and shop, Ottolenghi published his fifth cookbook, Simple, distilling all the techniques and preparations that he'd become known for into something accessible and approachable.\n\n\"Food is a language that everybody understands,\" he says. What surprised him about that, however, was that the books started to eclipse the food. \"Rather than just being a book to sell and share, the publishing arm of Ottolenghi became the dog wagging the tail in this respect. The books became the main thing, almost.\"\n\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay Watch Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on YouTube.\n\nThe books were a way for fans of the restaurant and of Ottolenghi's pared-down, flavour-forward recipes to access that world at home. He tells Kay that he hopes to be part of a movement to take cooking from being a chore into something healing and restorative.\n\n\"Home-style cooking and family-style serving are way more popular now than they used to be. I really put that down to, first of all, cost of living, but also Covid. In that moment, we understood that actually food should be healing rather than just one of all other activities that we do all day long that push us.\"\n\nFans soon saw the changes in his books, shifting from the exact recipes served at his restaurants to something less haute cuisine and more streamlined, boasting titles like Simple, Plenty and his latest, Comfort.\n\n\"I think since Simple, I have been spending more of my time thinking, 'What does it actually mean to cook this recipe?' You know, 'When do I cook – when does one cook it? How much effort goes into it?'\" he says. \"Funnily, from a grand old age talking to younger chefs, I say to them, 'Is someone actually going to cook this?' I want people to cook my food.\"\n\nThat pared-down approach has even turned \"Ottolenghi\" into an adjective – used to describe food that offers high impact with few ingredients and straightforward techniques. He remains humble, brushing off the distinction and putting the focus back on his desire to make cooking comforting.\n\n\"Food really is one of those activities that shouldn't induce anxiety. It's as simple as that,\" he says.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

    "content": "'Banal and hollow': Why the quaint paintings of Thomas Kinkade divided the US\n\n28 March 2025 Share Save Nicholas Barber Share Save\n\n(Image credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nBeloved by many, despised by others, Thomas Kinkade's quaint rustic scenes and his wholesome image belied a dark and tortured story that contrasts with his 'sugary' artworks.\n\nThomas Kinkade was one of the best-selling artists in history, as well as one of the most divisive. When he died in 2012, the American painter had been rocked by business problems, but at his commercial peak a decade earlier, his company was bringing in more than $100m a year. And yet his work was despised by many critics – not because it was blasphemous or obscene, but because, well, he specialised in quaint pictures of thatched-roof rural cottages nestling in leafy groves. \"Thomas Kinkade's style is illustrative saccharine fantasy rather than art with which you can connect at any meaningful level,\" Charlotte Mullins, the author of A Little History of Art, tells the BBC. \"It is schmaltzy pastiches of Disney-style woodland scenes, complete with cutesy animals and fairy tale cottages. They are… like the images you find on cheap greetings cards – sugary and forgettable.\" And compared to some critics, Mullins is being polite.\n\nHis branding was so effective that you didn't know there was this really complicated and I would say tortured artist behind it all – Miranda Yousef\n\nThese critics don't just consider Kinkade's paintings to be nauseatingly sickly, they detect something disturbing and ominous about them. In her 2003 book on California, Where I Was From, Joan Didion summed up his art by saying. \"It typically featured a cottage or a house of such insistent cosiness as to seem actually sinister, suggestive of a trap designed to attract Hansel and Gretel. Every window was lit, to lurid effect, as if the interior of the structure might be on fire.\" As harsh as that sounds, Didion may have been more perceptive than she realised. Art for Everybody, a new documentary directed by Miranda Yousef, shows that the man who called himself the \"Painter of Light\" did indeed have a dark side. \"His branding was so effective that you didn't know there was this really complicated and I would say tortured artist behind it all,\" Yousef tells the BBC. \"He lived a Greek tragedy of a life.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade specialised in quaint pictures of rural cottages, which were loved by many, but despised by critics (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nThe documentary features audio tapes recorded by Kinkade when he was a long-haired, bohemian-looking art student in California in the 1970s – and even then, he was already fretting over the question of whether he could make an impact as an artist while making a decent living. After a stint in Hollywood, painting backgrounds for Ralph Bakshi's 1983 animated feature film, Fire and Ice, he concentrated on idealised, nostalgic American landscapes, and he and his wife Nanette sold reproductions of them outside a local grocer's shop. In the 1990s, he took the idealism and the nostalgia to new heights, and swapped his rugged vistas for soft-focus pastoral scenes that a Hobbit might deem a bit on the twee side. Old-fashioned lampposts and cottage windows glowed. Streams twinkled beneath slender stone footbridges. Bushes burst with pastel flowers. And cash registers rang. Kinkade didn't sell the paintings themselves, but the hazy idylls they depicted were soon being printed on collectible plates advertised in newspapers and magazines. For many Americans, they were comforting refuges from the modern world.\n\nToday we would think they had been produced by AI, designed as if by algorithm to a certain formula – Charlotte Mullins\n\nIn Art for Everybody, Christopher Knight, the art critic of the Los Angeles Times, is contemptuous of Kinkade's imagery. \"It's a cliché piled upon a fantasy piled upon a bad idea,\" he says. \"The colour is juiced and the light coming from inside those cottages is intense and blaring.\" Just as importantly, as far as his critics were concerned, Kinkade's pictures had nothing to them beyond their superficial decorative qualities. \"They are banal and hollow, with no intent to say anything meaningful,\" says Mullins. \"Today we would think they had been produced by AI – designed as if by algorithm to a certain formula.\" But Yousef insists that Kinkade's skill can't be discounted. \"There were actually other people who were painting cottages and Christmas scenes and putting them on plates and all that stuff,\" she notes, \"and the thing is that Kinkade's were so much better. His works just blew everybody else's out of the water.\"\n\nShe also believes that Kinkade's paintings, rather than being wholly market-led, were linked to his childhood in Placerville, California, where he was raised by his single mother and only intermittently saw his violent father. \"It's a common criticism that his cottages look like they're on fire on the inside. And then you learn that it was because when he was growing up it was always cold and dark in the house when he got home, because they didn't have the money to keep the heat and the lights on. He was painting the thing that he wanted.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade focused on idealised, nostalgic American landscapes, before swapping his rugged vistas for soft-focus pastoral scenes (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nKinkade's deprived upbringing, says Yousef, didn't just inspire his choice of subject matter, but drove him to make as much money as he could. He and his business partners printed pictures on an industrial scale, as well as putting his immediately recognisable imagery on furniture and ornaments, and selling them on the QVC shopping network. They also set up hundreds of faux olde worlde Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries in shopping malls around the US, and trademarked the \"Painter of Light\" brand. Again, Yousef doesn't see Kinkade as entirely calculating. Having grown up in a house with no pictures on the walls, \"He sincerely believed that art should be accessible to everyone.\"\n\nBehind the fantasy\n\nWhatever you thought of the paintings, the mass-marketing of the work of a single artist was certainly groundbreaking. In interviews at the time, Kinkade asserted that he was no different from an author selling stacks of novels or a musician selling CDs. He even declared that by industrialising his output, he was doing what Andy Warhol had always dreamt of. But Mullins argues that Kinkade was being \"obfuscatory and disingenuous\" by churning out reproductions by the thousand, paying his assistants to add a few dabs of paint here and there, and then selling these prints for thousands of dollars, as if they were rare and precious works of art. \"Prints offer an affordable way of buying art by great artists,\" she says. \"They retain their value through the limited nature of the edition. This was never Kinkade's strategy.\"\n\nThe Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade printed pictures and merchandise on an industrial scale and trademarked the \"Painter of Light\" brand (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation)\n\nStill, this sort of disagreement between Kinkade and his critics was one of his selling points. Art for Everybody features news reports and promotional videos, in which he tells adoring audiences that his art could be understood and appreciated by everyone, whereas only the snooty elite could see anything artistic about Chris Ofili putting elephant dung on his canvases, or Tracey Emin presenting her unmade bed to gallery-goers. \"This is not legitimate art,\" he proclaimed. As much a televangelist as a painter, Kinkade was a born-again Christian who assured his devotees that buying his work put them on the right side of a political and spiritual line separating them from decadent metropolitan tastemakers. He trademarked the sobriquet \"Painter of Light\", not just because of all the sunlit clouds and fiery cottages in his pictures, but to signify that he was a force for virtue and Christianity. \"The art world is a world of darkness today,\" he thundered. He, in contrast, was \"someone who stands up for family and God and country and beauty\". A doughy, plaid shirt-wearing fellow with a thick moustache, he often appeared on television with his blonde wife and his four blonde daughters: the embodiment of wholesome, traditional, all-American values. His fans weren't just paying for his pictures; they were paying to associate themselves with this proudly conservative persona.\n\nBut that persona, like the pictures themselves, was more a fantasy that Kinkade wished for than an accurate representation of reality. He was prone to swearing after the directors of his mawkishvideos called \"cut\". He relied on alcohol to cope with work pressures. And, in the documentary, his daughters say that they were encouraged to smile in videos and personal appearances, but often felt as if their father cared more about his career than about them. \"Thomas Kinkade and his persona and his brand really cast an extraordinarily long, dark shadow over his entire family,\" says Yousef, \"and there was a lot wrapped up in perpetuating the brand and preserving it.\"\n\nIn order to maintain this brand and the vast business empire that went with it, Kinkade had to present himself as a Christian paragon, and he had to complete a stylistically identical painting every month. That meant that he had to suppress other, more conflicted parts of his psyche. The strain became too much. In the mid-2000s, Kinkade fell out with his business partners, and had legal battles with gallery franchisees. He reinvented himself as a womanising, hard-drinking hellraiser. After some interventions by his friends and family, some time in rehab, and the collapse of his marriage, he died of an accidental overdose of alcohol and diazepam at the age of 54.\n\nArt for Everybody The documentary Art for Everybody explores the dark, troubled person behind the wholesome persona Kinkade had created (Credit: Art for Everybody)\n\nIt was only after his death that his family sorted through the vault containing his artwork, and uncovered a stash of bleak, violent drawings and paintings that seemed to express his inner rage and fear in a way that his cottage paintings never could: a shack in the middle of nowhere on a murky night; a nun pointing a gun at herself; giant monsters and distorted faces. Art for Everybody raises the questions of whether these pictures are more authentic than the ones the public knew about. Do they express how Kinkade really felt about his difficult upbringing and his frightening father? Would it have been healthier for him to explore the shadowy netherworlds in these pictures instead of shutting himself inside his stifling sylvan cottages, year after year? And were his critics right to say that his famous paintings were disturbing all along? \"One of the things that was obvious early on,\" says Yousef, \"was that his fans had a two-dimensional view of him and his critics had another completely different two-dimensional view of him. I knew there was a three-dimensional person in there somewhere, and that's what I wanted to try to find.\"\n\nIn some ways, Kinkade was ahead of his time. First, he was a culture warrior before culture wars were being fought as fiercely as they are now. As someone who claimed that he was taking a stand for Christianity and patriotism and against the intellectual elite, he was staking out territory occupied by more and more in the US today. He was also ahead of his time as an artist with such a brazen commercial side. \"Today we're seeing all these artist collabs,\" says Yousef. \"There's Yayoi Kusama who's working with Louis Vuitton, and Tom Sachs is working with Nike, and Kehinde Wiley is doing a collab with American Express, whereas you see in the movie an MBNA bank card with a Thomas Kinkade painting on it. He was already doing it 20 or 30 years ago.\"\n\nFinally, by calling himself the Painter of Light, and by trading on his pious family-man persona, Kinkade turned himself into a kind of product. \"Look at where we are today with social media, and everybody being a brand,\" says Yousef. \"He was really ahead of his time with that. But I think that one of the big questions of the film is, what are the costs of turning yourself into a brand?\" In Kinkade's case, the costs were unbearably high.\n\nArt for Everybody is released on 28 March in the US.\n\n--",

    "content": "Lithuania's fermented drink to ward off a cold\n\n15 March 2025 Share Save Michelle Tchea Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nSweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic – and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\n\nWhen Tadas Eidukevičius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevičiusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things – it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevičius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\n\nWhile Eidukevičius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity – particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce – in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\n\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė The fermentation process produces a slightly carbonated drink that's full of \"good\" bacteria (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria – meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\n\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick – consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva Šidlaitė, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\n\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus – like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė Kvass is often made with fruit or vegetables, with beetroot being a popular option (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\n\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\n\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogailė Čojūtė, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\n\nIeva Šidlaitė In Lithuania, traditionalists see gira as a tonic for the common cold (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\n\nWhere to try Gira In Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmyninė, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\n\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation’s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\n\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says Čojūtė.\n\nInstead, Eidukevičius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevičius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\n\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevičius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

    "content": "The vital tradition of naming baby gorillas\n\n3 days ago Share Save Kate Lewis Share Save\n\nKwita Izina\n\nMountain gorilla conservation in Rwanda is a global success story, partly due to the significance and value placed on gorillas as part of the nation's culture and heritage, with annual celebrations of baby gorillas being born.\n\nIn a sunlit spot of mist-cloaked rainforest, a black, hairy mass of muscle descends surprisingly gracefully down a thick mossy vine. The huge silverback stretches out and settles in for a thorough grooming session from a female, totally unfazed by his human admirers. Two teenagers tumble into view, beating their chests and grimacing at each other, a tangle of limbs in mock combat, while an adorable baby gorilla peers shyly from her mother's arms at the unfolding family drama.\n\nSeeing mountain gorillas in the wild is a magical bucket list experience, but it wasn't always this way. Poachers decimated gorilla numbers in the 1960s and 70s, leaving them at risk of extinction. Then came the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Volcanoes National Park, home to most of Rwanda's mountain gorillas, became a battlefield as the civil war raged across the country, with population numbers struggling to rise above 300.\n\nIt's hard to fathom how Rwanda has managed to tackle the challenges of its traumatic past in such a short space of time, let alone become a beacon of conservation success. Yet today, mountain gorillas are the only great ape whose numbers are not rapidly descending. WWF estimates that mountain gorilla numbers have risen 3% every year since 2010, moving them in the right direction from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species – and this success largely comes down to Rwanda's sustained conservation efforts, which include anti-poaching patrols, community engagement and regulated gorilla tourism, all of which have helped to protect habitats and ensure that local people benefit from the survival of these great apes.\n\nThree hundred and ninety-five baby gorillas have been born since 2005 in Rwanda, and each year since then these new arrivals have been celebrated in a uniquely Rwandan way. Kwita Izina, or \"to give a name\" in the country's national Kinyarwanda language, is Rwanda's huge annual gorilla naming ceremony that honours each gorgeous fuzzy baby born in Volcanoes National Park with a meaningful moniker. The ceremony, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, is inspired by the centuries-old Rwandan tradition where families and communities would gather together to name their newborns. Since Kwita Izina began, it has played a major role in raising awareness of gorilla conservation.\n\nAlamy As well as raising global awareness, Kwita Izina is also a way of saying thank you to the communities and conservationists who protect the animals (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"It's a great story of success to mark this progress of a species that was in decline and on the edge,\" says Praveen Moman, founder of Volcanoes Safaris and the first international tour operator to kickstart gorilla tourism in Rwanda after the genocide. \"First it was small and local and symbolic, just for the rangers and those involved in conservation. Now the government has made this an international and recognisable event to highlight conservation success.\"\n\nRwandans place great significance on a person's name, and so the button-cute babies are given names based on their personality or events surrounding them at the time of their birth. Last year actor Idris Elba named a baby gorilla \"Narame\", meaning \"long life\", because its mother had previously lost two children; and primary school student Elvine Ineza named a female baby \"Nibagwire\", meaning \"multiply\" and chosen to wish the newly formed Sigasirie family continued growth.\n\nTens of thousands of people, including celebrities, conservationists and local communities, now come together at the foothills of the ancient volcanoes for the annual spectacle held every autumn (the confirmed date for 2025 has yet to be announced by the Rwanda Development Board). As well as the official ceremony, dominated by a house-high bamboo gorilla sculpture, there are hours of music, dances and performances from the warrior-like Intore dancers pounding the ground in time to drums to cultural villages showcasing Rwandan daily life.\n\nAs well as raising global awareness, Kwita Izina is also a cultural celebration of the country's collective efforts to protect the great apes and a way of saying thank you to the communities and conservationists who protect them. Irene Murerwa, chief tourism officer of the Rwanda Development Board tells the BBC that Kwita Izina serves the purpose of thanking the local community before everything else. \"It's because of the community and it's for them as well,\" she says.\n\nKwita Izina Kwita Izina is inspired by Rwanda's traditional of families and communities gathering together to name newborn babies (Credit: Kwita Izina)\n\nTiming a visit to Volcanoes National Park during Kwita Izina is highly worthwhile, but the meaning behind it is really what's key, according to Murerwa. \"It's not just the baby gorilla naming ceremony. It's the whole aspect of visiting. Guests can take advantage to understand how communities, tourism and conservation come together here,\" she says.\n\nA dramatic blend of striking volcanic mountains, ethereal montane forests and neat, terraced hills that roll endlessly across the countryside, Rwanda is tiny but one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Space is limited, so people living near the gorillas must have incentives to protect them. \"If you want to save the gorillas you need to focus on the people, because these are tiny, fragile habitats, surrounded by some of the most densely populated areas of the world,\" says Moman.\n\nPlan your trip How to get here: Fly into Rwanda's capital Kigali. From Kigali, it takes between two to three hours to drive to Volcanoes National Park's headquarters in Kinigi, Musanze, where the naming ceremony is also held. Lodges usually provide transfers or car hire and taxi services are available. When to go: The long dry season between May and October. Kwita Izina is usually held every autumn. Where to stay : Virunga Lodge , Wilderness Sabyinyo and Red Rocks Rwanda. What to do: Gorillas are the star attraction but golden monkeys are also endemic here (permits are needed for both). If visiting during the week-long Kwita Izina festivities, organise tickets through your lodge or tour operator.\n\n\"Unless local people see some specific benefit from tourism and conservation, there's no reason why they should support the future of the gorillas, and equally importantly, the future of the habitat. What they need is farmland and bread on the table. From the small number of visitors, you need to make enough of an impact through the income and make sure that some of it is shared with the community.\"\n\nMore than 1.4 million travellers visited Rwanda in 2023, generating a record US$620m. At $1,500 per permit, watching gorillas is an eye-wateringly expensive experience. Yet, income from gorilla tourism provides vital funding for the continued protection of the park and animals within and, crucially, 10% of the park fee revenue goes to the people who live around the park margins to help build schools and houses, improve infrastructure and sanitation, provide clean water and support health centres. This impactful funding has transformed villages and encourages stewardship of the forests.\n\nAlamy The ceremony, which includes music and dance performances, is dominated by a huge bamboo gorilla sculpture (Credit: Alamy)\n\nTourism now also provides thousands of people with livelihoods. Greg Bakunzi, founder of Red Rocks Rwanda, a social enterprise integrating tourism, conservation and sustainable community development in and around the Volcanoes National Park, says, \"Kwita Izina helped to mobilise communities and people who were interested in conservation and tourism to be a part of the growing tourism industry.\"\n\nRed Rocks Rwanda offers safari tent accommodation, gorilla trekking and many immersive activities throughout the year for visitors, and Bakunzi now also hosts the annual Red Rocks Cultural Festival that aligns with the dates of Kwita Izina and features music, poetry, comedy, art, exhibitions and talks about conservation and community empowerment.\n\n\"I wanted to create a week-long event that could also integrate community conservation when travellers come for the naming ceremony,\" he says. \"The culture of the communities are intricately tied to the natural world surrounding them. They preserve not only the Virungu Mountain environment but also the historical cultures and traditional arts of the region, gaining access to sustainable sources of income from tourism.\"\n\nOver at the Gorilla Guardians Village in the small town of Kinigi, which is also home to the park headquarters, former poachers have swapped snares for stories. Visitors can immerse themselves in Rwandan dance, craft and food, make Rwanda's potent banana beer, learn traditional skills like fire-making and archery and hear the tales of the people who used to hunt in the forest. Also in Kinigi, upscale Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge is Rwanda's first community-owned lodge. The pretty stone cottages and access to gorilla trekking provide an income for many local people and also support healthcare, infrastructure and education projects, such as building homes for widows of the Rwandan genocide and new classrooms for children.\n\nKwita Izina Rwanda has been naming baby gorillas since 2005, with this year the 20th anniversary of the tradition (Credit: Kwita Izina)\n\nEunice Umumararungu, assistant manager at Sabyinyo, told me, \"Everyone's job is vital to successful conservation. From the porters, trackers and guides to research partners, rangers and those who are involved in the tree planting initiatives – they are all ensuring future naming ceremonies as the gorilla population grows thanks to conservation efforts. Kwita Izina has helped all Rwandans from various communities to understand the value of gorillas and their contribution to the country's economic prosperity.\"\n\nCementing the region as a conservation hub is the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, which opened in 2022 just outside the park. As well as being an education and research centre for the next generation of conservation leaders, visitors can take quizzes to find out which gorilla matches their personality, leaf through Fossey's field notes in a highly realistic version of the acclaimed primatologist's research camp and explore 12 acres of beautifully landscaped grounds.\n\nGorilla families are doing so well now that Volcanoes National Park is being expanded to give them more space. In addition, a Conservation Master Plan, published later this year, will set out guidance for the protection and management of all Rwandan biodiversity. As people are seen as important stewards of conservation in this nation, those who will have to relocate out of the expanded national park will be supported with new livelihood opportunities and improved living conditions.\n\n\"Kwita Izina has really put our name on the map,\" says Bakunzi. \"It has brought us more global visibility and has shown people why conservation matters.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Two years after the terrifying accident, BBC reporter Chris Brasher went to find what happened when the US lost a hydrogen bomb.\n\nOn 7 April 1966, almost 60 years ago this week, a missing nuclear weapon for which the US military had been desperately searching for 80 days was finally found. The warhead, with an explosive power 100 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, was carefully winched from a depth of 2,850ft (869m) out of the Mediterranean Sea and delicately lowered onto the USS Petrel. Once it was on board, officers painstakingly cut into the thermonuclear device's casing to disarm it. It was only then that everyone could breathe a sigh of relief – the last of the four hydrogen bombs that the US had accidentally dropped on Spain had been recovered.\n\n\"This was not the first accident involving nuclear weapons,\" said BBC reporter Chris Brasher when he reported from the scene in 1968. \"The Pentagon lists at least nine previous accidents to aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs. But this was the first accident on foreign soil, the first to involve civilians and the first to excite the attention of the world.\"\n\n'I was paralysed with fear. A stone hit me in the stomach, I thought I'd been killed'\n\nThis terrifying situation had come about because of a US operation code-named Chrome Dome. At the beginning of the 1960s, the US had developed a project to deter its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union, from launching a pre-emptive strike. A patrol of nuclear-armed B-52 bombers would continuously criss-cross the skies, primed to attack Moscow at a moment's notice. But to stay airborne on these long looping routes, the planes needed to refuel while in flight.\n\nOn 17 January 1966, one such bomber was flying at a height of 31,000ft (9.5km) over the Almería region of southern Spain, and attempted a routine air-to-air refuelling with a KC-135 tanker plane. \"I believe what happened was the bomber was closing at a too-high rate of closure speed and he didn't stabilise his position,\" US Maj Gen Delmar Wilson, the man in charge of dealing with the catastrophic accident, told Brasher, \"with the result that they got too close and collided.\"\n\nThe B-52 bomber's impact with the refuelling plane tore it open, igniting the jet fuel the KC-135 was carrying and killing all four of the crew onboard. The ensuing explosion also killed two men in the B-52's tail section. A third managed to eject, but died when his parachute did not open. The other four members of the bomber's crew successfully bailed out of their burning plane before it broke apart and fell to earth, raining down both flaming aircraft fragments and its lethal thermonuclear cargo onto the remote Spanish village of Palomares.\n\nEveryone kept talking about a 'broken arrow'. I learnt then that 'broken arrow' was the code word for a nuclear accident – Capt Joe Ramirez\n\nThe huge fireball was seen a mile away. Thankfully, it did not trigger a nuclear explosion. The bomber's warheads were not armed and had built-in safeguards to prevent an unintended atomic chain reaction. But the thermonuclear devices did have explosives surrounding their plutonium cores as part of the triggering mechanism. In the event of an accident, the bombs had parachutes attached to them designed to cushion the impact on landing and prevent radioactive contamination. And indeed, one undetonated bomb did land safely in a riverbed and was recovered intact the following day. Unfortunately, two of the plummeting nuclear bombs' parachutes failed to open.\n\nThat morning, Spanish farmer Pedro Alarcón was walking to his house with his grandchildren when one of the nuclear bombs landed in his tomato field and blew apart on impact. \"We were blown flat. The children started to cry. I was paralysed with fear. A stone hit me in the stomach, I thought I'd been killed. I lay there feeling like death with the children crying,\" he told the BBC in 1968.\n\nDevastation and chaos\n\nThe other hydrogen bomb also exploded when it hit the ground near a cemetery. These dual blasts created vast craters and scattered highly toxic, radioactive plutonium dust across several hundred acres. Burning aircraft debris also showered the Spanish village. \"I was crying and running about,\" a villager called Señora Flores told the BBC in 1968. \"My little girl was crying, 'Mama, Mama, look at our house, it is burning.' Because of all the smoke I thought what she said must be true. There were a lot of stones and debris falling around us. I thought it would hit us. It was this terrific explosion. We thought it was the end of the world.\"\n\nOnce the news that the bomber had come down with nuclear weapons aboard reached US military command, a huge operation was launched. At the time of the disaster, Capt Joe Ramirez was an US Air Force lawyer stationed in Madrid. \"There were a lot of people talking, there was a lot of excitement in the conference room. Everyone kept talking about a 'broken arrow'. I learnt then that 'broken arrow' was the code word for a nuclear accident,\" he told BBC's Witness History in 2011.\n\nUS military personnel were scrambled to the area by helicopter. When Capt Ramirez arrived in Palomares, he immediately saw the devastation and chaos wrought by the accident. Huge pieces of smoking wreckage were strewn all over the area – a large part of the burning B-52 bomber had landed in the school's yard. \"It's a small village but there were people scrambling in different directions. I could see smouldering debris, I could see some fires.\"\n\nIN HISTORY In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\n\nDespite the carnage, miraculously no one in the village was killed. \"Nearly 100 tonnes of flaming debris had fallen on the village but not even a chicken had died,\" said Brasher. A local school teacher and doctor climbed up to the fire-scarred hillside to retrieve the remains of the US airmen who had been killed. \"Later still, they sorted the pieces and the limbs into five coffins, an act that was to cause a certain amount of bureaucratic difficulty when the Americans came to claim only four bodies from that hillside,\" said Brasher.\n\nThree of the B-52 crew who managed to eject landed in the Mediterranean several miles off the coast and were rescued by local fishing boats within an hour of the accident. The fourth, the B-52 radar-navigator, ejected through the plane's explosion, which left him badly burned, and was unable to separate himself from his ejection seat. Despite this, he managed to open his parachute and was found alive near the village and taken to hospital.\n\nHowever, this still left the problem of locating the plane's deadly nuclear payload. \"My main concern was to recover those bombs, that was number-one priority,\" Gen Wilson told the BBC in 1968.\n\nOne of our nuclear bombs is missing\n\n\"The first night, the Guardia Civil [the Spanish national police force] had come to the little bar in Palomares, and that was about the only place that had electricity. And they had reported what they considered to be a bomb, so we immediately despatched some of our people to this riverbed which is not far from the centre of town, and, in fact, it was a bomb, so we placed a guard on that. And then the next morning, at first daylight, we started conducting our search, and I believe it was something in the order of 10am or 11am the following morning, we located two other bombs.\"\n\nThis accounted for three of the nuclear bombs, but there was still one missing. By the next day, trucks filled with US troops had been sent from nearby bases, with the beach in Palomares becoming a base for some 700 US airmen and scientists urgently trying to contain any radioactive contamination and locate the fourth warhead.\n\n\"The first thing that you could see as the search really got underway in earnest was Air Force personnel linking up hand-by-hand and 40 or 50 people in a line. They would have designated search areas. There were some people with Geiger counters who started arriving, and so they started marking off the areas which were contaminated,\" said Capt Ramirez in 2011. When US personnel registered an area contaminated with radiation, they would scrape up the first three inches of topsoil and seal it in barrels to be shipped back to the US. Some 1,400 tonnes of irradiated soil ended up being sent to a storage facility in South Carolina.\n\nBoth the US and Spain, which at the time was under the brutal rule of Francisco Franco's military dictatorship, were keen to downplay the devastating accident. Franco was especially worried that radiation fears would hurt Spain's tourism industry, a major source of revenue for his regime. In an effort to reassure the local population and the wider world that there was no danger, the US Ambassador to Spain, Angier Biddle Duke, would end up taking a swim in the sea off Palomares coast in front of the international press just weeks after the accident.\n\nBut despite hundreds of US personnel conducting an intensive and meticulous search of the surrounding area for a week, they still couldn't find the fourth bomb. Then Capt Ramirez spoke to a local fisherman who had helped rescue some of the surviving airmen who had splashed down in the sea. The fisherman kept apologising to Capt Ramirez for not being able to save one of the US flyers, whom he thought he had witnessed drifting down into the depths.\n\nCapt Ramirez realised that the fisherman could have actually seen the missing nuclear bomb. \"All the bodies had been accounted for, I knew that,\" he said. The search then quickly shifted to the Mediterranean Sea, with the US Navy mobilising a flotilla of more than 30 ships, including mine-sweepers and submersibles, to scour the seabed. The exploration of miles of ocean floor was both technically complicated and a very slow process, but after weeks of exhaustive searching, a newly developed deep-diving vessel, Alvin, finally located the missing bomb in an underwater trench.\n\nNearly four months after it was first lost, the warhead was finally made safe and back in US hands. The next day, despite the secrecy with which the US military had surrounding its nuclear arsenal, it took the unusual step of showing the bomb to the world's press. Ambassador Duke reasoned that unless people saw the bomb for themselves, they would never feel certain that it had actually been recovered.\n\nAlmost six decades later, the incident still casts a long shadow over the Almería region. The US clean-up operation managed to miss some areas of contamination, and the US and Spain agreed to fund yearly health-checks for Palomares residents. They also promised to monitor the soil, the water, the air and local crops. But there are still some 100 acres (40 hectares) of contaminated land in Palomares that remain fenced off. And despite Spain and the US signing a mutual agreement in 2015 to clean up the area, neither has yet complied.\n\n--\n\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

Why The White Lotus season three divided fans and critics\n\n8 hours ago Share Save Laura Martin Share Save\n\nFabio Lovino/ HBO\n\nRight from the start, season three of Mike White's Thailand-set one percenter drama was beset by criticism and debate – where will the series go from here?\n\nWithin seconds of the highly anticipated final episode of The White Lotus’s season three ending on Sunday evening, the reactions and reviews for the 83-min closer were in. The viewers might as well have been talking about two different shows. \"This was the best season finale so far in The White Lotus universe,\" one person on X commented, while another agreed: \"That episode was a work of art.\" However, others felt \"the ending was a huge flop – built up several plot lines all series to abruptly end them in 20 minutes with no reflection,\" with another saying the finale \"stinks… way too long, very boring\".\n\nThese divisive opinions are reflective of the season as a whole, and were also felt by the critics. Was the third outing of creator Mike White's one-percenter holiday murder-mystery – set previously in luxury resorts in Hawaii, Sicily and, most recently, Koh Samui, Thailand – worthy of what Brian Tallerico of Roger Ebert called his \"favourite season yet\"? Or did the series, as the Boston Globe's Steven Nguyen Scaife put it, have \"less to say than ever… it's comfort food masquerading as social critique\"?\n\nIt was always going to be a tricky feat for White to pull off mass adoration for a third time. The White Lotus, which debuted in 2021, previously won 15 Emmys and two Golden Globes. It marked a comeback role for Jennifer Coolidge, often credited as White's muse, and who portrayed the naive heiress Tanya McQuoid for the first two seasons. The role earned her two Emmys and a Golden Globe, as well as becoming a fan-favourite. But White had pulled the rug out from viewers at the end of season two, killing off Coolidge's much-loved character, leaving fans unsteady and unsure of where a third series would take them – and if it would still have the same impact.\n\nThe trouble with the new series can perhaps be traced back to the opening seconds of season three back in February, when disappointed fans noted that not only was the new theme tune not \"a bop\", but it failed to contain the traditional \"wooo-loo-looos\" sounds of the previous two series. It may have been a minor issue, but was integral to the whole experience, some viewers believed.\n\nJust last week, The White Lotus composer, Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, revealed to The The New York Times that he had quit the show due to \"hysterical\" conversations with the show's producers, adding: \"I texted the producer and I told him that it would be great to, at some point, give them the longer version with the ooh-loo-loo-loos, because people will explode if they realise that it was going there anyway. He thought it was a good idea. But then Mike cut that – he wasn't happy about that. At that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think.\"\n\nAlongside this off-set drama, a common complaint about this season was that White's traditional slow-burn of storytelling was too… slow. The London Evening Standard called it \"agonisingly slow\". Meanwhile, given the star-power of the cast, several characters such as Blackpink's Lalisa Manobal's staff member Mook or The Zone of Interest's Christian Friedel as the resort manager – and aspiring singer – Fabian, felt severely underused and underdeveloped.\n\nFans waiting for a payoff in the finale were disappointed by nothing turning up. \"Manobal, and Christian Friedel, were never really given the chance to shine – and the show felt poorer for it,\" said the Evening Standard. Other long, drawn-out storylines, such as Jason Isaacs' dodgy financial-dealing dad, Tim Ratliff, attempting to kill his family, were never revealed to his family, sadly depriving viewers of the moment when the snobbish Victoria Ratliff (Parker Posey) discovers they were poor.\n\nWhite himself seemed to foreshadow some of this criticism. \"It isn't exactly a crowd-pleaser,\" he told The New Yorker. \"I don't know what it is, but we'll see.\" And at the beginning of the final episode, the Buddhist monk, Luang Por Teera, is shown saying to his students: \"There is no resolution to life's questions. It is easier to be patient once we finally accept there is no resolution.\"\n\nThe White Lotus is appointment TV, and still heads and shoulders above a lot of other television out there\n\nHad the show become a victim of its own success? As the series' feverish Reddit page grew in numbers, so did the fandom's theories, speculations and predictions. This was presumably not something the show was set up for in its debut season, but was something that White appeared to play into across the second and third series: planting hints and suggestions of what might come to pass later in the show, but also red herrings to throw people off the scent again.\n\nWhile some fans may arguably have spoiled the experience for themselves by correctly predicting plot twists in this series – the slightly trope-y revelation of someone's parentage; who was going to die – others may have felt frustrated, and that White overplayed his hand with too many false moments that culminated in ultimately inconsequential storylines or characters.\n\nHowever, some aspects of this series were roundly agreed to be spectacular. The shock return of the series villain, Greg (Jon Gries), which managed to remain a secret until the first episode aired, was a genuine jump scare rare in contemporary television; and a surprise cameo – and an even more shocking monologue – by Sam Rockwell as Frank, a friend of Rick's (Walton Goggins) who is in recovery, will mark the series as unforgettable.\n\nWhite's writing and sharp talent for capturing humanity it all its gore and glory also shone through again. In the final episode, a heartfelt speech by Laurie (Carrie Coon) to her frenemies; noting how the passing of time made her appreciative of their relationship in her life; to Belinda's (Natasha Rothwell) character arc – and White's observation that for the right amount of money, we're all likely to sell out our morals.\n\nIt was these strengths – and arguably the more \"shock\" storylines like the incest brothers threesome; or all the full-frontal penis shots – that meant that even if the show was divisive, it was still pulling the viewers in. According to an HBO spokesperson in the New York Times: \"The second season of The White Lotus, which debuted in October 2022, shot up to more than 15 million viewers, and this season is on track to have at least 18 million\", making it one of HBO's most popular shows of all time.\n\nAnd, as some critics have also pointed out, even if this third season of The White Lotus wasn't at its best, \"bad\" The White Lotus is appointment TV, and still heads and shoulders above a lot of other television out there. \"It is better in its third gear than many dramas are in full throttle,\" commented Carol Midgley from The Times.\n\nThere will now likely be debate over whether White should have agreed to continue with a fourth series of The White Lotus – which was confirmed by HBO before season three began – and speculation as to its new location and new cast. White has shown that he still has the power to draw in the audiences; but will the destination be worth another journey?\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

    "content": "'The forgotten Monet': How masterful paintings by the artist's stepdaughter are finally getting recognition\n\n6 days ago Share Save Lucy Davies Share Save\n\nArt Institute of Chicago/ Arthur M Wood/ Collection of Alice and Rick Johnson\n\nBlanche Hoschedé-Monet has barely been acknowledged in art history. But not only did she help her stepfather Claude, she created her own fine works – often of the same scenes as him.\n\nHaystack at Giverny, Poplars at the Water's Edge, Morning on the Seine. These painting titles bring only one name to mind – the great Claude Monet, whose flickering evocations of light and atmosphere are the cornerstone of Impressionism.\n\nBut while Monet painted these very subjects, the paintings belong to the oeuvre of his stepdaughter, and subsequently daughter-in-law, Blanche Hoschedé-Monet (1865–1947). She learned to paint at Monet's shoulder, and exhibited and sold her work through the leading Parisian dealers of the time. Her finest paintings suggest an artist of such flair that you wonder how she has slipped from history's grasp.\n\nAlamy/ Collection of Alice and Rick Johnson Claude Monet's Morning on the Seine near Giverny (1897) and Blanche Hoschedé-Monet's Morning on the Seine (c 1896) (Credit: Alamy/ Collection of Alice and Rick Johnson)\n\nA new exhibition and accompanying monograph – the artist's first – seeks to restore her reputation. Blanche Hoschedé-Monet in the Light at The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana, brings together 40 of her paintings, along with sketchbooks, photographs and letters, establishing not just her impressionist credentials, but her role as Monet's assistant and companion on plein air painting expeditions – the only one of his children, blood-related or otherwise, whose passion for painting mirrored his own.\n\nThe difficulty of extracting Hoschedé-Monet from history has been compounded by the fact that few of her 300-ish works are in public collections. In her native France, the former Musée Municipal de Vernon, near the Normandy village of Giverny, where the Monet family lived for decades, holds the largest number – eight paintings and one pastel – and was valiantly renamed the Musée Blanche Hoschedé-Monet last year to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Impressionism. Meanwhile Paris's Musée d'Orsay (widely regarded as the best collection of Impressionist art) has only a further two – neither of which, at the time of writing, is on display.\n\nWhile Blanche Hoschedé-Monet's work remains relatively unknown, it is clear that she is gaining more recognition with collectors and institutions – Julia Leveille\n\nThere are no Hoschedé-Monet paintings in British public collections at all, and in the US, only one, The Weeping Willows on the Lily Pond at Giverny (c 1893-7) at the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio. The Indiana exhibition is the artist's first solo show on US soil, in fact, and an indication that her reputation is finally growing.\n\n\"While Hoschedé-Monet's work remains relatively unknown and somewhat underappreciated in the marketplace, it is clear that she is gaining more recognition with collectors and institutions,\" says Julia Leveille, head of modern-day auctions at Sotheby's New York.\" Strong prices have been set for her work at auction recently, and we are excited to see where her market goes from here.\"\n\nWhen Blanche came into Claude's life\n\nHoschedé-Monet was the daughter of Eugene Hoschedé, a wealthy businessman and connoisseur of avant-garde painting. Édouard Manet, Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Mary Cassatt and of course Monet were regular guests at his beautiful homes on the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and at his estate at Montgeron, on the city's edge.\n\nHoschedé-Monet was 11 when she first met Claude Monet in 1876. The then-35-year-old had been commissioned by her father to paint a quartet of panels for the dining room at Montgeron. Hoschedé was an important early patron of Monet's – in fact, it was he who bought Impression, Sunrise (1872), the painting that gave Impressionism its name.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Arthur M Wood/ Collection of Alice and Rick Johnson Claude Monet's Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) and Blanche Hoschedé-Monet's The Small Grainstacks (Credit: Art Institute of Chicago, Collection of Alice and Rick Johnson)\n\n\"I remember his arrival. He was introduced to me as a great artist, and he had long hair,\" she recollected in autobiographical notes she wrote towards the end of her life, which her brother Jean-Pierre then used as a basis for a personal and intimate account of Monet's life and family at Giverny. \" That struck me, and I immediately had sympathy for him because we could tell he was fond of children.\"\n\nBlanche's touch is more emphatic than Monet's, out of concern for capturing what she saw on her canvas rather than what she felt – Philippe Piguet\n\nIn her notes, Hoschedé-Monet also singled out Monet's Springtime or The Reader (1872) as the painting she loved most in her father's considerable collection. She was \"deeply struck\", she said, by the touches of sunlight on the skirt of the woman – Monet's first wife, Camille.\n\nThe six months Monet spent at Montgeron in 1876 led to a magnificent set of paintings that includes the much-loved Turkeys and Willows at the River's Edge, though they did not remain in Hoschedé's possession for long. Dire financial pressures forced him to sell most of his collection in 1878, along with both of his homes.\n\nMonet brought Hoschedé, his wife Alice and their six children (Marthe, Blanche, Suzanne, Jacques, Germaine, and Jean-Pierre) to live with him, Camille and their two sons Jean, 11, and newborn Michel, at his home in Vétheuil, northwest of Paris.\n\nCamille's health deteriorated post-partum, however, and in 1879 she died, after which Alice and Monet entered into \"what we believe was a domestic partnership,\" says Haley Pierce, co-curator of Blanche Hoschedé-Monet in the Light. But they didn’t marry until 1892, after Hoschedé had passed away. [Hoschedé] had been estranged from the family for a while at this point.\"\n\nJuvenalia aside, the earliest works in the show date from 1882, when the newly-merged family rented a house in the seaside resort of Pourville, near Dieppe. Monet's painting Cliff Walk at Pourville features the then-17-year-old Hoschedé-Monet with her elder sister, Marthe, and Hoschedé-Monet filled a sketchbook with her own sunlit views.\n\nClark Art Institute/ Alamy Claude Monet's Spring in Giverny (1890) and Blanche Hoschedé-Monet's Shadows on the Meadow (Credit: Clark Art Institute/ Alamy)\n\nIn spring 1883, Monet moved the family to Giverny, where Hoschedé-Monet began to paint in earnest. Delighted by her enthusiasm, he began taking her with him on his outdoor painting expeditions. According to the biography of Hoschedé-Monet's which her brother Jean-Pierre also wrote, \"she helped him in all circumstances… transporting his canvases and easel as well as her own. She did it all with the help of a wheelbarrow, following elusive paths, across fields and meadows sometimes drenched in dew. That was the case, for example, with his morning views of the Seine. Here again, she would help her stepfather by taking up the oars of the canoe.\"\n\nMonet also suggested exhibitions she might enjoy. In 1891, for instance, he asked his friend Gustave Geffroy, an influential critic, to obtain a pass for her to the Salon of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and later that year, took her with him to dine at the home of the British artist James McNeill Whistler in London (they were visiting her brother Jacques in Lymington) and to see the famous Peacock Room that Whistler created for shipping magnate Frederick Leyland's mansion near Hyde Park.\n\nHow the two Monets compare\n\nMonet's 1887 painting In the Woods at Giverny: Blanche Hoschedé at Her Easel with Suzanne Hoschedé Reading, confirms that he and Hoschedé set up their easels within spitting distance of each other, or even, if she is the figure in the white dress at an easel in John Singer Sargent's oil sketch, Monet in his Bateau Atelier (also 1887), squashed together in the floating studio which Monet designed to paint while drifting along the river.\n\nUnsurprisingly, then, Hoschedé-Monet's paintings often share her mentor's visual vocabulary: Shadows on the Meadow (Giverny, the Ajoux plain) matches his Spring Landscape at Giverny (1894) for instance, and The Small Grainstacks (Les Moyettes) (c 1894) his Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (1890-91). Julie Manet, daughter of the impressionist Berthe Morisot and Manet's brother Eugène, would also describe two of Blanche's paintings of \"trees reflected in the Epte [that] are very like Monsieur Monet's painting\" while visiting Giverny in 1893.\n\nAs Hoschedé-Monet's great-nephew, the art historian Philippe Piguet, further explains, \"her touch is more emphatic, out of concern for capturing what she saw on her canvas rather than what she felt\" – meaning that Hoschedé-Monet's paintings can be described as more solid or direct in their rendering and composition, and less atmospheric, as compared to Monet. She also preferred to paint a subject from varying viewpoints, he adds, rather than, as Monet did, at different times of day.\n\nConsider her painting Haystack at Giverny alongside the Monet Haystacks at Giverny (1893) that was sold at Sotheby's last year. \"They're at the same or approximate location, but she has distinctly chosen a different view,\" says Pierce. \"Her painting is also more solid. She has less interest in the quality of atmosphere, and more in really getting down her subject. Her compositions are very well thought out.\"\n\nCollection of Philippe Piguet-Claude Monet The photo from July 1915 captures Claude Monet working at a painting, with Blanche by his side (Credit: Collection of Philippe Piguet-Claude Monet)\n\nBy now, Hoschedé-Monet was blooming. The previous year, the US artist Theodore Robinson noted in his diary: \"I saw some things by Mlle Blanche, she has improved greatly since I saw her work last – a spring landscape, sold to [the Chicago millionaire] Potter Palmer quite charming.\" Her rapid progress excited Monet, too: away in Norway in 1895, he wrote to Alice, \"I can't wait to see what she has done in my absence, especially from what you tell me\".\n\nIn 1897, Hoschedé-Monet married Jean and they moved to Rouen, but returned to Giverny at weekends. For a time, her upward trajectory continued – in 1905, she began exhibiting with the Salon des Indépendants in Paris, and in 1907 the Salon de la Société des Artistes Rouennais – but when Jean had a serious fall in 1912, she gave up painting to care for him.\n\nWe might see Blanche as the comet's tail of Impressionism, though perhaps her greatest contribution to it was her steadfast support\n\nWhen Jean died two years later, Hoschedé-Monet returned to live at Giverny, where the recently widowed Monet was panic-stricken that he was losing his sight and finding it difficult to work. Her decision delighted his friends. Geffroy told her he was \"happy for him and happy for you. Your mutual misfortune makes your reunion stronger.\"\n\nHer reassuring presence gave Monet the strength he required to begin the monumental compositions of water lilies that occupied his final years and which he hoped would create \"the illusion of an endless whole\". The exhibition includes a photograph of him working on these \"Grand Decorations\", as he called them, with Hoschedé Monet at his side.\n\nMonet's close friend, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, later wrote that she had prepared the canvas grounds, but Hoschedé-Monet refuted the claim. \"Contrary to what has been said and what has been written, I didn't make a brushstroke on [Monet's] canvases. It would have been a sacrilege.\" She also described Monet's death in 1926: \"It was the soul of the house who left… Everything here was illuminated by him.\"\n\nWith Michel's approval, Hoschedé-Monet remained at Giverny for the rest of her life, caring for the house and studio, and tending to Monet's beloved gardens. She resumed painting again almost immediately, and in 1927 had her first solo exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Critics took great interest in her renaissance, with one from newspaper Le Peuple proclaiming her \"more than the heiress of a great name\".\n\nLA County Museum of Art/ Mr and Mrs George Gard De Sylva Collection/ Museum Associates/ LACMA In this 1887 painting, Monet depicts Blanche at her easel (Credit: LA County Museum of Art/ Mr and Mrs George Gard De Sylva Collection/ Museum Associates/ LACMA)\n\nImpressionism lost its grip on the art world almost as soon as Monet died, but Hoschedé-Monet always remained loyal to her mentor's painting style. We might see her as the comet's tail of that hugely influential artistic movement, though perhaps her greatest contribution to it was her steadfast support. \"Without her, Claude Monet would have lived in an isolation that would have killed him,\" wrote the art dealer René Gimpel. \"It was she who kept him alive for us, posterity must not forget her.\"\n\nBlanche Hoschedé-Monet in the Light is at the The Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Museum of Art, Indiana until 15 June.\n\n--",

Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\n\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimed film productions and influential names drawing attention to its unique culture.\n\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, from fashion to sports to entertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's series The White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink's Lisa Manobal, Patravadi Mejudhon, Tayme Thapthimthong and actor, model and businessman Dom Hetrakul join the star-studded cast.\n\nThe SpeciaList (Credit: Wardrobe Ministry) Bangkok-born Dom Hetrakul has built a portfolio as an actor, model and TV presenter while juggling his job as a motorcycle trading businessman. He has starred in several local and international productions, including Bangkok Dangerous (2008), Twilight Over Burma (2015) and The Family (2023). Hetrakul's most recent screen venture is HBO's The White Lotus season three, where he plays a Thai hotel spa attendant.\n\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\n\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\n\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui.\n\nAlamy Koh Samui's wellness scene attracts yogis from all around the world (Credit: Alamy)\n\n1. Best for wellness: Koh Samui\n\nHome to the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui where much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed, Koh Samui is perhaps the ultimate White Lotus set-jetting destination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\n\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\n\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\n\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\n\nGetty Images On an island teeming with culinary delights, Hetrakul highlights Jun Hom, a beachside spot known for its home cooking and fresh seafood (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n2. Best culinary experience: Jun Hom, Koh Samui\n\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night – daytime, office hours – we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\n\nTip: If you wish to experience one of Thailand's more emblematic celebrations, consider visiting during Songkran (Thai New Year). The festivities run between 13-15 April 2025 and celebrate the end of summer, welcoming the rainy season with water-pouring traditions. \"The Songkran Festival is chaotic in the best sense, to be honest,\" says Hetrakul. \"It's not really the traditional, soft [kind of experience]; it's [high power] stuff.\"\n\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likes Summer by Coco Tam, The Shack and Gusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt, Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish and yum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui – and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns – you name it – Jun Hom makes [it].\"\n\nWebsite: https://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui Address: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330 Phone: +66 77 602 008\n\nGetty Images Thailand, especially Ko Pha Ngan and Bangkok, is known for its high-voltage nightlife (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n3. Best for parties: Ko Pha Ngan\n\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in the trailer.\n\nTip: Nightlife is at the core of the Thai travelling experience. \"You'll see the nightlife in the White Lotus season three,\" says Hetrakul. \"For some [previous portrayals onscreen] you might have seen The Hangover II or The Beach – that's how crazy we go. It depends on how you [pick] the places. You have premium clubs at hotels, but also very affordable places.\" If you're in Bangkok, he recommends checking out the options [on] Sukhumvit Road, one of the world's longest roads, which runs from Thailand to Cambodia.\n\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot is Ko Pha Ngan island, about 38km from Koh Samui – eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for the Full Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\n\nFor those wary of big crowds – the parties attract thousands of attendants – Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\n\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\n\nAlamy Just 30km north-west of Koh Samui, Mu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park is a wildlife lover's paradise (Credit: Alamy)\n\n4.

The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\n\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available on Ko Wua Talap, the park's largest island, Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\n\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\n\nGetty Images Phuket is Thailand's largest island, and a haven for eco-tourism (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n5. Best for eco-tourism: Baan Tha Chatchai, Phuket\n\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommended Ta Khai restaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to the Anantara Mai Khao Phuket resort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\n\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach – Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest called Baan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\n\nLocal dishes such as mee hokkien (chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional – truly local – food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\n\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\n\nAlamy Visit Rajadamnern Muay Thai Stadium to take in Thailand's famous boxing (Credit: Alamy)\n\n6. Best sports experience: Rajadamnern Muay Thai Stadium, Bangkok\n\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titled Grand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\n\nAs a sports enthusiast – he practices Muay Thai – Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan of UFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\n\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand – \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says – the actor recommends stopping by the Rajadamnern Stadium in his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring – the only one of its kind in the world.\n\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\n\nWebsite: https://rajadamnern.com/ Address: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100 Instagram: @rajadamnern_stadium\n\nGetty Images The Buddhist temple Wat Pho is credited as the birthplace of Thai massage (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n7. Best cultural experience: Nuad Thai at Wat Pho, Bangkok\n\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 on Unesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\n\nThe Buddhist temple Wat Pho, credited as the birthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\n\nAs home to the Watpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\n\nWebsite: https://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about Address: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\n\n*This article, originally published on 26 February 2025, provides a companion to fans tuning into the Season 3 finale on 6 April.\n\nBBC Travel's The SpeciaList is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

To assess this, doctors use the sit-to-stand test (STS), which measures how many times you can rise to a standing position from seated within 30 seconds. It's commonly performed in GP surgeries, or community settings when screening for health issues amongst older people, but it can also easily be performed at home.\n\n\"It's a really helpful test, because it tells us so much about how well people are functioning,\" says Jugdeep Dhesi, a consultant geriatrician at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London and professor of geriatric medicine at Kings College London, in the UK. \"It tells us about their strength, their balance and their flexibility. We know that there's some studies that suggest that it can help to inform whether people are at risk of things like falls, cardiovascular issues or even at a higher risk of dying.\"\n\nAll you need to do the test at home is a chair with a straight back and no arm rests, and a stopwatch or timer (most modern phones have this function).\n\nTo do the test, simply sit in the middle of the chair, cross your arms and place both of your hands on opposing shoulders. Keep your back straight with your feet on the floor. Then press your stopwatch's start button and rise to a full standing position before sitting down again. Repeat this for 30 seconds, counting how many times you can come to a full standing position.\n\nGetty Images A low score on the sit-to-stand test can be used to identify people who might be at risk of worse health outcomes, like falls or complications after surgery (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhile the test is primarily used in older adults over the age of 60, it has also been used in those who are younger.\n\nThe US public health agency the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has outlined the average results for different age groups. Scores which are below the average could indicate a risk for poor health outcomes, such as falls. For example, for a person aged between 60-64, the average is 14 for a man, and 12 for a woman. If you are aged 85-89, however, the average score is eight. However, these average scores do not take into account a person's medical history – for example if they have recently undergone surgery or have an injury.\n\nThe test can also be beneficial for younger people or those with no health conditions, as it is a good measure of fitness, particularly lower body muscular strength and endurance. Researchers in Switzerland asked almost 7,000 adults to do the STS test and then compared the results. They found that the average score for 20–24-year-olds was 50/minute for men and 47/minute for women. Some of those taking part, however, were able to perform as many as 72 repetitions in a minute.\n\nIn another study of healthy volunteers, who had an average age of 21, researchers found a strong association between the results of the sit-to-stand test and a different – but more time-consuming – measure of their aerobic capacity and endurance.\n\nResearch shows that how well you perform on the test can also tell healthcare providers a great deal about your underlying health. For example a low score on the test can be used to identify people who might be at risk of worse outcomes after surgery or after cancer treatment.\n\nA poor score on the test also suggests that a person's heart and lungs may not be functioning well, putting them at higher risk of \"adverse cardiac events\" such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke and heart failure.\n\nAccording to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), if a person scores less on the test than the \"average\" for their age group then they are also at greater risk of falls.\n\n\"What we're really worried about is that if people don't maintain their strength, their balance, their flexibility and their cardiovascular health, then they're more likely to fall,\" says Dhesi.\n\nAbout 30% of people aged over 65 have a fall every year, and that rises to about 50% in people aged over 80 years. Once people have had one fall, they often become scared of falling again, making them less likely to go out, sometimes leading to social isolation.\n\n\"If you're worried about falling, you're not [necessarily] going to go out and meet people and do other things. So it becomes a bit of a vicious circle,\" says Dhesi.\n\nGetty Images If you are aged 85-89, the average score on the sit-to-stand test is eight (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAs well as social isolation, falls can cause significant injuries, especially in older people. \"Falls are a really big issue, because as well as minor injuries, muscle tears and sprains, there is a risk of significant injuries like hip fractures,\" says Dhesi. In the US more than 300,000 people each year suffer hip fractures. \"We know that there are 70,000 hip fractures a year in the UK and around 30% of people will die within a year of a hip fracture,\" says Dhesi.\n\nOne 2012 study even found that a variation of the STS test was a \"significant predictor of mortality\" of adults aged between 51 to 80. Individuals who scored low on the test were between five to six times more likely to die over a six-year period than those who scored highest. However, Dhesi points out that while tests like STS are a good indicator of health, they cannot predict how long a person can live.\n\n\"What you can use them [the sit-to-stand test results] to say is – this is something we need to think about, and there are treatments or interventions that we should be doing to try to improve a person's health outcomes, their quality of life, their independence and to help them to live well for longer, which is the really key bit,\" says Dhesi.\n\n\"Doing these kinds of tests at home helps you to see where you are in relation to other people of your age and so it can be a really useful prompt to remind you to do all the things that you can do to get better and stay better. So, I think it's a really good way of empowering people to take control of their own health.\"\n\nGetty Images Activities such as gardening are recommended for improving your general strength and fitness – and consequently your sit-to-stand score (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nHow to improve your performance\n\nAccording to Dhesi, the best way of improving your score is to stay as active and mobile as possible. If mobility is difficult, you can start by doing seated exercises that can be used to build up strength. From there, you could move to standing up perhaps five times every hour or two hours.\n\nIf you are able, simply walking up and down your living room and making sure that you are going up and down the stairs at least three or four times a day can also make a difference.\n\n\"You want to avoid 'bungalow legs' [i.e. weak legs from living in a single-storey home] – essentially you want to make sure you can carry on going up and down stairs using those muscles, maintaining your balance, and remaining independent,\" says Dhesi.\n\nDhesi also advises people to go out and join exercise classes if they can. Many gyms run exercise programs for seniors at low cost.\n\n\"The added benefit there is the social contact on top of the physical contact. And we know that that's a really important aspect of as you get older – loneliness and social isolation can really be detrimental for your health.\"\n\nFinally, other tips include keeping moving and doing housework. For older adults, playing with your grandkids if you have them – getting down on the floor with them, and getting up off the floor with them – can be helpful. Other recommendations include adding simple activities to your day-to-day routine such as getting up and stretching if you've been sat down for a while, walking to the shops instead of driving, or doing more gardening.\n\n--\n\nFor trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.",

    "content": "What's the lowest carbon alcohol?\n\n13 December 2024 Share Save Jocelyn Timperley @jloistf Share Save\n\nGetty Images I decided to investigate whether I can enjoy alcohol in a more sustainable way (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAre beer, wine or spirits better for the climate? And how does alcohol overall compare to other drinks and foods? Jocelyn Timperley takes a look into her drinking habits to find the most environmentally friendly tipple.\n\nA few years ago, I discovered that the glass in some wine bottles can weigh as much as the wine inside, effectively doubling the transport emissions of the wine.\n\nI decided to try a switch to boxed wine and, living in France at the time, found some decent ones. But I also found that a constantly open box in the fridge made me drink more, and after moving back to the UK where good boxed wine seemed harder to come by, I dropped the experiment.\n\nWhile I've taken steps to reduce my personal carbon footprint from things like food and transport, the environmental footprint of alcohol consumption has largely remained off my radar. In fact, alcohol often seems to be given rather a silent free pass when it comes to discussions on sustainable food choices. So I decided to investigate in more detail how much alcohol is actually contributing to my carbon emissions – and whether I can enjoy it in a more sustainable way.\n\nA Swedish study found alcohol consumption generated an average of 52kg of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per person per year, equivalent to around four steaks or 70 glasses of milk\n\nMy first port of call was Megan Cook, a research fellow at the Centre for Alcohol Policy Research (CAPR) at La Trobe University in Australia, who recently co-published a call for more research on the contribution of alcohol to climate change and other environmental problems.\n\nCook says the evidence around the environmental impacts of alcohol is \"underdeveloped\". \"There is both a lack of evidence and little consensus on how to measure the environmental impact of alcohol,\" she says. \"Currently estimates can vary quite widely depending on which factors are considered and how estimates are calculated.\" These estimates do show, however, that alcohol \"does have a substantial impact\" in terms of emissions, says Cook.\n\nA 2021 study in the UK, for example, found that drinks, predominantly tea, coffee and alcohol, contribute around 15% of the greenhouse gas emissions from diets, while a 2018 Swedish study concluded alcohol specifically contributed 3%.\n\nSome researchers have suggested a reduction of \"luxury\" low-nutrition crops used to make alcoholic drinks, such as vineyards, as a way to make diets more sustainable and free up land, although others have noted that this would be a \"controversial cultural topic\".\n\nThe carbon footprint of alcohol can vary hugely depending on what is being looked at, how far it has travelled, and the method used for evaluating it. A 2022 review of studies about wine, for example, found carbon footprints ranging from 0.15 to 3.51kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per bottle.\n\nEven when comparing the same lifecycle stages, \"we found carbon footprints with differences as high as around six times between different wines,\" says Luís Pinto da Silva, assistant professor in geosciences at the University of Porto in Portugal and co-author of the study.\n\nGetty Images Wine has around three times the carbon footprint of beer per litre – but adjusted for portion sizes, the emissions are similar (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nA key question I wanted to know was whether there was any clear-cut difference in carbon between different types of alcohol. In the 2018 Swedish study, researcher Elinor Eva Mari Hallström from the Research Institute of Sweden (Rise) and her colleagues looked at exactly this.\n\nUsing self-reported data from 50,000 people in Sweden, a country with similar overall alcohol consumption to the US, they calculated the lifecycle climate impact of beer, wine and spirits. (Beer is the most widely drunk alcohol in the US: it makes up 49% of alcohol consumption, compared to 18% for wine and 34% spirits.)\n\nThe study found that beer has around a third of the carbon footprint of wine and spirits per litre. Adjusted for portion sizes, though, beer and wine come in as roughly equal: a standard 12oz (350ml) 3.5% beer would have a footprint of around 0.28kg CO2e, while a 5oz (150ml) glass of wine would be 0.32kg CO2e. A 1.5oz (40ml) portion of a spirit, meanwhile, would emit on average just 0.09kg CO2e, far lower than either beer or wine.\n\nFor a Christmas dinner you would save far more emissions by swapping out a steak for a lovely mushroom wellington and having an extra glass of wine – Kimberly Nicholas\n\nAnother analysis looking at a wider range of drinks found that cider has around double the carbon footprint of beer, while sparkling wine and champagne have the same emissions as wine, and brandy/cognac has substantially higher emissions than vodka, sherry and coffee cream liqueur.\n\nOverall, the Swedish study found, alcohol consumption generated an average of 52kg of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per person per year, equivalent to around four steaks or 70 glasses of milk. But for the 10% of people with the highest intake of alcohol, yearly emissions reached four times this amount, and overall alcohol intake among men generated 90% more emissions than among women.\n\nKimberly Nicholas, a senior lecturer at the Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies in Sweden, says it's important to put findings like this in perspective within overall emissions.\n\nIn Sweden, Nicholas notes, meat consumption per person leads to around a tonne of CO2e per year – some 20 times more than drinking alcohol. \"That means that for a Christmas dinner you would save far more emissions by swapping out a steak for a lovely mushroom wellington, for example, and having an extra glass of wine,\" she says.\n\nAnd for high emitters in industrialised countries, the majority of emissions come from flying and driving, Nicholas adds. \"Food [and drink] is also an important area but it's much smaller than those other two,\" she says.\n\nJoseph Poore, director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Food Sustainability at the University of Oxford in the UK, says there are a lot of interesting sustainable businesses out there trying to do good things. \"I think it's actually just a case of looking out for sustainable businesses and trying to support them,\" he says.\n\nGetty Images Some beer companies are experimenting with ways to reduce their carbon impacts (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nSome spirit companies are also turning waste streams, such as old bread, croissants and pastries, into vodka.\n\nWhile Poore is doubtful of the claims from some companies, he says others have decent life cycle assessments behind them. Still, sustainability claims, he adds, are \"not well regulated at the moment\".\n\nPinto da Silva says companies should be quantifying and disclosing the environmental impacts of their products. In fact, a detailed public emissions inventory is one good way to discern whether a company is really serious about cutting carbon.\n\nThe easiest and most obvious way to reduce carbon emissions from alcohol is simply to drink less of it\n\nStill, unlike the clear cut advice given in other areas of food (such as to avoid certain types of meat or fish), there are fewer clear cut rules about how to consume alcohol sustainably, Poore tells me.\n\nPoore's one piece of advice would be to consider buying organic wine, due to the high quantities of pesticides involved in conventional wine. The largest carbon impacts come from viticulture (growing the grapes) and bottling, with transport and the wine production contributing to a lesser extent.\n\nEmissions from growing grapes come from the diesel used in agricultural machinery and, to a lower extent, the use of fertilisers, says Pinto da Silva. But viticulture can also contribute to carbon removals, he adds. \"Healthy vineyard soils can absorb and store atmospheric CO2. If nearby vegetation is integrated and maintained in the vineyard, they can absorb and store CO2 as part of their biomass.\"\n\nSuch carbon removal processes can be \"enhanced by good agro-environmental practices,\" Pinto da Silva adds, helping to mitigate the carbon impact of wine production.\n\nOrganic and regenerative agricultural practices to increase soil health, such as minimising tillage, eliminating synthetic fertilisers and introducing more biodiversity, have long been used in some vineyards despite the wider industrialisation of farming. But they are now gaining increasing prominence as a way to mitigate and adapt to the impact of climate change.\n\nStill, it's actually the bottles that several studies find to be the main contributor to the carbon footprint of wine, says Pinto da Silva.\n\nUnlike most foods, says Nicholas, research shows that packaging actually makes up a substantial portion of the emissions from alcohol. This is especially the case for spirits and wine, where producing the packaging alone accounts for around a third of the carbon footprint.\n\nGetty Images Viticulture makes up a large proportion of the carbon impact of wine – but good practices can also lead to some CO2 being absorbed by the soil (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Systembolaget, a government-owned chain of liquor stores in Sweden, boxes and bags are the most climate-friendly way to package alcohol, followed by cartons, returnable glass and cans. Glass comes in as by far the most carbon intensive, a finding backed up by other research.\n\nManufacturing glass is carbon intensive, and glass's heaviness also contributes strongly to food miles. \"Basically it takes a lot of energy to melt sand into glass, and a lot of energy comes from fossil fuels right now; glass is heavy and it takes energy to ship it around,\" says Nicholas.\n\nAs producers attempt to cut their carbon footprints, some are moving towards lighter wine bottles, which can weigh as little as 330g (12oz). Some package-free shops are also experimenting with reusable wine bottles: one wine shop I used to go to in London would always have an excellent box of red, white and rose which you could fill up reusable bottles with for £10 ($12.75).\n\nBeing made of plastic and cardboard, wine boxes are far lighter than glass, and their mechanisms are great for avoiding the wine being exposed to oxygen as it is in an open bottle, meaning the wine stays fresh for three or four weeks after opening.\n\nOf course, there are disadvantages too: it tends to come in boxes of 3-5 litres, equivalent to four to seven bottles of wine: a lot of wine to get through in just a few weeks. It also has a shorter shelf life than bottled wine so is only suitable for wine you'll be drinking soon-ish, not for ageing. Plastic is also far less recyclable than endlessly recyclable glass, says Poore, which can also in theory be returned for reuse. In order to reap the benefits of recyclable or reusable packaging, though, we have to actually recycle or reuse them, and this isn't always happening, says Cook. In the US, for example, the rate of glass recycling was only 31% in 2018.\n\nDuring my quest for lower carbon alcohol, I bought a box of wine to mull for a Christmas party, and I plan to experiment more to see if I can find some boxed wines I like.\n\nBut it's clear that there is a dearth of good information out there on how to cut the carbon impact of alcohol as a consumer. \"It's not just on individuals here – we need global intragovernmental coordination to address climate change, and to hold the alcohol industry to account for their climate impacts,\" says Cook.\n\nResearch has shown that the glasses we use to drink wine have been gradually increasing in size, and that this could be influencing how much we drink. In the UK, researchers recently called on the government to stop serving beer in pint (0.6 litre) glasses after a study showed they led people to drink more compared to smaller glass sizes.\n\nMy biggest takeaways are to concentrate on drinking smaller amounts of better quality alcoholic drinks, and particularly to seek out producers using regenerative agricultural practices (such as a focus on biodiversity), renewable energy and sustainable packaging. As Poore puts it, \"consume less and better\".\n\nStill, a point from Nicholas sticks in my head: for the same climate impact as a round-trip flight between New York and London, she calculates, you could drink some 1,250 bottles of wine. \"So [you could] potentially have many lovely evenings around the dinner table enjoying a nice wine instead of a weekend in New York or London.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

There's a huge array of reusable options, from pads to pants to menstrual cups. Ana Santi explores which is the most sustainable and how safe they are.\n\nDuring a weekend away with my girlfriends a few years ago, one of them mentioned that she was wearing period pants, an environmental decision to move away from single-use pads and tampons. I'd vaguely heard of them, but didn't know anyone who wore them and I'd always been a little sceptical – would they be absorbent enough? My friend convinced me otherwise and they've remained my product of choice ever since. But as I browse the shelves of menstrual products in my local supermarket today, I'm overwhelmed by the choice available: so many pads and tampons (some organic, most not), numerous types of cups, a few period pants.\n\nI set out to find the most sustainable period product available.\n\nGiven that 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate every month, a group of academics based in France and the US conducted a life-cycle assessment of menstrual products across four product groups: disposable non-organic and organic pads and tampons (with applicators); reusable pads; period underwear; and menstrual cups, which are made from soft, flexible silicone or rubber and can hold 20-30ml (around two tablespoons) of menstrual blood. Comparing eight environmental impact indicators – global warming potential, fossil resources, land use, water use, carcinogenic effects, ecotoxicity, acidification and eutrophication – and conducted over one year across three countries (France, India and the US), the assessment considers impacts from production to disposal.\n\nAcross all the three countries and environmental impacts, the menstrual cup was a clear winner, followed by period underwear, reusable pads and, in last place, single-use pads and tampons. Small and lightweight, one person's menstrual cup can last up to 10 years.\n\nDisposable pads – both organic and non-organic – had the highest impacts across all eight categories except water use, with non-organic pads scoring the highest for global warming potential and resource depletion. The global warming potential – greenhouse gas emissions' ability to absorb heat and warm the atmosphere over a given time period – came from manufacturing, with almost half of the impact from production of polyethylene (a petroleum-based plastic). But one of the most surprising results – not least to the report's authors – was that organic cotton pads had the highest impact of all, across five categories.\n\n\"The impacts are mostly linked to raw material manufacturing and organic production, which can have higher environmental impacts,\" explains Mélanie Douziech, one of the study's co-authors from Mines Paris-PSL university. The yield of organic farming is lower than conventional farming, meaning more water and land is needed to produce the same amount of organic as conventional cotton. Similar results were found for organic and non-organic cotton tampons.\n\nGetty Images In the US, 20 billion disposable period products are discarded each year (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nDepending on the product, different parts of the lifecycle influence the emissions. \"For disposable products, it's the raw material production and manufacturing, as a lot of these products have plastics in them, which have quite a large global warming impact,\" says Douziech. \"With reusable products, it is the manufacturing and use phases, especially the electricity requirements.\"\n\nWater and electricity are needed to wash all reusable products between wear, but period pants perform better than reusable pads, in part because otherwise another form of underwear would be worn – and washed – regardless. \"Even though the menstrual cup is a clear winner, period underwear is also an alternative product that really reduces the environmental impacts,\" says Douziech. How we care for them can also affect the overall impact, such as washing at lower temperatures and as part of a full load.\n\nThe assessment did not consider plastic pollution, but according to the study each conventional pad, including wrappers, wings and adhesives, adds some 2g of non-biodegradable plastic – the equivalent of four plastic bags – to the environment and take an estimated 500 to 800 years to decompose. The study adds that, in the US, 80% of conventional tampons and 20% of conventional pads are flushed down toilets, blocking sewers and releasing microplastics into oceans.\n\nPrior to this report, an analysis of several life-cycle analyses comparing the environmental impacts of menstrual products, including emissions and resource depletion, was commissioned by the UN Environment Programme in 2021. Co-author Philippa Notten, director of the Cape Town-based non-profit TGH Think Space, which focuses on energy, climate change and sustainability projects, says that, due to a lack of data, the impact of plastic at menstrual products' end of life is not well documented in life-cycle assessments. \"Plastic tends to get modelled as if it ends up in a landfill or incinerator. Counterintuitively, landfill actually looks good from a carbon footprint point of view because plastic takes hundreds of years to degrade, so those carbon emissions are locked up in the landfill, which acts like a carbon sink,\" she says. \"In reality, the product doesn't always end up in a formal waste management stream; it ends up as litter on beaches, as microplastics in the sea. And there is still a lot of carbon in the production of plastics.\"\n\nIn UNEP's report, the menstrual cup also comes out on top by a considerable margin. \"It's quite rare for this to happen to a product,\" Notten says. \"It's not that the cup doesn't have a carbon footprint, but because it's such a small, light product, the impact is also small relative to other products.\"\n\n\"We always talk about 'break even points' in these studies: how many times do you have to use a renewable product before it has made up for the emissions caused in its manufacturing and use phases, compared to a single-use product?\" Notten says. \"For many products, it's often really high, like 100 times. With a menstrual cup, you only have to use it for a month before it breaks even on its carbon footprint.\"\n\nBoth studies express the importance of context and highlight that greenhouse gas emissions are only one of the many consequences of products and processes. \"No matter what we do, we are going to have an impact, but the idea is to minimise this impact as much as possible,\" says Paula Pérez-López, co-author of the France and US study and a researcher at Mines Paris-PSL university.\n\nThe life-cycle assessment recommends that women consider factors beyond environmental impact, including social and cultural attitudes and infrastructures. \"This was out of our field of environmental assessment expertise, but in some African countries, reusable products, in particular menstrual cups, could be the difference between going to school and not for some girls, who don't have access to a period product,\" says Pérez-López. \"Of course, the problem of access extends to all kinds of products, but a menstrual cup could be much easier to access because it's a small product that lasts a long time.\"\n\nGetty Images The menstrual cup was ranked the most environmentally-friendly product in a life-cycle assessment (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nBut recent reports have warned of the consequences of a poorly fitted, incorrectly sized menstrual cup, with one woman developing temporary kidney problems and some women suffering from pelvic organ prolapse. Shazia Malik, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Portland Hospital in London, is reluctant to recommend menstrual cups to teenagers unless they are carefully taught how to use and care for them. \"In the last eight years, I've seen patients – women and teenagers – who use menstrual cups develop infections,\" she says. \"If you don't insert [the cup] properly, it can compress the bladder or rectum, and it won't effectively collect menstrual blood.\"\n\nMalik also warns of the dangers of using the same menstrual cup for many years. Her advice is to have two cups on the go, sterilise them after each use – including every morning and night – and to replace them as soon as there is any wear and tear. \"We also need more awareness on choosing the right menstrual cup size, depending on your flow and whether you've had a vaginal birth. With education, the menstrual cup is a fantastic period product,\" Malik says.\n\nWith a menstrual cup, you only have to use it for a month before it breaks even on its carbon footprint – Philippa Notten\n\nIn the UK, the Women's Environmental Network, a non-profit, is calling for a Menstrual Health, Dignity and Sustainability Act to combat period poverty, environmental waste and toxic chemicals found in period products. WEN cites a new policy in the Spanish region of Catalonia as an example to follow. From March 2024 all women in Catalonia were given access to free, reusable menstrual products.\n\nAmong the network's concerns is a US study that detected 16 types of metals, including lead, in tampons, and a report by Which?, a UK consumer magazine, which found \"unnecessarily high levels of silver\" in some period pants, used as an antimicrobial agent to combat concerns about smell and hygiene.\n\nHelen Lynn, a campaign manager focusing on the environmental impacts of menstrual products at WEN, says that such chemicals are harmful to human health and the environment, with innovation happening faster than regulation. \"[The life-cycle assessment] is an interesting study but it doesn't take into account chemical residues and additives in menstrual products because businesses aren't obliged to disclose them, so studies like these can only look at the main materials disclosed by manufacturers,\" she says. \"A lack of transparency means that people don't know what's in these products and they put them next to a very absorbent part of the body.\"\n\nGetty Images The water and electricity needed to wash reusable period products also needs to be taken into consideration (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn 2024, Vermont became the first US state to adopt a new law to ban the \"forever chemicals\" PFAs in menstrual products, while a bill led by New York congresswoman Grace Meng calls for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study the make-up of menstrual products.\n\nMarina Gerner, professor at New York University's Stern School of Business and author of The Vagina Business, would welcome a US equivalent to the EU Ecolabel, but is calling for a global initiative. \"Companies need to disclose the ingredients of their period products and toxic ingredients need to be banned by regulators,\" Gerner says. \"The reason this hasn't happened yet is because women's health has historically been under researched and underfunded. The modern tampon was invented in 1931 and the first study on metal levels in tampons was only published last year.\"\n\nSeveral years ago, I switched to mostly using period pants. They last between two to three years and cost about £45 ($56.7) for three pairs. At approximately £2.75 ($3.48) for a pack of 10 pads, and using two packs per month, I would have spent up to £200 ($252.7) on pads in the same period. A menstrual cup is approximately £20 ($25.2) and, for people comfortable using tampons, it is relatively easy to insert, but removal, cleansing and re-insertion when away from home or in public toilets can make it less accessible.\n\nAs a regular swimmer, I plan to try period swimwear next, although the possibility of leakage makes me anxious (I've been assured by people who wear them that this doesn't happen). Even though the life-cycle assessment ranked disposable organic products as the worst environmental offender, on occasions when period pants aren't convenient, I use a disposable, organic cotton, plastic-free and compostable brand that you can discard in your food bin (it is readily available in supermarkets and health stores). Pérez-López says that the study did not model composting at end-of-life. \"This would need to be investigated further.\"\n\nWhen trying to make better environmental choices, it is rare to find a relative silver bullet, like the menstrual cup. But I think that most people who are in a position to choose their menstrual products would prefer a range of options. \"And that is a great solution,\" says Pérez-López. \"Choose a reusable product when you can, but if you're uncomfortable using a certain type of product for your whole cycle, or you can't rely on a reusable product for a particular reason, combine several products. You will still be making a difference.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

    "content": "The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\n24 March 2025 Share Save Rebecca Treon Share Save\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy\n\nIt's a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\n\nIn 2007, I was a recent newcomer to Houston, a humid Texas city on the Gulf of Mexico that felt as foreign to me as if I had moved around the globe. Unsurprisingly, this incredibly diverse city was teeming with international culinary influences. There was Mexican food from across the border; fresh Vietnamese flavours brought by refugees in the 1970s; and New Orleans-style food from people who moved here after Hurricane Katrina. Middle Eastern food was everywhere too, from vast emporiums stocked with brined olives, tabbouleh and vats of hummus to street vendors serving freshly made kebabs. But Houston's most distinctive sandwich was something entirely different: a mashup of an Italian-style hoagie and a Southern po' boy, with a distinctly delicious Middle Eastern twist.\n\nA take on the popular New Orleans-style sandwich, its Texan cousin, the Houston po' boy is layered with sliced ham, salami, provolone cheese, mayo and spicy dill pickle slices, before being slathered in chow chow, a Southern relish made of cabbage, green tomatoes and hot peppers. But what sets the sandwich apart is its creator: Jalal Antone, the Louisiana-born, Texas-raised son of Lebanese and Syrian immigrants. His version of a chow chow recipe had a bold Middle Eastern influence, swapping out traditional mustard and celery seeds for paprika and turmeric, giving the relish a striking orange hue and a deeper, spiced complexity.\n\nAntone dreamed of starting a Middle Eastern import store but was unsure of how it would be received by Houstonians at the time. In 1962, he finally opened Antone's Import Company on Taft Street, selling imported spices, olives, hummus, falafel and tabouli. At the time, most of Houston's half a million residents were unfamiliar with Middle Eastern food. To win them over, he devised a simple but effective solution: a sandwich.\n\n\"Houstonians were eating burgers in those days,\" explains Craig Lieberman, CEO of Antone's. \"The story is that he asked his friends 'How do I sell a product to Houstonians?' They said, 'Come up with a chow chow recipe and put that on your sandwich'.\"\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Jalal Antone came up with a twist on a classic sandwich to encourage people to come to his Middle Eastern import store (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\nAntone sourced French bread from a local bakery, layered it with his imported meats and cheeses and added his signature spiced chow chow. The result? A sandwich that became a Houston staple.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Antone's had become a wild success, with people flocking there from far and wide. A postcard dating from Antone's early years describes the store as a \"tempting world of foreign foods\" while a 1965 Houston Chronicle article notes that the store was stocked with cheeses, olives, eels and even squid pickled in their own ink. But what kept people coming back were the sandwiches.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nRestaurant critic Alison Cook remembers eating the affordable, filling Antone's Original sandwiches as a student at Rice University in 1966, describing the experience in a 2017 Houston Chronicle article. \"It was founded to cater primarily to the local Syrian and Lebanese community, but the po' boys made it a mecca for Houstonians of all stripes. To my impressionable 19-year-old brain, the rambling Antone's space was an exotic wonderland, chockablock with foodstuffs from the Middle East and beyond, festooned with sausages and crammed with cheeses I'd never heard of. In a city where steakhouses, seafood palaces and Italian American spots ruled the dining scene, Antone's pointed the way to a wider world.\"\n\nSome of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants – Megha McSwain\n\nThrough the 1970s and 80s, the Houston po' boy cemented itself as a local lunchtime staple, on par with tacos and barbecue. Antone's success sent a message to the owners of other local Middle Eastern restaurants that if you sold a Houston po' boy, you could also sell everything from baba ganoush to zaatar, and a new type of sandwich was born. Inspired by Antone's, imitators like Droubi's and Kojak's built empires of their own, each with their own take on the sandwich and a slightly different spin on the signature chow chow.\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Antone’s po’ boys are also sold at the groundbreaking Antone’s nightclub in Austin, which brought the blues to Texas (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\n\"Some of Houston's most iconic restaurants were started by immigrants and kind of took on their own path based on a mix of their family recipes combined with what people in Houston wanted and were familiar with,\" says Houston-based food writer Megha McSwain. \"These were really adventurous flavours for people at the time. The story of how they moved forward by creating something unique is why they've lasted so long.\"\n\nWhere to try Houston's most iconic sandwich\n\nAlthough Antone's original import store is long gone, the Houston po' boy lives on. Antone's Famous Po' Boys still has two locations in Houston – one inside The Galleria, the city's massive megamall, and another in the Heights neighbourhood, where you can grab a sandwich alongside Lebanese tabouli and dolmas.\n\nIf you can't make it to a sandwich shop, Antone's po' boys are sold in grocery stores across Texas, including H-E-B, Randall's, Kroger, and Brookshire Brothers. They're even stocked in hospital cafes and at Texan universities like Baylor and The University of Texas. If you're looking for a taste of Antone's at home, their proprietary chow chow can be bought by the jar at local supermarkets along with their pickles.\n\nAntone's Famous Po' Boy Visitors to Houston can find jars of Antone's chow chow in local supermarkets (Credit: Antone's Famous Po' Boy)\n\nThough Houston's food scene continues to evolve, the po' boy remains a symbol of the city's culinary melting pot – a sandwich born from Middle Eastern ingenuity, shaped by Southern tradition and beloved by generations of Houstonians.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many Texans grew up on Antone's,\" says Lieberman. \"We still use the same bread from Royal Bakery and the same recipes that Jalal created; it's a very nostalgic and beloved Texas brand.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

    "content": "I tested some of the most popular ways of meeting new people. Here's what I found\n\n2 days ago Share Save Molly Gorman Share Save\n\nJavier Hirschfeld\n\nWhich hobbies are best for meeting new people? Molly Gorman tested four of them – and discovered surprising facts about how and why we bond as a species.\n\nWalking into a busy climbing gym in London on a Friday night, I feel an overwhelming sense of dread. Desperately gazing past the staff at the reception desk, my eyes lock onto the sea of chalk-covered hands and limbs swinging between multi-coloured holds – all around five metres (16ft) above crash mats.\n\nI am here as part of an experiment for our ongoing BBC series exploring the science – and art – of friendship. Cultivating friendships is key to our wellbeing, and to living a long life. As we mature and become more agreeable, it can actually get easier to form and maintain friendships. But where do you start?\n\nLondon is a city of nearly nine million people, but like anywhere, it can still be lonely. And without opportunities to mingle, it can be hard to try out and develop different friendship skills and strategies.\n\nFinding a hobby may seem an obvious way to foster social connection – in fact, research suggests that bonding through hobbies is a uniquely human trait. However, given the huge range of potential clubs, classes and activities, which one is actually best for making friends? And is there scientific evidence that some activities have more social potential than others?\n\nTo find out, I tested three new activities, and one existing hobby for comparison, and also explored the evidence-backed benefits they might offer. I chose a range of activities, from sports to art, across different budgets. For full transparency, I decided to mention the cost of each activity – since choosing a hobby can also be a matter of affordability. Here's what I found:\n\n1. Team sports: £7 ($9) per week\n\nIn late 2020, I moved to London from the countryside. Seeking to make friends in my local area as well as shape some kind of exercise routine, I decided to join a recreational netball league, which is perfect for those who may be more interested in the social aspect of a team sport, as opposed to the competitiveness.\n\nI soon found a wonderful team and we have now played together for four years. Every Monday evening, rain or shine, we take to the court, but we also meet up outside of the sport – whether that's for a drink after a match or dinner on the weekend.\n\nIf you are not naturally into ball games, this activity may not feel worth trying out – but research suggests that team sports can have huge benefits for people of all ages and all abilities. Inclusive sports can for example improve the wellbeing of children with disabilities by providing them with the opportunity to \"form friendships, express creativity, develop a self-identity and foster a meaning and purpose in life\".\n\nJavier Hirschfeld Team sports can not only make exercise feel easier, but can also help us to build social relationships (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)\n\nAccording to Arran Davis, an expert on social connection and health at the University of Oxford, in the UK, collaborative activities like team sports can not only make exercise feel easier, but can help us build social relationships.\n\n\"There's a couple of ways that could happen: the first is just doing stuff together. So what psychologists call 'sharing intention',\" he says. This term refers to the phenomenon of connecting over or talking about a common goal or action. As Davis puts it, it's the sense of: \"'I think about what you're thinking about, you think about what I'm thinking about'.\"\n\nShared intention \"makes us feel a bit closer to one another and that can lead us to view one another as good cooperative partners or people that we feel more similar to\", he says. \"And these are the things that build friendships… through coordinating or collaborating, we're able to signal to each other that we're friends,\" he explains.\n\nDavis goes on to explain how endorphins and other natural chemicals released in the body when we do aerobic exercise, for example the feeling of \"runner's high\", can be enhanced when we're working in a team. \"Interestingly, these chemicals are also involved in primate bonding. When primates groom each other, they release endorphins, or when we laugh together, we release endorphins,\" he says. \"So this gives us a positive feeling that we then start to associate with the people around us. It can be a way to build connection through sharing a positive psychological state.\"\n\nA 2023 study compared social bonding between humans, and between other primates. It concluded that there may be something unique about the way we as humans bond through shared experiences, whether it's taking a walk together, dancing together, making music together, playing team sports or even just having a conversation. While positive social bonds are generally important for all primates, our special ability as humans to connect through shared, interactive experiences may help us learn more about each other, and ultimately coordinate and maintain larger social networks than other primates, according to the study.\n\nStudies on bouldering and mental health suggest that the sport may have a positive effect on symptoms of depression\n\nFor adults, team sport participation typically declines in older age, but research suggests it's never too late. One study examined the reasons why a group of adults over the age of 55 engage in team sports and found that community and togetherness were an important motivation, as well as the potential health benefits.\n\nFrom my experience, team sports are fantastic for making friends because not only do you see the same people on a weekly basis, but playing a sport together provides a topic of conversation to discuss and bond over. I have made lifelong friends through netball, and it always brings a burst of joy to my week (even when we lose).\n\nStill, I was curious about whether adding other activities could help me widen my social circle further – and reveal insights into our relationship with ourselves, as well as with others. That's how I ended up in the chalk-dusted bouldering gym...\n\n2. Bouldering: £34 ($40) for a beginners' session\n\nBouldering is a type of climbing where the route is \"short but tricky\" and is performed without a harness or ropes. Studies on bouldering and mental health suggest that the sport may have a positive effect on symptoms of depression, more so than home-based exercise, for example. In one study, 133 patients with depression were assigned bouldering psychotherapy for ten weeks – the results showed that bouldering alleviated their symptoms. (Of course, depression is a complex condition, and if you are worried about your mental health, you should consult your healthcare provider for advice and support.)\n\nAs with team sports, the benefits of climbing and bouldering extend across different ages and abilities. Researchers surveying US Veterans and non-Veterans with disabilities found a range of potential therapeutic benefits to adaptive rock and rope climbing, for example, including community connection, confidence-building, and muscle strengthening.\n\nI certainly found that bouldering had a positive effect on my mind. When I was climbing, my sole focus was concentrated on my next move: where my feet needed to go, how to swing my hips to reach the next hold and ensuring I kept a steady grip. Essentially, it felt like problem-solving combined with a physical challenge.\n\nJavier Hirschfeld Climbing centres have routes of varying difficulty levels, marked by the colour of the holds, so beginners and advanced climbers can boulder together (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)\n\nWhen I was taking a rest and observing groups of climbers in the middle of the mats, both chatting and looking out for fellow climbers on the wall, it also became clear that bouldering is a very social sport – they were offering support, encouragement and guidance to each other. Climbing gyms host a range of routes at varying difficulty levels, marked by colour, meaning that people with different fitness levels can boulder together.\n\nI had booked a beginner's bouldering class, where five of us quickly became united in a camaraderie as an instructor guided us through technique, climbing etiquette and safety. After an hour of learning and testing out the routes to see what we could manage with support from our instructor, we were left to our own devices. Our group largely stuck together but it was easy to chat to other climbers.\n\nThe next day, I woke to achy forearms – but it was a satisfying pain, as was the satisfying feeling of trying something brand new.\n\nUnfortunately, the price tag attached to climbing and bouldering is on the higher side – and some may not be comfortable with the level of risk and potential for injury. That's why I also tested two gentler and cheaper activities: a book club with a creative writing class, and a life-drawing class (which, while physically safe, felt daunting in a different way – more on this later).\n\n3. Creative writing session: £3 ($3.80)\n\nWhen you're looking for social connection, does it help to choose an activity that is openly designed to encourage bonding? I tested this out by taking part in a creative writing session in East London. Facilitated by the London Girls Book Club who host a range of events alongside their monthly book club meeting, the session was designed to help people meet other writers, get inspired and have an opportunity to focus on a piece of creative writing.\n\n\"I've seen so many of the women create best friends through our club,\" says Caitlin Curry, who founded the London Girls Book Club four years ago after she moved to London from north-east England. In her experience, the shared foundation of loving books has enabled women to form strong friendships. \"At the start you might be seeing new faces, or you might see someone every so often, but the more that you come, you start to see similar faces and build those connections,\" she says.\n\nPsychologists have a name for this kind of bonding by engaging in, and talking about, a shared activity: \"triadic interactions\". In triadic interactions, we pay attention both to each other, and to an object or activity of mutual interest (on the other hand, a dyadic interaction is one where we only focus on each other). Both dyadic and triadic interactions are key to our early development – and continue to have bonding benefits for adults, research suggests.\n\nMost of the women attending the session had shown up alone, and everyone was approachable and open. After an introduction and opportunity to meet everyone, we had 30 minutes of quiet time, a break to discuss what we were working on and then a further 30 minutes to write. I did find that our shared interest in reading and writing, along with our shared goals as writers, made it easy to bond, despite being total strangers just an hour before.\n\nJavier Hirschfeld Creative writing groups and book clubs can be more affordable ways to socialise and meet like-minded people (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)\n\nThere are psychological benefits to creative writing, too, research suggests. One study by Plymouth University and Nottingham Trent University in the UK found that writing and discussing poetry as a means to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic helped people to cope with feelings of loneliness and isolation, as well as help to reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. A similar study published in 2021 found that creative writing may encourage personal growth and a sense of inner peace.\n\nBook clubs can also be an affordable way to socialise, especially if you borrow the book from a library. Reading may even have health benefits, such as cognitive benefits, potentially making it another hobby that provides a social as well as physical boost.\n\nFor anyone who is nervous about joining a book club, Curry offers the reminder that you always have the book in common if you're feeling shy: \"A lot of the women that come are very open, very friendly and they'll do things like follow up with each other… I provide friendship tips, we have name labels and we swap [around] so that you get to chat to lots of new people.\"\n\nHaving a class that was structured meant that people felt braver and more open to chatting with others. It can be hard to muster up the courage to start a conversation, so knowing that everyone would get a chance to speak provided a bit of light relief.\n\n4. A life drawing class: £15 ($18)\n\n\"I can't think of a better place to be an artist than London,\" says Ann Mackowski, artist and founder of Soho Life Drawing, a drawing group that runs weekly drop-in sessions in the heart of central London. Oh, and there's tea and biscuits.\n\nBefore I attended one of her relaxed life drawing workshops (also known as figure drawing), I would have told you that I am awful at sketching or drawing. Really awful.\n\nUnfortunately, I'd say the same thing now. But my skill level didn't matter.\n\nDrawing, especially when done in a way that makes us focus on the world around us, can improve mood and wellbeing, research suggests. As I quietly focused on sketching, it felt incredibly calming. I left the session feeling relaxed and proud that I was able to even sketch the outline of a body.\n\nYou get people coming in, they make friends, they come back… It becomes like a little family for some people\n\nAs with the other activities I tried out, I discovered that life drawing offered a surprising additional benefit beyond the promise of social connection: it can have a positive impact on body image. One study showed how it just took six weeks of classes to notice feelings of body pride and elevation. Another study showed that for women in particular, greater attendance of life drawing classes was associated with higher body appreciation, as well as and a lower drive for thinness and social physique anxiety.\n\nThe workshop consisted of sketching a naked person in different poses, accompanied by guidance from Mackowski through the first hour. After a break where we chatted amongst us (with aforementioned tea and biscuits), the session resumed with longer poses for the second hour. Mackowski created a friendly, safe and tranquil space for all, regardless of skill level. Some people were gently reintroducing themselves to life-drawing, others trying something brand new, others had been honing their skills for years.\n\n\"You get people coming in, they make friends, they come back,\" says Mackowski, adding that the connections people form through her classes has been one of the reasons why she's continued running them for many years. \"It becomes like a little family for some people. Then they might go to other classes together and venture out.\"\n\nJavier Hirschfeld As well as helping you to find an artistic community, some studies have shown how life-drawing can have a positive impact on body image (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld)\n\nIn fact, in a 2021 survey in the UK on the arts and social connectedness, 82% of participants responded that engagement in the arts was linked with feelings of social connection, belonging and collective understanding.\n\nMackowski adds that having an artistic community can help people both socially and from a technical standpoint: \"People develop their skills a lot quicker if they can see other people's work… and identify styles. So if you're in a room with 30 people and you can view their work, beginners get a good idea of where to go. And it's known to increase levels of creativity.\" At the end of our session, there was an opportunity to share your finished work with peers or Mackowski for feedback.\n\nA successful mission?\n\nIn terms of my original quest – to find out which activity would be best for making friends – all the ones I tried were a success. Each formed a gateway to a community and new friends, while offering other benefits I hadn't even thought about when starting this mission.\n\nEmbarking on a new hobby is, of course, just a first step – it may not be an instant solution to the widespread problem of social isolation and loneliness and the search for social connection. Still, my experience alongside the research on how we as a species bond through shared activities, suggests that it's worth trying out a new activity where you might meet people with similar interests to you. In fact, at the start of this year, 19% of Americans made a New Year's resolution related to a hobby or a skill, according to a poll by the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nIf you're not sure how to break the ice, here's an opening line I used several times when talking to my fellow boulderers, writers and aspiring artists: \"Have you ever done this before?\" Admittedly, it may not be the world's greatest or most eloquent – but it did the job of getting us chatting. And for me at least, that awkward small talk quickly led to genuinely enjoyable conversations – and shared moments of connection.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

    "content": "A 58-tunnel slow train through India's Eastern Ghats\n\n13 hours ago Share Save Anita Rao Kashi Share Save\n\nAnita Rao Kashi\n\nTake a four-hour slow train through the Eastern Ghats to discover how a remote hill station is changing the global coffee game.\n\nEven in December, early mornings are rarely pleasant on much of India's Andhra Pradesh coast. The air is already muggy by 06:30 as a crowd mills restlessly on platform five at Visakhapatnam (Vizag) railway station. However, these would-be passengers are no ordinary commuters, but travellers gathered for an experience. When the Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special rolls onto the platform, the crowd's relief is palpable; the two vistadome coaches at the back of the train that they've been anxiously waiting to board are air-conditioned.\n\nIndians have only a nodding acquaintance with the concept of queues, so a mad scramble ensues as the train comes to a halt. Things settle down as it chugs out of the station and gradually picks up speed. The Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special also serves as a regular commuter service headed to the town of Kirandul in Chhattisgarh state, about 400km to the north-west, and takes about 14 hours to traverse the distance. But those in the vistadome coaches are interested only in the first leg, to Araku Valley. This serene hill station is about 120km away but takes four hours as the train winds its way through a whopping 58 tunnels cut through the Eastern Ghats. The two vistadome coaches – with their extra-large windows and rotatable seats – are designed to provide panoramic views of the area's mountain peaks and valleys and its gentle forested slopes that end in rushing rivers and streams, gorges and rocky promontories.\n\nAs the train whizzes past Vizag's neighbourhoods and suburbs, it provides snapshots of a city waking up: a vegetable vendor hauling their cart, a dog walker pulled by his dog, two bleary-eyed uniformed children clutching onto their father on a scooter to school. As the city segues into wide open fields and farmlands, the images change: smoke curls lazily into the sky from a lone thatched house in the middle of a farm, a diligent farmer urges on his oxen, a tractor hauls vegetables to the nearby market. The rhythmic clickety-clack of the train's wheels is familiar and soporific.\n\nLess than 30 minutes after leaving Vizag, the train slows considerably and begins ascending into the foothills of the Eastern Ghats. As if on cue, most seats in the coach swing to face the windows. The train climbs, plains fall away and even the sporadic habitations clinging to the peaks vanish. Hills and mountains in the distance appear blue-grey in the tender morning sun. But even before this panorama can register, complete darkness descends as the train enters the route's first tunnel. I'm startled by the sounds of adults and children screaming, in jest of course, for the few minutes it takes for us to come out the other side.\n\nAnita Rao Kashi The train passes through a whopping 58 tunnels on its journey to Araku Valley (Credit: Anita Rao Kashi)\n\nWhen we emerge into daylight, the sight is jaw-dropping: a series of hillocks and gentle valleys, thickly forested, stretch out to the horizon where a haze-shrouded mountain range is just a hint of the soaring peaks to come. As I try to take in as much of the scene as possible, darkness descends again, and with it, more screaming.\n\nOn the other side is another surreal and dramatic sight: tracks bent around a hill, a green wall sloping straight up on one side, and a sheer drop on the other. The train slowly chugs forward, hugging the inner curve. The vistadomes' rear position means that the entire length of the train is visible, curling against the hill as if teetering on the edge. It then uncoils and wraps itself on the other side, trundling on a bridge built over a stream that gently flows several metres below. The bridge has no continuous guardrails, so, for a moment, it feels like the train is suspended in the air. But soon, the feeling is interrupted by darkness and more screaming, and another breathtaking view on the other side.\n\nTrain Journeys Train Journeys is a BBC Travel series that celebrates the world's most interesting train rides and inspires readers to travel overland.\n\nThis sequence repeats over and over again and yet it never gets predictable or boring. Each of the route's 58 tunnels sets up anticipation for what might lay on the other side. Thick curtains of mist clinging to mountainsides or low-hanging clouds cloaking the peaks; rolling grasslands and forests spread out like someone had shaken out a giant green blanket and laid it down; deep valleys and gorges surrounded by undulating peaks; and fleeting glimpses of hamlets and habitations perched precariously on the hillsides.\n\nWe stop every few minutes to drop and pick up commuters at musical-sounding stations that could be tongue-twisters to those unfamiliar: Pendurthi, Kottavalasa, Chimidipalli, Borraguhallu, Karakavalasa. At Shimiliguda, the station proudly wears its altitude on its sleeve: 996m above sea level. Throughout the journey, there is also a continuous parade of food vendors, delectable aromas wafting from their baskets as they sell idli-vada-chutney (a common breakfast of steamed rice cake with coconut chutney), samosa, savoury puffed rice and boiled peanuts.\n\nAlamy The train ride hugs hillsides, overlooks yawning chasms, trundles over bridges and provides stunning panoramic views (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWhen the train finally rolls into Araku town, the station is crowded and noisy and the magic of the journey dissipates somewhat. But early next morning, Araku's appeal is on full display. A short walk leads to forests and coffee plantations speckled with tall silver oak trees, their trunks wrapped by pepper vines. Everything is covered in thick fog and the air is nippy, a far cry from Vizag's mugginess. The air is sappy and thick with terpenes. I catch faint whiffs of coffee and pepper.\n\nCoffee came to Araku with the British and was grown in scattered patches of plantations. Like other coffee-growing regions in India, Araku was an ideal location owing to its combination of soil, altitude and weather. After independence from British rule in 1857, the land passed into local government hands, but decades of underdevelopment and sporadic insurgency kept the region off most investment maps. That began to change in the early 2000s.\n\n\"The local community wanted progress,\" says Manoj Kumar, CEO of the Naandi Foundation, a non-profit that works with farmers through community initiatives and sustainable models. \"So we looked around and thought since coffee was already growing in pockets, it could be expanded.\"\n\nWorking with local farmers, the organisation began establishing micro-plots of Arabica coffee using regenerative agriculture. What began at around 1,000 acres in 2002 currently stands at 100,000 acres farmed by more than 90,000 families, who each own about an acre on average. Besides coffee, farmers have been encouraged to multi-crop and now produce pepper, red kidney beans, ginger, turmeric, millets, rice, vegetables, fruits such as chikoo (sapodilla), mango, custard apple and avocado. The result: a unique fair-trade coffee model known as Arakunomics, which won the Rockefeller Foundation's Food System Vision 2050 Prize in 2020.\n\nAlamy The journey culminates in a pathbreaking initiative: ARAKU coffee, a first-ever terroir-mapped coffee (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBut the foundation didn't stop there. In a first for Indian coffee, they \"terroir-mapped\" the beans – borrowing a concept from winemaking – and classified the end product into six distinct flavour profiles under the brand name ARAKU. Selective harvesting, sustainable practices and meticulous post-harvest processes have helped the beans consistently score 91/100 on specialty coffee rankings.\n\n\"We grow about 2,000 metric tons of coffee, 98% of which is sourced by specialty coffee promoters across the world,\" Kumar says.\n\nTravellers can explore this story at various coffee holdings in the area, but Priya Rajagopal, a coffee enthusiast and former project manager in tech, recommends the Sunkarametta Coffee Plantation, about 13km south-east of Araku, where a wooden bridge runs for a few hundred metres through the plantation, suspended above the coffee plants and flanked by towering silver oaks. \"When I went, it was the flowering season (March to May) and the plants were full of white flowers, \" she says. \"The air is filled with a sweet, jasmine-like smell.\"\n\nA short distance away, the modest but informative Araku Coffee Museum offers a primer on the journey from seed to cup. The small adjacent café serves a robust filter brew – earthy, rich and perfect for a chilly morning in the hills.\n\nA few days after the train trip, back in Bengaluru, I head to the sole ARAKU cafe in India (most of their production is either exported, retailed in stores or available online), which is tucked away in the tree-lined avenues of the city's Indiranagar neighbourhood. I am torn between the various options but opt for their signature medium roast. It is beautifully rich red-brown and utterly mellow on the tongue. More importantly, a subtle peppery end note immediately transports me back to Araku’s mist-covered winding lanes, the lush green forests and plantations – and the slow, soulful train ride that led me there.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

    "content": "The people growing their own toilet paper\n\n5 December 2024 Share Save Soo Min Kim Share Save\n\nRobin Greenfield\n\nOne million trees worldwide are cut down each year to make toilet paper. Is it more sustainable to grow your own?\n\nIn Meru, a town in eastern Kenya, a lush, leafy plant sways over the landscape. Benjamin Mutembei, a Meru resident, is growing the Plectranthus barbatus plant – not for food, but to use as toilet paper. He started growing the plant in 1985. \"I learned about it from my grandfather and have been using it ever since. It's soft and has a nice smell,\" he says.\n\nPlectranthus barbatus is a leafy plant that can grow up to 2m (6.6ft) tall. Its leaves are roughly the size of an industrial toilet paper square and emit a minty, lemony fragrance. Covered in tiny hairs, the leaves have a soft texture. This plant thrives in warm tropical temperatures and partial sunlight and is widely grown across Africa, where it is sometimes used to demarcate property boundaries.\n\nMutembei is growing the Plectranthus barbatus plant to use as toilet roll in Meru, Kenya (Credit: BBC)\n\n\"This has been an African tissue for a long time, and everyone in my household uses the plant. I only buy modern toilet rolls when the leaves have all been plucked,\" Mutembei says.\n\nThe Plectranthus barbatus plant has provided Mutembei with a cost-effective alternative to purchasing toilet paper in Kenya. Like many commodities, the price of toilet paper has risen across Africa, largely due to the high cost of imported raw materials, such as wood pulp, which is essential for the production of toilet roll. Raw material costs now make up 75-80% of the final cost of tissue products in Kenya, according to the Kenya Association of Manufacturers.\n\nToilet paper made from virgin wood pulp currently dominates the global industry. \"Typical toilet paper is made of 70-80% short fibre hardwood and 20-30% long fibre hardwood,\" says Ronalds Gonzalez, a professor in the Department of Forest Biomaterials at North Carolina State University.\n\nAccording to research by the environmental impact consultancy Edge, roughly one million trees are cut down worldwide each year to make toilet paper.\n\nThe pulp and paper industry is the world's largest consumer of virgin wood, using roughly 35% of harvested trees for paper production. This is driving deforestation, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, species extinction and widespread ecosystem disruption according to the latest Ethical Consumer report on ethical toilet paper.\n\nMartin Odhiambo, a herbalist at the National Museum of Kenya who specialises in traditional plants, thinks the solution to the environmental impact of cutting trees for toilet paper may already be here.\n\n\"Plectranthus barbatus is the African toilet paper. Many young people nowadays are unaware of this plant, but it has the potential to be an environmentally friendly alternative to toilet paper,\" he says.\n\nCARBON COUNT The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nThere is no official data on exactly how many people use the plant as toilet paper in Kenya; however, it is widely grown in various parts of Africa and continues to be used in many rural areas where it is easily accessible, says Odhiambo.\n\nPlectranthus barbatus grows to its full height in 1-2 months from a cutting and the cutting itself costs around 50 Kenyan shillings ($0.37).\n\n\"The leaves are similar in size to an industrial toilet paper square, making them suitable for use in modern flush toilets or for composting in latrines,\" says Odhiambo.\n\nVisitors from across Kenya attend Odhiambo's lectures on the uses of Plectranthus barbatus and buy cuttings from his botanical garden at the National Museum of Kenya in Nairobi.\n\n\"My class has grown to over 600 participants. People are enthusiastic about learning how to use the plant and often ask for cuttings and seedlings to take back to their towns,\" he says.\n\nThe potential of the plant is also being explored in other countries.\n\nRobin Greenfield Robin grows over 100 Plectranthus barbatus at his nursery in Florida (Credit: Robin Greenfield)\n\nRobin Greenfield, an environmental activist who runs a non-profit advocating for sustainable living in Florida in the US, has been using the leaves of Plectranthus barbatus for five years.\n\nGreenfield runs a \"grow your own toilet paper\" initiative and cultivates over 100 Plectranthus barbatus plants at his Florida nursery. He shares cuttings for free or for voluntary donations, encouraging people to grow their own toilet paper. So far, he says he has distributed cuttings to hundreds of people.\n\n\"There are many people who associate using the toilet paper plant with poverty,\" says Greenfield, though he points out that industrial toilet paper is ultimately made from plants too.\n\nThe people growing their own toilet paper\n\nGreenfield says he's had positive feedback from people who have used the plant. \"For anybody who feels a little hesitant to try this plant, I would say to drop your worries about what people think about you. And simply by saying, 'I'm going to be me, and that might mean wiping my butt with some really soft leaves that I grow,'\" he says.\n\nBut how realistic is it that this plant might become more widely used?\n\nLarge-scale production has not yet been explored. Instead companies such as WEPA, one of Europe's largest toilet paper manufacturers, are reducing the environmental impact of conventional toilet paper in other ways. WEPA has developed a new method using recycled cardboard to produce toilet paper, which does not involve bleaching the fibres, a spokesperson says.\n\nTypically wood pulp is bleached before it is turned into paper, which releases chlorinated compounds into the environment. These compounds can react with carbon-based materials, creating dioxins which are highly toxic chemicals associated with cancer and other health risks, according to a report by the non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nThe toilet paper plant, meanwhile, is expected to have a \"minimal\" impact on the industry, says a WEPA spokesperson.\n\nOne drawback is that wastewater and disposal systems, especially in Europe, aren't designed to handle this type of paper, as only soluble items can be flushed through the system, the spokesperson says.\n\nGreenfield says that's where compost toilets come in. \"I use a compost toilet. The leaves go back to the earth and produce soil, which can then support food growth. It's a closed-loop system, and I think using these leaves could lead us to a conversation about the environmental benefits of composting.\"\n\nThere are also limitations on the locations and countries where of Plectranthus barbatus can be grown, says to Wendy Applequist, an associate scientist at the Missouri Botanical Garden. In South Africa, for example, Plectranthus barbatus is regarded as an invasive species, and growing or selling it is banned. Invasive species cost the global economy more than $423bn (£333bn) every year and are a major driver of biodiversity loss. (Read about the proven ways to stop biodiversity loss.)\n\nApplequist suggests that growing the plant in a controlled environment, within a designated area, and monitoring its growth to limit expansion into the existing ecosystem could help mitigate environmental risks.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge to going mainstream, though, remains public acceptance. But from his plant nursery in Nairobi, Odhiambo remains hopeful.\n\n\"I know some people see using leaves as toilet paper as a step backward, but understanding the benefits of this plant, I believe it could become the next green alternative,\" says Odhiambo. \"I've been growing it in my nursery and sharing it with communities across Kenya, and people have been amazed by its convenience. If we keep an open mind and continue promoting this plant, we could eventually mass produce it for widespread use.\"\n\nThis content was created with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

    "content": "The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'\n\n29 March 2025 Share Save Vittoria Traverso Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIt's mentioned 17 times in the Bible and was harvested in the Mediterranean for more than a millennium. Now, a farmer is reviving this ancient \"superfood\".\n\nIt's a hot and muggy summer day in Sicily's Madonie mountains, a rugged range of ridges about 65km east of Palermo. In a field of ash trees, the buzzing of cicadas is interrupted by a voice. \"You came at the right time,\" says Giulio Gelardi, a local farmer pointing towards a white-streaked branch. \"This is the famous manna.\"\n\nAlong the bark of each tree are thick lines of manna, a white mineral-rich resin referenced in the Bible 17 times that has been used as a natural sweetener and medicinal aid for centuries. Manna harvesting (the practice of cutting the bark of Fraxinus ornus trees to collect their sap), used to be a common practice throughout the Mediterranean. But in the past 80 years, urbanisation and industrialisation have led to it nearly vanishing.\n\nFor the past 30 years, Gelardi has made it his mission to put this Biblical superfood back on our tables, and today, this once-forgotten sap is being used by chefs and pastry makers in innovative ways.\n\nVittoria Traverso Manna is a white mineral-rich resin that has been harvested for more than a millennium (Credit: Vittoria Traverso)\n\nEven if you've never tasted manna, you may have heard of it. The phrase \"manna from heaven\" refers to a Biblical story where a food falls from the sky to nourish the Israelites as they crossed the Sinai desert. In Exodus, manna is described as a \"flaky substance as fine as frost blanketed on the ground\". While experts disagree what substance, specifically, this passage refers to, a honey-like, flaky and frost-coloured resin named manna has been extracted from the bark of ash trees in the Mediterranean region for more than a millennium.\n\nIn the Madonie mountains – home to the 40,000-hectare Madonie Natural Park – manna harvesting dates back to at least the 9th Century when the island was under Arab rule. During the Renaissance, Sicilian farmers used to collect this sweet sap – which tastes like cane sugar with almond undertones – and sell it to merchants from around the Mediterranean, a highly profitable trade that led the Kingdom of Naples to put taxes on it during the 16th Century.\n\nUntil World War Two, manna farming was a way of life for many Sicilian families. Footage from 1936 shows local farmers harvesting the substance, which was commonly sold to pharmaceutical companies to extract mannitol, a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and a diuretic. In the 1950s, scientists found a way to synthesise mannitol, and in the decades that followed, manna harvesting virtually disappeared.\n\nWhen Gelardi came back to his hometown of Pollina in 1985 after 15 years away, he realised that one of the core components of his local culture was vanishing. \"When I was growing up, everyone knew how to extract manna,\" he explains. \"When I came back, there were less than 100 farmers who could still do it.\"\n\nAlamy Pollina is a medieval hilltop town surrounded by the Madonie mountains (Credit: Alamy)\n\nPollina is a 3,000-person medieval town that seems sculpted out of the surrounding limestone hills. As a child, Gelardi learned to harvest manna in the summer from his parents. \"Manna harvesting involved the whole family,\" he explains. Men used handmade billhooks to make thin cuts along the bark, women collected the overflowing sap using dried prickly pear stems and children turned the goopy nectar into cylindrical cones called cannoli, due to their resemblance to the popular Sicilian sweet.\n\nAccording to Gelardi, the hardest part of manna harvesting is knowing when to cut the bark. Ash trees produce sap year-round but only produce enough resin to harvest during the hottest days of the year. Gelardi says if you cut the bark too early, it can cause the trees to stop making manna altogether. \"Finding out when the moment for cutting has come is a unique skill based on observation and intuition,\" he says, explaining: \"[It's necessary to] listen to each plant.\"\n\nFor example, leaves turning from dark green to lighter green with yellow marks may mean that a tree has reached peak manna production. Spotting cracks in the ground near the roots can also mean it's ready for harvest, as plants produce surplus sap to overcome dry spells. When the tree looks ready, manna farmers make a shallow cut in the bark and observe the plant's reaction. If a plant is mature enough, a small amount of resin will ooze from the cut. Farmers can then proceed to make deeper carvings, as small streams of sticky manna will flow towards the roots.\n\n\"Manna harvesting is not something you can learn from a book,\" Gelardi explains. \"If we don't pass these skills down to the next generation, we would lose centuries-old local farming knowledge.\"\n\nVittoria Traverso Gelardi has made it his mission to revive the ancient practice of manna harvesting in his hometown of Pollina (Credit: Vittoria Traverso)\n\nA few months after returning to Pollina, Gelardi set out to revive the waning tradition. At first, most locals did not meet his \"manna renaissance\" with enthusiasm. \"My friends thought I was crazy. They said manna was a thing of the past,\" he says. Undeterred, Gelardi spent months learning all he could about it.\n\nHe spent time with elder farmers to refine his harvesting skills and visited Palermo's public library to study manna. \"I knew manna was used locally as a sweetener, a moisturiser and a diuretic,\" he says. \"But I learned that it could also be used to treat food intoxication, a variety of skin conditions, arthritis and cold symptoms.\"\n\nGelardi also started to realise how manna shaped local geography and culture. For example, Gibilmanna, a nearby hill home to a famous sanctuary, owes its name to the Arab words \"gibil\" (mountain) and \"manna\". Local expressions are also shaped by manna, like the local phrase, \"vivere di mieli e manna\" (\"to live of honey and manna\"), meaning living an affluent life.\n\nIn 1986 Gelardi began handing out pamphlets containing facts about manna to tourists staying at a nearby resort. \"People were captivated by manna's healing properties and its impact on local culture,\" he recalls. By the 1990s, he was leading tours demonstrating how to harvest manna to international travellers. \"They started to see it as our local superfood,\" he says.\n\nVittoria Traverso Gelardi developed a new and more efficient way to harvest manna (Credit: Vittoria Traverso)\n\nManna is mostly composed of mannitol, a naturally sweet crystal compound, as well as minerals like potassium, magnesium and calcium. According to Vivienne Spadaro, a professor of botany at the University of Palermo, this thick white resin can be used as a dietary supplement to reintegrate minerals, especially potassium, and as a base for several medicines. \"Manna has been used to treat constipation, cough, sore-throats and skin wounds due to its decongestant and soothing properties,\" she says. And because of its low glycemic index, Spadaro says some manna can be used as a sweetener for diabetic people or those on hypo-caloric diets.\n\nWhere to find manna In addition to Hostaria Cycas and Nangalarruni, look for manna at La Manna di Zabbra. This family-owned B&B and restaurant in Pollina offers a salad of local edible flowers sprinkled with manna flakes as well as jams. If you visit between July and August, you can witness the century-old process of manna harvesting in the family’s ash tree field.\n\nWhile leading manna tours, Gelardi developed a more efficient way to harvest the substance with far less risk of contamination from bark or insects. He created a \"clean manna\" technique by attaching a small aluminum spout to the tree so that manna flows away from the trunk along a fishing line attached to the spout. This allowed Gelardi to nearly double his manna production.\n\nIn the following years, Gelardi started selling his manna to bakers and pastry chefs, who incorporated it into everything from cannoli, wafers, flakes and chocolates. He also sold manna to pharmacies to make laxatives, minerals supplements and skin products. In recent years French skincare companies Biotherm and Yves Roche have used it to make skin moisturisers.\n\nIn 2002, manna from the Madonie was declared a protected ingredient by Slow Food, an international organisation that promotes endangered food traditions. By the mid-2000s, manna became a sought-after ingredient for local chefs and pastry-makers.\n\nAlamy Today, manna is used by a variety of local and international chefs, including in nearby Castelbuono, Sicily (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"I started using manna to make pandolce (fruitcake) with manna and almonds, but then realised it goes well with savoury dishes, too,\" says Giuseppe Zingales, chef at Hostaria Cycas in the nearby medieval village of Castelbuono. The restaurant offers many manna-infused dishes, including manna-crusted pork tenderloin; risotto with asparagus, bacon and manna; and wild thistle flan with manna fondue. At another Castelbuono eatery, Ristorante Nangalarruni, chefs Peppe Carollo and his daughter Francesca use crushed manna to create one of the restaurant's signature dishes: suckling pig with almonds, pistachio and manna crust.\n\n\"The key is to [use] it well,\" Francesca Carollo explains, \"A small portion of sweet-tasting manna offers a nice contrast to roast meat flavour, but too much manna can make this dish too sweet.\"\n\nPastry chefs are particularly interested in manna. Nicola Fiasconaro, one of Italy's most famous patissiers, now produces a special edition of panettone, Italy's traditional Christmas fruitcake, made with chocolate and frosted manna, while Michelin-starred chef Davide Oldani featured chocolate-covered manna sticks as part of the menu of his Milan-area restaurant D'O from 2014 to 2016. In recent years, the Madonie's \"white gold\", as it is sometimes called, has reached a price of €200 per kg and has been used to make a variety of sugar-free baked goods, from muffins to biscotti.\n\nMost chefs buy manna from the Madonie's Manna Consortium, a cooperative created in 2015 by Gelardi and other farmers to market manna products and promote manna harvesting to younger farmers.\n\nAlamy Nicola Fiasconaro's pastry shop in Castelbuono sells manna flakes (Credit: Alamy)\n\n\"I grew up hearing about manna but had never learned how to harvest it,\" says Mario Cicero, who belongs to the Consortium. Born in Castelbuono, he spent years working around the world as a chef before returning to the Madonie. As part of his training, Cicero spent months with older farmers, including Gelardi. \"Giulio's taught me many tricks,\" he says, \"but he mostly passed on a contagious passion for manna harvesting.\" Cicero now tends 200 ash trees in his farm near Castelbuono and hopes that more young people will take up manna harvesting.\n\nSeeing young farmers like Cicero becoming ntaccaluori (Sicilian for \"cutters\") is what Gelardi is most proud about. As he explains: \"Every young person that learns how to harvest manna will ensure the survival of a centuries-old tradition.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

A new exhibition explores this close friendship, and how it benefited art history.\n\nOn 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin.\n\nA rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. \"Roulin… has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,\" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Van Gogh's Postman Joseph Roulin, 1888 – Roulin was a close friend and loyal ally of the artist (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nPaying homage to this touching relationship is the exhibition Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits, opening at the MFA Boston, USA, on 30 March, before moving on to its co-organiser, the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in October. This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.\n\nRoulin wasn't just a model for Van Gogh – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship – Katie Hanson\n\n\"So much of what I was hoping for with this exhibition is a human story,\" co-curator Katie Hanson (MFA Boston) tells the BBC. \"The exhibition really highlights that Roulin isn't just a model for him – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship.\" Van Gogh's tumultuous relationship with Gauguin, and the fallout between them that most likely precipitated the ear incident, has tended to overshadow his narrative, but Roulin offered something more constant and uncomplicated. We see this in the portraits – the open honesty with which he returns Van Gogh's stare, and the mutual respect and affection that radiate from the canvas.\n\nA new life in Arles\n\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in February 1888, believing the brighter light and intense colours would better his art, and that southerners were \"more artistic\" in appearance, and ideal subjects to paint. Hanson emphasises Van Gogh's \"openness to possibility\" at this time, and his feeling, still relatable today, of being a new face in town. \"We don't have to hit on our life's work on our first try; we might also be seeking and searching for our next direction, our next place,\" she says. And it's in this spirit that Van Gogh, a newcomer with \"a big heart\", welcomed new connections.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A pen, ink and chalk portrait of Roulin, 1888, is among the exhibits in the show Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nBefore moving into the yellow house next door, now known so well inside and out, Van Gogh rented a room above the Café de la Gare. The bar was frequented by Joseph Roulin, who lived on the same street and worked at the nearby railway station supervising the loading and unloading of post. Feeling that his strength lay in portrait painting, but struggling to find people to pose for him, Van Gogh was delighted when the characterful postman, who drank a sizeable portion of his earnings at the café, agreed to pose for him, asking only to be paid in food and drink.\n\nBetween August 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh made six portraits of Roulin, symbols of companionship and hope that contrast with the motifs of loneliness, despair and impending doom seen in some of his other works. In each, Roulin is dressed in his blue postal worker's uniform, embellished with gold buttons and braid, the word \"postes\" proudly displayed on his cap. Roulin's stubby nose and ruddy complexion, flushed with years of drinking, made him a fascinating muse for the painter, who described him as \"a more interesting man than many people\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Portrait of Joseph Roulin, 1889 – Van Gogh's paintings of the Roulin family were full of warmth and optimism (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin was just 12 years older than Van Gogh, but he became a guiding light and father figure to the lonely painter – on account of Roulin's generous beard and apparent wisdom, Van Gogh nicknamed him Socrates. Born into a wealthy family, Van Gogh belonged to a very different social class from Roulin, but was taken with his \"strong peasant nature\" and forbearance when times were hard. Roulin was a proud and garrulous republican, and when Van Gogh saw him singing La Marseillaise, he noticed how painterly he was, \"like something out of Delacroix, out of Daumier\". He saw in him the spirit of the working man, describing his voice as possessing \"a distant echo of the clarion of revolutionary France\".\n\nThe friendship soon opened the door to four further sitters: Roulin's wife, Augustine, and their three children. We meet their 17-year-old son Armand, an apprentice blacksmith wearing the traces of his first facial hair, and appearing uneasy with the painter's attention; his younger brother, 11-year-old schoolboy Camille, described in the exhibition catalogue as \"squirming in his chair\"; and Marcelle, the couple's chubby-cheeked baby, who, Roulin writes, \"makes the whole house happy\". Each painting represents a different stage of life, and each sitter was gifted their portrait. In total, Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the Roulins, a significant output for one family, rarely seen in art history.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Roulin's wife is portrayed in Lullaby: Madame Augustine Rocking a Cradle (La Berceuse) 1889 (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nVan Gogh had once hoped to be a father and husband himself, and his relationship with the Roulin family let him experience some of that joy. In a letter to Theo, he described Roulin playing with baby Marcelle: \"It was touching to see him with his children on the last day, above all with the very little one when he made her laugh and bounce on his knees and sang for her.\" Outside these walls, Van Gogh often experienced hostility from the locals, who described him as \"the redheaded madman\", and even petitioned for his confinement. By contrast, the Roulins accepted his mental illness, and their home offered a place of safety and understanding.\n\nThe relationship, however, was far from one-sided. This educated visitor with his unusual Dutch accent was unlike anyone Roulin had ever met, and offered \"a different kind of interaction\", explains Hanson. \"He's new in town, new to Roulin's stories and he's going to have new stories to tell.\" Roulin enjoys offering advice – on furnishing the yellow house for example – and when, in the summer of 1888, Madame Roulin returned to her home town to deliver Marcelle, Roulin, left alone, found Van Gogh welcome company.\n\nVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston The Baby Marcelle Roulin and Armand Roulin, both 1888 – Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the family (Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin also got the rare opportunity to have portraits painted for free, and when, the following year, he was away for work in Marseille, it comforted him that baby Marcelle could still see his portrait hanging above her cradle. His fondness for Van Gogh shines through their correspondence. \"Continue to take good care of yourself, follow the advice of your good Doctor and you will see your complete recovery to the satisfaction of your relatives and your friends,\" he wrote to him from Marseille, signing off: \"Marcelle sends you a big kiss.\"\n\nVan Gogh lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies\n\nVan Gogh's portraits placed him in the heart of the family home. In his five versions of La Berceuse, meaning both \"lullaby\" and \"the woman who rocks the cradle\", Mme Roulin held a string device, fashioned by Van Gogh, that rocked the baby's cradle beyond the canvas, permitting the pair the peace to complete the artwork. The joyful background colours – green, blue, yellow or red – vary from one family member to another. Exuberant floral backdrops, reserved for the parents, come later, conveying happiness and affection – a blooming that took place since the earlier, plainer portraits.\n\nArt history has also greatly benefitted from the freedom this relationship granted Van Gogh to experiment with portraiture, and to develop his own style with its delineated shapes, bold, glowing colours, and thick wavy strokes that make the forms vibrate with life. In the security of this friendship, he overturned the conventions of portrait painting, prioritising an emotional response to his subject, resolving \"not to render what I have before my eyes\" but to \"express myself forcefully\", and to paint Roulin, he told Theo, \"as I feel him\".\n\nCredit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A photograph of Joseph Roulin in 1902, 12 years after the death of his friend Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nHad Van Gogh not felt Roulin's unwavering support, he may not have survived the series of devastating breakdowns that began in December 1888 when he took a razor to his ear. With the care of those close to him, he lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies.\n\nLike the intimate portraits he created in Arles, the exhibition courses with optimism. \"I hope being with these works of art and exploring his creative process – and his ways of creating connection – will be a heartwarming story,\" Hanson says. Far from \"shying away from the sadness\" of this period of Van Gogh's life, she says, the exhibition bears witness to the power of supportive relationships and \"the reality that sadness and hope can coexist\".\n\nVan Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits is at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 30 March to 7 September 2025, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam from 3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

    "content": "Seven proven ways to help the planet in 2025\n\n2 January 2025 Share Save Isabelle Gerretsen, Zaria Gorvett, Martha Henriques, Katherine Latham, Lucy Sherriff and Jocelyn Timperley Share Save\n\nGetty Images\n\nSlowing down climate change is an immense task, but small individual actions can add up to help reduce emissions.\n\nIn 2024, the critical 1.5C threshold was breached for a full year for the first time, highlighting the urgent need to rapidly cut global emissions. Much of the work needed to curb climate change goes beyond the remit of individuals – from scaling up renewable energy to stopping the production of oil, gas and coal. But research shows that individual actions can add up too.\n\nBut it can sometimes feel overwhelming to know where to start. Which steps can actually make a meaningful difference? We have rounded up some of the most impactful actions you can take to live a more sustainable life this year, from eating more plant-based food to reducing your number of flights to buying more second-hand clothes.\n\nEat a plant-based diet\n\nBy 2033, it's thought that there will be almost two billion cattle, one billion pigs, 32 billion poultry, and nearly three billion sheep on our small blue-green planet – that's some 38 billion individual animals. As they go about their lives, all will be releasing the potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide – molecules which have effects 28 and 265 times stronger at warming the planet than carbon dioxide, respectively. That's not to mention the vast amounts of land and water required to keep them.\n\nAs a result, it's widely agreed among the scientific community that to rescue the global climate from ever-warming temperatures, one of the most impactful ways our species can change its behaviour is to eat less meat. According to one UK study, vegans have diets that emit just 25% of the carbon emissions of the most carnivorous meat-eaters, while both vegetarians and vegans have significantly lower water use and cause less harm to biodiversity than omnivorous ones.\n\nGetty Images Vegans have diets that emit just 25% of the carbon emissions of the most carnivorous meat-eaters (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn 2022, BBC Earth features editor Martha Henriques and senior journalist Zaria Gorvett decided to put this to the test, and tracked the carbon emissions of their meals over the course of a week. They found that the vegan diet did indeed have lower emissions overall, though on some days of the week the vegetarian diet won. Surprisingly, the amount of food waste generated and the cooking methods used each day also had a sizeable impact.\n\nRead more from the BBC about the climate benefits of veganism and vegetarianism.\n\nTake the train instead of flying\n\nTransport is the biggest source of emissions in the US, where it contributes almost a third of the total emissions, and makes up 16% of emissions globally. While infrastructure change is critical to helping people cut the emissions from transport, individual action can still can go a long way toward reducing this.\n\nIf you fly regularly, it's probably making up a huge proportion of your carbon footprint, so cutting out any flight is one of the best ways to live more sustainably. Using the train, bus or even a car with more than one person is nearly always lower carbon per km or mile. And reducing flying will also likely mean you travel closer to home, reducing carbon even further.\n\nWhat if we all stopped flying tomorrow?\n\nThis year one of our writers, Matilda Welin, even tried replacing an airplane journey between London and Sweden with a long-distance bike ride. While it cost more and took far longer than the plane would have, she experienced an \"unforgettable journey\" and enjoyed seeing the world \"at human speed\". She now feels prepared to do shorter long-distance bikes rides more often, replacing car and train rides.\n\nBuy fewer clothes\n\nSo how can you make your wardrobe more sustainable? The best thing you can do is to buy fewer new garments, especially fast fashion items which are often made from unsustainable materials.\n\nInstead, you could rent clothes, upcycle your existing wardrobe or switch to second-hand clothes in thrift stores or through online platforms such as Vinted, Depop or eBay. Currently second-hand or upcycled clothing makes up just 9% of the average wardrobe in the US, but it is growing faster than any other channel in the US fashion sector and is expected to be a nearly $90bn (£73bn) market in the next 10 years. Read more about how to make your wardrobe more climate-friendly.\n\nWashing your clothes less frequently can also help reduce your wardrobe's carbon footprint, by lowering energy usage, as well as prevent harmful microplastics from entering waterways.\n\nGetty Images Instead of buying fast fashion items, you could rent clothes or switch to second-hand clothes from thrift stores (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nReduce your carbon paw print\n\nWe love our pets. But research shows keeping animals is not always the most environmentally friendly thing to do. Take pet cats. They can generate over three tonnes of CO2 over the course of their life – equivalent to driving a petrol car 12,070km (7,500 miles).\n\nLuckily, there are ways to reduce our animals' carbon paw print. One option is to switch to more sustainable protein for their feed. The production of fish, for example, results in just a quarter of the emissions associated with lamb and beef. Another alternative protein gaining popularity in pet food is insects – which can be fed on food waste, and have a high feed-to-meat conversion rate.\n\nA simple – but perhaps surprising – way to make your beloved pooch more sustainable is to switch to recycled dog poo bags, as opposed to bags made from virgin plastic or compostable alternatives, which have a surprising climate impact. Read more about how to make your pets more environmentally friendly.\n\nConsider heating alternatives\n\nKeeping our buildings warm through winter is one of the biggest challenges in sustainable energy. Fossil fuels still meet 60% of the world's energy demand for heating, and emissions from the sector are still growing despite a rise in renewable heat.\n\nIf we're going to switch off our gas boilers – or at least turn the thermostat down for now, what can replace this source of heat to keep homes safely warm?\n\nTapping that tantalising waste heat is often a district or city-wide project. But lower-carbon options are also emerging for individuals.\n\nGetty Images By 2030, heat pumps could reduce global CO2 emissions by at least 500 million tonnes (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nHeat pumps are now one of the most carbon-efficient ways to heat homes, alongside thermal energy from solar. Installation costs for heat pumps have seen a modest decline internationally, with costs predicted to decline a little further to 2030, according to one analysis. They are still however an expensive upfront cost, though there are financial incentives for heat pumps in 30 countries.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that by 2030, heat pumps could reduce global CO2 emissions by at least 500 million tonnes, or the equivalent of the annual CO2 emissions of all cars in Europe today.\n\nIn the meantime, for those reliant on a gas boiler, basic fixes can help improve the efficiency of your heating and reduce energy bills – such as improved insulation, draught excluders and thick curtains.\n\nInvest in a greener pension\n\nWhen discussing sustainability, we don't often think of our personal finances. But how we choose to save, invest and spend our money can make a surprisingly big difference to the climate.\n\nRead more about why your banking habits matter for the climate. Your pension is one of the most direct ways in which you can make your spending greener. Pension funds are the largest investors in global capital markets, with total assets over $56tn (£44.5tn), making your pension an incredibly powerful tool. Despite this, most people don't even know how their pension is invested. A good first step is to ask your pension provider what they are investing in about their sustainability policies and options.\n\nRead more about how to make your pension more sustainable in this story by Jocelyn Timperley.\n\nGetty Images Caption: Research shows that individual actions can add up and help curb global warming (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nCut down on single-use plastic\n\nBuying loose vegetables is a great way to help rid your weekly shop of plastic, but often you still need to bag them in store – and the bags available are often plastic. The solution? Bring your own muslin reusable produce bag.\n\nPerhaps also have a think about where you buy your milk. Milk vending machines are popping up on farms all over the UK and the trend is beginning to catch on in North America too. You bring your own glass bottles (or buy one there), and fill up with fresh milk – eliminating the need for plastic packaging.\n\nYou could also start shopping at a zero-waste store, where you can refill your bathroom and plastic-free cleaning products. Once you've got a tin (either buy one from the store or reuse a biscuit tin), a soap dispenser, and a spray bottle, you just reorder the products as and when you need them, and they're shipped in paper packaging.\n\nSwap cling film for beeswax wrapping. Available in fancy patterns or just plain, they're forever reusable as they can be easily rewaxed with beeswax once it wears off.\n\nPlastic utensils are hard to recycle (at least in the US). So think twice about whether you really need them, or carry around a portable utensil kit, which usually come in neat carry cases. This applies to straws too. Paper straws aren't necessarily better for the environment, so you could include a reusable straw in your kit too.\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

    "content": "The Last of Us season two review: 'The plot twist tears the heart out of the series'\n\n10 hours ago Share Save Caryn James Share Save\n\nHBO (Credit: HBO)\n\nThe video game adaptation won many plaudits for its grim-but-humane first season. Amidst a semblance of civilisation, the second series is an uneven odyssey.\n\nDespite all the mush-brained infected creatures roaming around, The Last of Us was never really about the zombies. The series' first season worked so well because of the growing bond between lead character Joel and Ellie, the orphaned teenager he was hired to take cross country, who eventually becomes his surrogate daughter.\n\nThe zombies added danger, suspense and action, but the show's strength was its deeply felt depiction of how love survives even in a zombie apocalypse, with Joel and Ellie as a newly created family.\n\nSeason two takes a drastic plot turn, truly the most jaw-dropping in a hit series I can remember, a twist too stunning to spoil. Unsettling a hit can work brilliantly, as it did when The Bear replaced the first season's sandwich shop with a fine-dining restaurant in its second series. But the big alteration in The Last of Us is a devastating creative choice.\n\nThere are still high points and emotional moments. Pedro Pascal still gives a charismatic and wrenching performance as Joel, letting us see both the hardened survivor and the tenderness that has persisted. And Bella Ramsey still sharply defines the strong-willed Ellie. But the plot twist tears the heart out of the series, leaving a diminished version of the great show it once was.\n\nThe new season starts out strongly, though, picking up the story five years after it left off. Joel and Ellie are now settled in Jackson, Wyoming and the early episodes there smoothly evoke the feel of an old-time Western. The town is enclosed by fortified walls, and horse-drawn carts walk on the main streets. Citizens on horseback, including Joel and Ellie, patrol the area outside the gates looking for the infected.\n\nAlthough Ellie lives in the garage of Joel's house, she is furious at him and the show takes its time teasing why. You might think you know. As last season ended he swooped her off an operating table where surgeons might have used her immunity to cure the plague but would certainly have caused her death. (It's a TV drama, not science.) He killed people to escape then lied to her about it. It turns out that's not the entire cause of her anger.\n\nAround them, some captivating actors bring Jackson to life. Joel's loyal brother, Tommy (Gabriel Luna) is more central this season. As Gail, the town's irreverent therapist, Catherine O'Hara delicately balances some mordant lines with Gail's grief over losing her husband. Isabela Merced is especially vibrant as the energetic Dina, who has just broken up with her boyfriend, Jesse (Young Mazino). You can't blame Merced because the writers telegraph Dina's possible romance with Ellie too heavily from the start.\n\nThe story soon goes awry when it sends Ellie and Dina away from Jackson onto a dangerous road trip\n\nThe most thrilling, action-filled set piece comes early too, as hordes of the infected storm the Jackson barricades while townspeople shoot from roofs. But danger also comes from other places. Kaitlyn Dever plays Abby, a merciless new character searching for Joel, vowing revenge for his hospital attack. As in the first season, this one grapples with a society in which killing takes on a different moral meaning and even infected loved ones have to be shot.\n\nAbby is just one of the characters struggling with those questions: when is killing acceptable in this post-apocalyptic world? How do people separate vengeance and justice? That is still a bracing theme.\n\nBut the story soon goes awry when it sends Ellie and Dina away from Jackson onto a dangerous road trip. Scene for scene, the zombie attacks can be harrowing. The creatures look disgusting, brains spilling out of their heads as they leap out of the shadows in dark basements. But the attacks come too regularly and predictably now.\n\nAnd however much you might be rooting for Ellie and Dina to acknowledge their attraction, they spend so much time dodging the infected – as if killing zombies really is the show's point – that their relationship is no match for Joel and Ellie's. A flashback episode that fills in Joel and Ellie's five years between seasons is eloquent, among the best of the new crop. But it also reveals how much the series relies on the dynamic between them.\n\nThe audience for The Last of Us has always been split between viewers who know the video game it is based on (a group less likely to be shocked by any twists) and those who don't know or care about that. But the game can't be treated as a sacred text if it's going to work as television, and the first season brilliantly transformed it into a character-driven series.\n\nWith its scattershot emotional drama, too often this season feels commonplace, one more show derived from a game that may leave a good part of the audience cold.\n\n★★★☆☆\n\nThe Last of Us Season Two is available on HBO from 13 April.\n\n--",

    "content": "In search of Greece's once-great Jewish city\n\n3 days ago Share Save Naomi Tomky Share Save\n\nNaomi Tomky\n\nOnce home to a thriving Jewish majority, Thessaloniki holds fragments of a lost world. One traveller's journey to find them leads to something even more powerful: living memory.\n\nAs my family admired the gleaming remodel of Thessaloniki's century-old Modiano Market, local culinary guide Smaragda Marki admitted to me that among the trendy cafes and German delicatessen, she wished it were just a little more Greek. \"I wish it were a little more Jewish,\" I responded, staring up at the colourful Easter decorations.\n\nThe newly reopened market had topped my list of places to go in Greece's second-largest city, bringing together my two favourite things to look for while travelling: good food and tidbits of Jewish history. However, Modiano left me dissatisfied on both counts. Though the building still bears the name of its Jewish architect and stands on the site of the former Talmud Torah Synagogue, little else hinted that the nut stand used to be a kosher butcher or that Jews had any other part of its past life.\n\nThessaloniki was once considered an epicentre of Jewish culture, one of the only cities in Europe where Jews were the majority. Known as Salonika at the time, it was part of the Ottoman Empire until 1912. The Ottoman Empire allowed Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th Century to settle there for hundreds of years. But with Ottoman power beginning to wane in the early 20th Century, Greece took over the city in 1912. Five years later, the Great Fire of 1917 devastated huge swaths of the city and left 70,000 people homeless, including much of the Jewish population. The Talmud Torah Synagogue (and 31 others) were destroyed. The one-time centre of Jewish culture and majority Jewish city received its final blow in 1943 when Nazi forces deported 50,000 Jews to Europe's concentration camps.\n\nNaomi Tomky Thessaloniki's Holocaust Memorial commemorates the city's 50,000 Greek Jews who were deported to Europe's concentration camps (Credit: Naomi Tomky)\n\nEighty years later, I struggled to find traces of the community, and even finding a Jewish guide to show me around proved difficult. It wasn't surprising; Thessaloniki's Jewish community now numbers less than 1,000 people, a small population sample within which to find a niche professional tour guide. Plenty of companies offered tours of Jewish Thessaloniki, most touting bonafides by proximity to, rather than being a part of the small congregation.\n\nEventually, I booked through a company based in Athens because it was run by a Greek Jew. I still didn't know if my actual guides would be Jewish, though at least I could be sure they were trusted by the community.\n\nWhen Elia Matalon greeted us the next morning, I let out a sigh of relief. In the lobby of our hotel, he explained that he and his wife Hella Kounio-Matalon run their tours together and they both come from families that go back many generations in Thessaloniki's Jewish community. Later in the eight-hour tour he would tell us about how his mother survived the war by hiding in homes across the border in Albania while Kounio-Matalon spoke of her father surviving Auschwitz. We began walking toward a Holocaust memorial sculpture, through a narrow alleyway where he pointed to a restaurant owned by a gentile chef who became fascinated by the city's Jewish history and now serves traditional Sephardic Jewish foods like nogada (meatballs in walnut sauce).\n\nMuch of the city's history is Jewish history. In the Ano Ladadika neighbourhood, we stared up at the city's famous broken clock, stopped by an earthquake in 1978. The building originally belonged to a bank started by the Italian Jewish Allatini brothers, 19th-Century entrepreneurs whose flour company grew to be the largest in the Balkans before World War Two.\n\nNaomi Tomky The Jewish quarter once housed a large, vibrant community – but today there are few obvious signs of its past (Credit: Naomi Tomky)\n\nWe walked down adjacent Siggrou Street and paused in front of a 1926 mansion. Today, it houses a hookah bar, which meant we could wander into the lovely plant-filled atrium and up the grand staircase. Outside, Matalon pointed out the holes in the doorpost where a mezuzah once hung. A visible symbol of Jewish identity, the traditional decorative case holds a prayer, fulfilling the commandment to \"write them on the doorposts of your house\".\n\nSo much of visiting Jewish history around the world is like this: evidence of where we once were. Visiting the former site of the Jewish cemetery. Peering at painted-over holes and fading stars of David. Jews left their mark on Thessaloniki, but hardly in a fashion that hints to the glorious centre of Jewish life it once was. I love to imagine what it was like to live in these rich Jewish worlds, what could be if we weren't constantly getting kicked out of places.\n\nAcross the street from Modiano Market, we entered one of the city's two remaining synagogues. Because Thessaloniki's laws granted properties owned by Jews before WW2 without surviving family members to the Jewish community, the congregation owns the building, which mostly houses offices, and the synagogue on the ground floor. Marble tablets on the wall list the more than 70 synagogues that served the city's once much-larger Jewish population. The money the rent brings in allows the synagogue to pay retirees to show up to complete their minyan (the minimum number of people needed for a prayer service), a win-win situation.\n\nOutside the building, I learned how a bench signals that a piece of Thessaloniki's Jewish culture still lives within. The decorative wooden top looks the same as any other bench, a comforting and welcoming place to sit on busy Vasileos Irakleiou, between a synagogue and Modiano Market. Below, a sturdy cement bollard telegraphs its true purpose: these surround all the remaining Jewish sites in the city, protecting them from potential violence by vehicle.\n\nNaomi Tomky From a heyday of 70 synagogues, only two are left to serve the city's remaining Jewish population (Credit: Naomi Tomky)\n\nWe see them again outside the only remaining pre-WW2 synagogue, the community's other house of prayer. The Monastir Synagogue escaped destruction by invading Axis forces because the Red Cross used it during the war, a story that would be slightly more heartwarming if they hadn't nearly destroyed it themselves by using it as a storehouse and stable. It has since been returned to its stained-glass and marble-walled glory.\n\nA large tour group from a cruise, wearing headsets to hear their guide, filed in, and I browsed the tiny museum in the foyer until they left, just a few minutes later. Then Matalon and Kounio-Matalon announced that they had a surprise for us. Together, they offered to sing a song in Ladino, the ancient version of Judeo-Spanish spoken by the region's Jews: Adio Kerido (Goodbye, Beloved), a love song repurposed as a farewell to Holocaust deportees.\n\nBy the time they stepped onto the bimah, the raised platform at the front of the sanctuary, I had already seen the history for which I came: the train car parked permanently at the station in memory of the city's Jews, who were deported in similar ones; the mansions built by the thriving majority population of the 19th Century; and the lovely, solemn Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki. But as their voices joined, reverberating in the incredible acoustics of the large room, singing \"Adio, adio, kerido\", I realised I'd found something even better: a unique Jewish culture still alive.\n\n\"No kero la vida,\" they sang hauntingly, beautifully, mournfully, \"I don't want to live.\" The song offered such sorrow for the departing love, but it brought me such happiness to hear, to see this moment, the kind of moment for which people travel. A moment that could never be predicted, that could never be expected, and, more than anything, that could never happen anywhere else in the world except precisely here.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

    "content": "The stock market soared after Donald Trump secured the presidency last November, with the S&P 500 hitting an all-time high and staging its biggest post-Election Day rally in history. Market pros, including an investor named Scott Bessent, predicted that happy days were here again. “Recent days prove markets’ unambiguous embrace of the Trump 2.0 economic vision,” Bessent noted at the time. “Markets are signaling expectations of higher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans.”\n\nThose assumptions were grounded in the idea that Trump, hardly a classic conservative, would still embrace establishment approaches to markets and the economy. Lighter regulation, torrid deal-making and lower taxes were in the cards, and that alone promised better growth than the gangbusters economic performance of the Biden years. Or so the argument went.",

In some ways the simplest solution to the tariff problem is the one that I wrote about last Thursday. The US Constitution says that “the Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.” The power of taxation is the most fundamentally legislative function, so much so that the Constitution also says that “all Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.” This was at the very center of constitutional design, and in fact of the founding of America.

    "content": "The Tonito family is considering how much longer they can stay in the US as President Donald Trump continues to expand a crackdown on immigration, with a growing focus on Venezuelans like them. The Big Take Migrant Family Questions American Dream Under Trump The Tonito family endured a 14-month journey to reach a safe haven in the US. That prospect has vanished in two months under the new administration\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the Tonito family, the US was supposed to be a refuge.\n\nThey had endured a harrowing 14-month journey through South America, crossing the infamous Darien Gap jungle and roaring waterways, riding atop a freight train in Mexico—all driven by the hope of a more stable life.\n\nBut just over two months into Donald Trump’s presidency, that sense of security has all but vanished. Each new policy crackdown, with a growing focus on Venezuelans like them, feels like another step toward pushing them out.\n\nThey have watched as the administration moved swiftly to shut down asylum-seeking through the CBP One appointment app—the system their eldest daughter, who didn’t make it across Mexico’s northern border, was relying on. They’ve seen protections unravel, including the proposed cancellation of Temporary Protected Status for groups of Venezuelans like them. And they feel a broader effort at play: an administration intent on making life so unpleasant for undocumented immigrants that they may leave on their own.\n\n“When we decided to come to this country our dream was to have a better life for our kids, for them to study and graduate and have a career; maybe be a journalist or an advocate,” said Pedro, the family’s husband and father. “This is a country of opportunity. That was my dream.”\n\nThe Dream Interrupted\n\nPedro Tonito and his wife, Adriana, constantly worry for the future of their children, son Lian, and daughter Izzy.\n\nThe Tonitos arrived in the US in 2023, during a time of record US southern borders crossings. From the beginning it hasn’t been easy, but they’ve had small victories along the way. They found work, a home in Detroit, Michigan, and welcomed the birth of their youngest son, seven-month-old Lian, who is an American through the birthright citizenship provision that Trump is trying to ban.\n\nThe family is in a legal gray area. In addition to having a pending asylum case in federal immigration court, they’ve been approved for the TPS program that—at least for the moment—shields more than 1 million foreigners from 17 countries from deportation and grants them authorization to work. Though a court order has blocked the Trump administration’s plan to roll back protections starting next week, the efforts have still left the Tonitos, like millions of others, caught between the fear of deportation and the hope of building their lives in the US.\n\n“My dream was to have a better life for my kids, for them to study and graduate and have a career; maybe be a journalist or a lawyer. This is a country of opportunity. That was my dream.”\n\nWhen they first arrived in the US, the family surrendered to Border Patrol agents in El Paso, Texas. They were processed and, like thousands of other newly arrived asylum seekers coming across the US border by the day, made their way to a temporary shelter in New York City.\n\nPedro had plenty of work in New York—even traveling to Florida to help in cleanup efforts after Hurricane Milton devastated parts of the state. The hours were long and he hardly saw his family, but he earned enough last year that he received a hefty tax refund.\n\nIt’s that very money that would fund their move should they decide to leave the US.\n\nThe Tonito family moved to Detroit, Michigan, last year after first joining tens of thousands of other migrants in New York.\n\nAfter the birth of their son, the family moved to Detroit with South American friends, also asylum seekers whom they met in New York. They hoped the Midwest city would offer a quieter, safer life for their growing family.\n\nTheir friends rented a two-story home northwest of downtown Detroit, in a low-income neighborhood. The Tonitos share a single room on the second floor, helping cover expenses and sharing household duties.\n\nBut there’s been fits and spurts.\n\nPedro has faced periods of unemployment, but he and his wife, Adriana, are now working for a cleaning company that services a nearby Amazon facility. Their 18-year-old daughter ran away in February with a Venezuelan boy she met in New York. She hasn’t contacted them in weeks.\n\n“I came here for them, for my children, so they can study, graduate, have a decent job. So they don’t go through what we went through,” Adriana said.\n\n\n\nAdriana picks up her ID at an Amazon facility to start work the following day. Adriana works with a cleaning contracting service, working from 9 p.m. until 7 a.m. Adriana and Pedro do not have US driver’s licenses and have to rely on ride sharing apps. They miss the ease of commuting with public transportation in New York City.\n\n\n\nThe family they live with recently purchased a vehicle that remains in the backyard waiting for parts and papers. Pedro and Adriana cook typical Venezuelan meals at home—here they have prepared arepas, a flatbread made from maize dough that they have filled with eggs. A ride share car service picks up the Tonitos' youngest daughter, Izzy, and the children of the family they live with to attend elementary school. The state provides transportation for the children. Pedro trained and taught self-defense and mixed martial arts in Venezuela. He hopes one day to be able to teach again.\n\n\n\nPedro plays with his daughter and the child whose family shares the house. Izzy attends elementary school where she is learning English and enjoys math. Her favorite part of the US is the beaches in New York. However, when asked what she misses about Venezuela, she replied: her grandmother. Pedro said he is constantly worried about being separated from his wife and children, particularly as the Trump administration moves to deport some Venezuelans to El Salvador. With the closing of the CBP One app, their eldest daughter, Fedra, is unable to join them in the US, adding to the uncertainty for the family's future here.\n\n\n\nAdriana speaks on the phone with Fedra while Pedro plays with baby, Lian. “I came here for them, for my children, so they can study, graduate, have a decent job.

Fortunately, the local school district provides a rideshare for their youngest daughter Izzy, 7, because the family is considered homeless under federal education laws.\n\nIzzy is settling in at school, her parents said, and learning English. When asked her favorite subject, she shyly buried her head in her dad’s lap.\n\n“We have a lot of fear. More every day,” Pedro said. With his wife looking on, he said he wants his children, especially his US citizen son, to grow up in America. But he can see the writing on the wall.\n\nLian was born in New York in 2024. The youngest Tonito is a US citizen under a Constitutional provision called Birthright Citizenship. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order disqualifying children of many immigrants from gaining such citizenship. A federal court has for now blocked the order.\n\nThe US Crackdown\n\nThe Trump administration has rapidly expanded its immigration crackdown, engaging multiple federal agencies—from the departments of Defense and Justice and even the Treasury—to bolster the ranks of federal immigration agents at the border and in the interior of the country.\n\nImmigration officials initially pledged to focus the president’s promised mass deportation efforts on foreigners with criminal records, but the campaign has expanded to target those with temporary humanitarian protections, visa holders and even some legal permanent residents.\n\nMuch of the attention from the Trump administration’s immigration machine has focused on Venezuelans who officials have accused of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, declaring the group a terrorist organization.\n\nDemonstrators march during a nationwide “Day Without Immigrants” protest in Detroit.\n\n\n\nUndocumented migrants in the US have become increasingly aware of their rights, as advocacy groups across the country have expanded support such as legal outreach and workshops about how to respond when federal agents approach them at home or work. A recurring message throughout the protest was the positive contributions of immigrant-born residents to the region. A demonstrator holds a sign that reads in Spanish, “My parents fought for my future, now I fight for theirs.”\n\n\n\nFirst and second generation Americans showed support during the march. Demonstrators spoke out against ICE raids and mass deportations under the Trump administration. A protestor holds a sign in Spanish that reads “You Can't Silence Us!” Demonstrators march during a nationwide “Day Without Immigrants” protest in Detroit.\n\n\n\nUndocumented migrants in the US have become increasingly aware of their rights, as advocacy groups across the country have expanded support such as legal outreach and workshops about how to respond when federal agents approach them at home or work.

Demonstrators spoke out against ICE raids and mass deportations under the Trump administration. A protestor holds a sign in Spanish that reads “You Can't Silence Us!”\n\nThe administration reported tens of thousands of arrests by immigration agents in the early weeks of Trump’s second term, but officials have stopped releasing regular arrest or deportation figures, making it difficult to assess the current pace.\n\nThe administration has continued to publicize enforcement through social media images of deportation flights, including detainees in shackles being transferred to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Among them were scores of men accused of being members of a Venezuelan gang, who were deported despite a court order prohibiting their removal and Trump administration filings acknowledging that many had no criminal history in the US.\n\nBeatriz Lopez, co-executive director of the Immigration Hub, an advocacy group, said part of the Trump administration’s broad strategy appears to be creating a chilling effect. And the focus on Venezuelans, she said, “is low hanging fruit.”\n\n“They came here legally, through lawful pathways, are legally asking for asylum or have TPS,” Lopez said. “Most are recent arrivals and it’s very easy to identify them, to seek them out. It’s death by a thousand cuts and these are the easiest cuts to make.”\n\nMarchers hold a banner that reads “Out Immigration Officials, Papers for All.”\n\nToo Scared to Return\n\nOf the nearly 28,000 deportees the US has sent to Mexico since Trump took office, at least 4,000 are non-Mexicans, typically from Venezuela, Colombia or Haiti, according to the latest data.\n\nWhile many of them may decide to remain in Mexico in search of job opportunities, others hope to just stay long enough to earn money for the journey home. Few are considering crossing into the US by land from Mexico, with US southern border crossings falling to a historic low of about 7,000 in March.\n\nThe Casa Indi migrant shelter in Monterrey, Mexico, provides three meals a day for migrants from countries such as Colombia, Haiti, Honduras and Venezuela.\n\nDozens of people, many of them homeless, line up for dinner at a Monterrey shelter. Many of the migrants interviewed were deported from the US, where they don’t want to return because of Trump’s policies.\n\nThat’s the prevailing feeling at Casa Indi, a soup kitchen and shelter for migrants in Monterrey, where most of the people who were recently deported from the US have no intention of returning.\n\n“Since Trump arrived, they don’t want us there anymore. It doesn’t make sense to try to go there,” said Esteban Casas, a 43-year-old Honduran, as he picked up a plate of tortillas with green sauce and black coffee at the shelter. “I’ll try to find some work here in Mexico, wait a year to see if things get better, but right now I can’t go there.”\n\nIn Limbo\n\nFedra, the older daughter of the Tonito family, had difficult days in Monterrey, Mexico, after failing in her attempt to reunite with her parents and siblings in the US. “I would rather be in Venezuela than here.”\n\nTonito’s eldest daughter, Fedra, 21, was one of the many migrants stuck in Mexico.\n\nShe didn’t originally travel with the family over the El Paso border, but in February 2024, she started to head north to reunite with them. That moment has yet to come.\n\nAfter spending a couple of months in Monterrey, an industrial and tech hub in the north of Mexico, she decided in mid-March to head south to seek better opportunities in Panama.\n\nWhen Bloomberg met her in Monterrey, she was living in a half-built house with several migrants, most of them from Venezuela and one from Honduras. The structure was full of debris, construction materials and appliances like refrigerators that no longer work. Fedra didn’t own a warm jacket and struggled with the city’s cold weather.\n\nMonterrey is a business and industrial center in the state of Nuevo Leon, in northern Mexico. Fedra moved there to be closer to the US border, but she lost the chance to get a consular appointment to legally enter the US.\n\nFedra described how she’d lost the motivation to do almost anything—and the only thing that brings her joy is the video calls with her family.\n\n“I feel that my dad abandoned the idea of living in the United States because of Trump, but also because of me, because the logic of all this was to reunite with me,” she said.\n\nBefore Trump took office, she had been planning to secure an appointment to cross the border legally through a Biden-era smart phone app for asylum seekers, known as CBP One. Trump shut down the program on his first day in office, and has since revived it as a way for migrants to notify US officials that they’re self-deporting, renaming the app as CBP Home.\n\nFedra isn’t alone in her disillusionment. None of the four migrants she lived with in Monterrey plan to cross into the US anymore. They all say the same thing: They’re afraid of Trump’s policies.\n\nFedra cooks a meal on a hot pot, surrounded by work tools, in a house where she lived in Monterrey. A blocked off corner of a workshop where Fedra slept.\n\nFedra spent much of her time in bed while in Monterrey due to the cold and sadness from the uncertainty. “I've become very stressed here, I keep crying, I can't wait to be with my dad.”\n\nFedra washes dishes using buckets of water and a makeshift sink. Fedra stayed in the half-built house with four other migrants -- all unsure of their journey and afraid of Trump.\n\nVideo calls with her family in the US are one of the few things that puts a smile on Fedra's face. “I dream about going back with them, starting to work, buying a little house in Colombia.”\n\nIf the Tonito family decides to leave the US, they face a difficult dilemma: The country no longer seems to want them, but without Venezuelan passports, they can’t legally travel through Mexico or Central America to return home. And because the US has no diplomatic ties with the government of Nicolas Maduro—widely accused of rigging Venezuela’s presidential election and described by US officials as a dictator—there is no way to obtain new passports without first reaching the Venezuelan embassy in Mexico City.\n\n“We don’t have papers,” said Adriana. “We’re kind of trapped without passports.”\n\nWith no clear way forward, the family has decided to wait it out in Detroit, for now. Pedro said they are relying on their faith, but constantly in fear as more news surfaces of deportations to places like the El Salvador max-security prison under wartime powers.\n\n“There are so many unfair things happening right now that we have to hold on to the hands of the creator,” Pedro said. “In truth, because of what we are experiencing, we must trust God more every day and second that passes.”\n\nThe Tonito family has put on hold a final decision about whether to go home, holding out hope that things will change.",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Ryan Routh, the suspect in the second alleged assassination attempt against President Trump, has formally asked a judge to suppress statements from the eyewitness who identified him to police as the suspect with a high-powered rifle who was a few hundred yards away from Mr. Trump at his Florida golf course.\n\nProsecutors say Routh plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as the then-Republican nominee played golf on Sept. 14, 2024, at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Before Mr. Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent and fled, according to prosecutors. Law enforcement said the eyewitness statement was critical to finding and then charging Routh.\n\nIn a 13-page court filing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, the defense alleged police induced or were \"impermissibly suggestive\" when questioning the witness, who was allegedly shown a single photograph of Routh taken after he was detained.\n\nRouth's legal team claimed police created a situation in which an \"irreparable misidentification\" would occur and asked a judge to exclude the witness identification of Routh from the trial, which is scheduled to begin Sept. 8, 2025. The defense argued that the testimony would be \"constitutionally inadmissible\" in court.\n\nRyan Routh's booking photos. Handout\n\nWhen law enforcement announced charges against Routh last year, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said after police received a call from Secret Service at 1:30 p.m. that shots had been fired, a witness saw a man jumping out of the bushes and fleeing in a black Nissan.\n\nLaw enforcement found an AK-47-style rifle with a scope, two backpacks that contained ceramic tiles and a GoPro camera in the bushes at the scene, Bradshaw said. Secret Service officials later confirmed the suspect did not fire any shots and said he did not have a line of sight to Mr. Trump.\n\nThe Justice Department had also said a witness saw Routh running across the road from the golf course and getting into a black Nissan Xterra.\n\n\"Based on information provided by the witness, Routh was later apprehended heading northbound on I-95 by officers from the Martin County, Florida, Sheriff's Office, in coordination with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office,\" the department said.\n\nAccording to Routh's lawyers, the witness — identified only as T.C.M. — was driving to a furniture store when he heard three gunshots.\n\n\"The windows in his vehicle were up,\" they noted in the court filing. T.C.M. told police he saw a disheveled male run from the bushes out of the golf course and saw a person approach a black vehicle, drop something black and small inside through the sunroof, and then enter the vehicle, according to the document.\n\nRouth's attorneys said the witness took three photos of the vehicle and wrote down its license plate. The witness allegedly later told police he saw \"a white male, 6'2\" in height, light colored hair, and wearing a dark shirt and dark pants,\" adding that the person was \"a younger male in his twenties.\"\n\nWitness photos of the vehicle Ryan Routh was driving after shots were fired in the vicinity of President Trump on Sept. 14, 2024. Handout\n\nAn hour later, law enforcement officers pulled over Routh in a 2007 black Nissan Xterra, which does not have a sunroof, his legal team argued.\n\nThe defense argument said the witness \"had dozens of law enforcement from numerous state and federal agencies watching him, thousands of stranded pedestrians on the highway awaiting this airlift and show-up, and knowledge that his identification was necessary in a case involving presidential candidate Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"All of these circumstances created a heightened pressure to make the identification,\" attorneys said in the filing. \"It would not be difficult for any well-meaning individual to identify the one, and only, person law enforcement presented to them in this manner.\"\n\nRouth, 58, a Hawaii resident, has pleaded not guilty to attempted assassination of a presidential candidate, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.",

But a few countries were not included on last week's tariff list, including Russia, which the White House argues is already subject to sanctions and other steep trade barriers.\n\nPresident Trump's order features 10% tariffs on virtually all countries and higher rates on nations that Mr. Trump accuses of unfair trade practices, including major exporters like China and Vietnam. The move has roiled markets, with critics chiding both the steep rates and the unorthodox formula apparently used to calculate them.\n\nLutnick said Mr. Trump isn't backing off the tariffs that are set to take effect this week, telling Brennan they won't be postponed to buy time for negotiations and arguing the goal is to boost domestic manufacturing and cut the U.S. trade deficit.\n\nTiny island territories with few if any exports weren't spared from Mr. Trump's trade agenda, drawing confusion and even scattered speculation that a tariff list distributed by the White House was generated by an artificial intelligence tool like ChatGPT.\n\nHeard Island and McDonald Islands are located in a remote part of the Indian Ocean, some 1,000 miles north of Antarctica and 2,400 miles southeast of Australia. The virtually undisturbed islands are known for their penguin and seal populations, but Australia's Antarctic Program says \"human activities in the region have been, and remain, limited.\"\n\nThey're also far from shipping routes and often beset by rough seas, Australia says, despite Lutnick's claim that countries hoping to evade tariffs could ship goods through the islands.\n\nOther sparsely populated islands were hit by even steeper levies than Heard and McDonald's 10% rate. The White House says the British-controlled Falkland Islands (population 3,662) will face 41% tariffs and Australia's Norfolk Island (population 2,188) will face 29% duties. The tariffs on Norfolk Island drew pushback from Australian officials, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese calling the island's inclusion \"somewhat unexpected and a bit strange.\"",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "When the Palisades Fire ripped through Malibu three months ago, strings of beachfront homes burned to the ground. But since then, little has been done to contain the runoff, leading to a dangerous phenomenon threatening aquatic wildlife and other animals — including humans — that feed off it.\n\nTracy Quinn, CEO of nonprofit Heal the Bay, said recently tested water off Santa Monica revealed \"a lot of heavy metals.\"\n\n\"That debris is still sitting there within the high tide line. So every day the ocean is washing up and lapping those contaminants into the sea,\" Quinn said.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of sick animals washing up on the shores of Southern California, with one care center saying it is seeing four times as many as usual.\n\nAt the Marine Mammal Care Center, there are so many animals being treated that the nonprofit has had to build enclosures in the parking lot. CEO John Warner said part of the problem is animals are eating fish that have consumed algae containing a toxin called domoic acid.\n\n\"It's a neurological toxin. It affects their brains. They're having seizures. They're completely disoriented,\" Warner explained.\n\nAlgae with domoic acid is sometimes called red tide. It existed before the L.A. wildfires, but biologists suspect the wind storms that fueled the flames also stirred up sediment in the ocean. That, along with the nutrient-rich runoff, is feeding the algae.\n\n\"Whether it be with a fire or just organic waste flowing into the ocean, those all contribute to the size, scale, intensity of these blooms,\" Warner said. \"And we believe there's a direct correlation to the toxicity levels in the algae itself. They're at a high, high level during this particular bloom.\"\n\nThe hazardous contaminants from the fire debris could cause even more long-term problems.\n\n\"We're gonna see a lot of the animals that are lower on the food chain consuming a lot of those heavy metals,\" Quinn said. \"And then as those get consumed by larger fish, that will accumulate throughout the food chain.\"\n\nA problem that could potentially impact people eating locally caught seafood.\n\n",

    "title": "Supreme Court clears way for deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members to resume, but with chance for judicial review",
    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Washington — The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang using a seldom-invoked wartime authority.\n\nThe high court split 5-4 in granting a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in the dispute over President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without a hearing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in criticizing the majority's decision.\n\nIn its unsigned decision, the Supreme Court said the detainees who are challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act are confined in Texas, so the venue for their case is \"improper\" in the District of Columbia, which is where the dispute has been considered.\n\n\"As a result, the government is likely to succeed on the merits of this action,\" the court said in its ruling lifting two temporary restraining orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington that prevented removals under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nIt added that going forward, detainees subject to the 1798 law \"must receive notice\" that they face removal under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\n\"The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\" the court said.\n\nThe federal district court issued an order last month that prevented the government from deporting the migrants under the 220-year-old law while legal proceedings move forward, and the administration asked the Supreme Court to lift that order.\n\nThe decision from the high court to do so comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, as Mr. Trump's second-term policies have collided with the federal courts. More than 100 cases that challenge key aspects of his agenda have been filed across the country, and disputes challenging at least six of the president's actions have so far reached the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.\n\nThe ongoing fight over Mr. Trump's effort to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants is one of the most high-profile of the cases, and the district court's decision temporarily blocking the removals sparked calls from the president and his GOP allies for the judge presiding over the dispute to be impeached.\n\nIn its decision, the court said the opinion confirms that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.\n\n\"The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we hold that venue lies in the district of confinement,\" it said.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, and joined in part by Barrett. She called the majority's legal conclusion \"suspect\" and accused the Trump administration of largely ignoring \"its obligations to the rule of law.\"\n\n\"The government's conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" Sotomayor wrote.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh highlighted the area of agreement among the court. All nine justices, he wrote, agree that judicial review is available. But he said they split as to where that review should take place.\n\nMr. Trump wrote on social media after the ruling, \"The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself. A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cheered the ruling with a warning to migrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying in a statement, \"leave now or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.\"\n\nLee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued before the lower courts, told CBS News, \"We are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but the critical point is that the court rejected the government's remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is a big victory.\"\n\nMr. Trump signed a proclamation under the Alien Enemies Act last month, claiming that Tren de Aragua is \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" against the U.S. and declaring that all members of the gang in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to immediate detention and removal. The law had previously been invoked three times, and only during declared wars.\n\nThe day after Mr. Trump's proclamation, five Venezuelan nationals who were being held at a detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act violated the terms of the law and asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., to block their removals.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg swiftly agreed to stop their deportations for 14 days and later expanded his temporary order to prohibit the administration from removing all noncitizens in U.S. custody who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation. The judge allowed deportations under other legal authorities. A hearing on a request for a longer preliminary injunction is set for April 8, though it's unclear whether that will proceed as scheduled.\n\nBoasberg is also separately examining the circumstances surrounding the removal of 137 people under the Alien Enemies Act who were on planes bound for El Salvador while proceedings unfolded. The deportations raised questions as to whether the Trump administration violated an oral order from Boasberg calling for any planes carrying migrants subject to removal under the law to return to the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration appealed Boasberg's temporary order, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last month declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations. The appeals court divided 2-1 in turning down the government's request to halt Boasberg's directive.\n\nIn the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act grants the president sweeping national security authority.\n\nThe district court's order, she argued in a filing, is \"forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans. Those orders — which are likely to extend additional weeks — now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"\n\nThe administration also reiterated its request that the Supreme Court step in to curb the temporary restraining orders that have been issued by federal judges and block enforcement of a policy nationwide.\n\n\"Here, the district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"\n\nBut lawyers for the Venezuelan migrants accused the president of stretching the limits of the Alien Enemies Act, which they said risked allowing the government to \"immediately begin whisking away anyone\" it unilaterally claims is a member of a criminal gang to a foreign prison.\n\n\"The president's effort to shoehorn a criminal gang into the AEA, on a migration-equals-invasion theory, is completely at odds with the limited delegation of wartime authority Congress chose to give him through the statute,\" they wrote in a filing.\n\nThey also argued that many of the people flown out of the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison are not members of Tren de Aragua, and at least eight were Venezuelan women who were returned to the U.S.\n\nAllowing the deportations to resume would have devastating consequences for their clients, the lawyers said. Already, 130 Venezuelan men have been sent to El Salvador, where they have been \"confined, incommunicado, in one of most brutal prisons in the world, where torture and other human rights abuses are rampant,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Without the TRO, plaintiffs will suffer extraordinary and irreparable harms — being sent out of the United States to a Salvadoran prison, where they will remain incommunicado, potentially for the rest of their lives, without having had any opportunity to contest their designation as gang members,\" lawyers for the migrants said.\n\nThe dispute before the Supreme Court comes as the justices are considering a separate request from the Trump administration to lift a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador to the United States.\n\nThe man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was among those on the deportation flights at issue in the case involving the Alien Enemies Act, but he was removed under a different immigration law. Chief Justice John Roberts earlier Monday temporarily paused the district court's order that set an 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline for the government to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

    "content": "Trump national security spokesman Brian Hughes was the intended recipient of the Signal group chat invitation when Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeff Goldberg was added instead due to a cellphone snafu a few months ago, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.\n\nNational Security Advisor Mike Waltz's phone asked him last fall to save an unknown phone number – which had been messaged to him from Hughes, one of his closest advisers – as a new number for Hughes, sources said.\n\nOn March 24, Goldberg reported that he was added to a private group chat that appeared to include senior Trump officials coordinating ahead of airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Trump officials later confirmed its authenticity.\n\nAdministration IT team members looked into the incident, and President Trump and other top White House officials were briefed on the investigation's findings last week.\n\nThe internal review found no previous phone communications between Waltz and Goldberg — or Hughes and Goldberg — until an email from Goldberg was sent to the Trump campaign in October.\n\nGoldberg had written to the campaign asking for comment on a story related to Mr. Trump and the military.\n\nCampaign officials wanted to loop in Trump surrogates such as Waltz, a military veteran.\n\nAfter discussions with campaign aide Steven Cheung and others, Hughes copied and pasted the email from Goldberg, with Goldberg's email address and cellphone number, and messaged it to Waltz, two of the sources said.\n\nWaltz's cellphone captured the phone number in the message and asked to save it as a new number for \"Brian Hughes.\"\n\nWaltz correctly called and messaged the real-life Hughes many times after that — his phone apparently didn't conflate Goldberg's number and Hughes' until after Waltz was in Jeddah, Saudi Arabi in March.\n\nWhen Waltz tried to add Hughes to the Signal chat, it invited the wrong Hughes number from his phone rolodex. Signal, knowing the number belonged to Goldberg, apparently identified him as \"JG.\" But no one in the Trump national security team chat noticed, several sources said.\n\nThe administration wasn't aware Goldberg was in the confidential chat until The Atlantic reached out to the White House for comment a couple hours before publication of their story, one of the sources said.\n\nWhite House spokespeople did not immediately respond on Sunday to a CBS News request for comment.\n\nThe cellphone feature that led to Goldberg being mistakenly added to the Signal chat instead of Hughes was first reported by The Guardian.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

    "content": "The funeral of 14-year-old Palestinian-American Amir Mohammed Rabee was held Monday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, one day after the dual national from New Jersey was shot and killed there. Two other teenage boys, one whose family told CBS News he is also a U.S. citizen, were shot but survived.\n\nRabee's father told CBS News on Monday that his son's siblings live in the U.S., but that Amir and his parents were living in Turmus Ayya, in the central West Bank, where the teenager was attending school.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that IDF soldiers had \"identified three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving. The soldiers opened fire towards the terrorists who were endangering civilians, eliminating one terrorist and hitting two additional terrorists.\"\n\nMourners react as they carry the body of Palestinian-American Amir Mohammad Rabee, 14, during his funeral near Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, April 7, 2025. Ammar Awad/REUTERS\n\nAlong with its statement, the IDF released a 10-second video clip that appears to show three people throwing items. The people are not identifiable in the grainy video.\n\nRabee's father said his son cannot be identified in the video, and he believes the three teenage boys were shot while throwing stones at an almond tree.\n\n\"The video they [IDF] published is not right, and no one can prove my son was there,\" Rabee's father told journalists on Monday. \"Unfortunately, the U.S. embassy believed the Israeli narrative based on unclear video, but the U.S. embassy turns a blind eye on videos filmed by people and journalists of settler violence — killing, burning and stealing, guarded by the IDF.\"\n\nA screengrab from a 10-second video released by the Israel Defense Forces shows three people whom the IDF said were \"terrorists who hurled rocks toward\" a highway in the village of Turmus Ayya, in the occupied West Bank on April 6, 2025. The IDF said soldiers opened fire at the individuals, hitting all three and killing one, who was later identified as 14-year-old U.S.-Palestinian dual national Amir Mohammed Rabee. HANDOUT/Israel Defense Forces\n\nCBS News asked the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem about the incident and Rabee's father's claim that American officials had accepted the Israeli military's explanation of the shooting; the embassy said it had referred the query to the U.S. State Department. A State Department spokesperson offered condolences to the family and said the U.S. was aware of the IDF's statement, but said out of respect for the family's privacy would have no other comment at this time.\n\nRabee's father said it appeared his son had been shot with two different guns, and that two bullets had entered his heart, two had struck his head, two had hit his shoulders, and then five others had hit his body.\n\n\"It was a field execution,\" Rabee's father said.\n\nAsad Ayub Ahed, the other 14-year-old U.S. national who was shot alongside Rabee and al-Rahman, was still in a hospital in serious condition on Monday.\n\nThe incident came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to Washington with plans to meet at the White House on Monday with President Trump.\n\n\"We have to… send a message for President Trump to at least stop this situation,\" Rabee's father told CBS News. \"Stop sending weapons to kill.\"\n\nAnother American, U.S.-Turkish dual national Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, was killed in the West Bank in September. Witnesses, her family, and the group Eygi had joined at a protest in the occupied Palestinian territory said she was shot in the head by an Israeli sniper as she stood under a tree in the West Bank city of Nablus. The IDF said an initial inquiry into Eygi's death \"found that it is highly likely that she was hit indirectly and unintentionally by IDF fire which was not aimed at her.\"\n\nSaed Hawari and Omar Abdulkader contributed to this report.",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Children have always been at the mercy of the lottery of their birthplace.\n\nFor Gaza's young, that's meant a homeland ruled by a terrorist organization, Hamas; decades of war and tension with the neighboring state of Israel; and life in one of the world's poorest and most densely populated places.\n\nBut for Gaza's children, it was home.\n\nFor this week's 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley spoke to a group of kids who were medevaced from Gaza to Qatar to be treated for their injuries in the current war. There, 60 Minutes got a look at what it will take to heal — and what it will mean to go home.\n\n\"Life was good,\" a 16-year-old girl named Sara told Pelley when asked about life in Gaza before the war. \"Even though it wasn't luxurious, we were content. We could go out and about, and family gatherings were something special.\"\n\nHer younger sister, Lama, agreed. \"Gaza was more than just a city,\" she said. \"It was our little paradise.\"\n\nTheir \"paradise\" was lost on Oct. 7, 2023. Hamas attacked Israel, an atrocity that murdered 1,200 civilians — including 40 children — and captured 251. Israel's war to free its hostages and defeat Hamas has killed 50,000 — including 15,000 children — according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nIsrael says Hamas fighters embed themselves in civilian areas and underneath hospitals.\n\nThe U.N. says Gaza is now the deadliest place on Earth to be a child — and children under 18 make up nearly half of the population.\n\nSurviving children have lost limbs and loved ones and now must heal where hospitals themselves are in critical condition. But a few lucky ones have made it out. During the siege, Israel has allowed the occasional evacuation of the critically wounded, so more than 300 children left Gaza for one of the richest places on earth: Doha, Qatar.\n\nThere, the $8 billion Sidra Medicine, a hospital for women and children, dedicated a ward to Gaza's wounded young.\n\nAt Sidra, an 11-year-old boy named Yahya underwent skull surgery and a bone graft to heal him from the airstrike that killed both of his parents.\n\n\"The whole building we were in was bombed,\" he told Pelley. \"I opened my eyes in the hospital and had no idea where I was.\"\n\nWhen 16-year-old Sara was injured, she said she was sheltering inside a house when it was bombed. Her brother and twin sister died.\n\n\"When they took me to the hospital, I did not feel anything,\" she said. \"I did not even feel that I was suffering from burns. None of the injured felt that they were injured. All I could see was black ash covering my arms.\"\n\nIn Doha, 60 Minutes watched as the Palestinian kids returned to the essential work of childhood: play. They're living in housing that was built for the 2022 World Cup, its green astroturf a stark contrast to the muted gray dust of Gaza today.\n\n60 Minutes wanted to know: After all that has happened, is Gaza still home? How many of these children want to return?\n\nWhen Pelley asked the question, every child's hand shot up.\n\n\"I want to go back to Gaza,\" Sara said. \"I want to create new memories there. Even though the people who passed away are gone, I want to go back to visit their graves and rebuild Gaza. I want to become an engineer so I can rebuild it and make it even better than before.\"\n\nA 10-year-old girl named Fatima told Pelley she wants to return to see her siblings again. \"It's been so long,\" she said. \"I want to become a neurologist to help heal the injured children in Gaza.\"\n\nYahya told Pelley he, too, wants to return to Gaza to reunite with his extended family — and to help his homeland. \"I've decided to pursue engineering,\" he said. \"While I used to aspire to be a doctor, I now feel drawn to engineering, both to contribute to my country's reconstruction and because it's something I'm passionate about.\"\n\nHealing the landscape of Gaza will take a generation — their generation, the children of war. One of these children came to Doha with shrapnel in her skull and came to the 60 Minutes interview with a song on her lips.\n\nShe sang \"Atouna El Toufoule,\" a song popularized in Lebanon in the early 1980s. \"My land is small, just like me,\" the lyrics go. \"Give us peace, give us childhood, give us peace.\"\n\nThe video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and edited by Scott Rosann.",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Examining the influence of oil and gas companies in college sports advertising\n\nAmericans love college sports, and so do oil and gas companies.\n\nAbout 96% of more than 2,000 fossil fuel ads aired during live national games between 2022 and 2024 were during college football and basketball, compared to about 4% for professional sports, according to a CBS News data analysis of data from television ad tracking firm, iSpot.tv.\n\nDuncan Meisel, a climate activist and a leading voice against advertising by fossil fuel companies, said many of these ads during televised games talk about supporting communities and the environment without ever acknowledging the industry's role in climate change.\n\n\"The problem is they're selling a product that they know harms people, that they know harms the planet,\" Meisel said.\n\nAbout one in ten of the more than 2,000 ads carried a pro-climate message, like recycling cooking oil for renewable diesel, \"sustainable\" aviation fuel, lower carbon emissions or fuel made from corn.\n\nWhile Meisel didn't dispute the accuracy of these claims, he emphasized that they're not these companies' main goal, and likely a very small percentage of what they produce.\n\nCBS News reached out to Valero for comment on its ads highlighting renewable diesel and aviation fuel, but the company has not responded in time for this story's publication.\n\nIt's an effective business strategy to advertise during college sports, according to Peter Carton, who directs the Sports Management program at Southern Methodist University.\n\nCarton said the college sports demographic tends to be middle-to-upper income. The return on investment for these companies is higher than for pro sports, because it's cheaper to advertise.\n\n\"When they look at where do they want to put their advertising dollars and marketing dollars to reach certain demographics, college is much more efficient,\" Carton said.\n\n\"You're very familiar, I'm sure we all are, with the cost of advertising on the Super Bowl. That's outside of the reach of many, many companies. But to be able to get a very passionate, dedicated consumer base, that's the college market,\" he said.\n\nThe motive is less straightforward to climate activist Meisel, whose non-profit Clean Creatives convinced more than 1,300 ad firms to cut ties with fossil fuel companies. One of those fossil fuel companies is Energy Transfer, a Texas-based pipeline company that doesn't sell products to consumers, but still advertises locally.\n\n\"I think it gets to the heart of a lot of fossil fuel advertising, which is essentially lobbying in public,\" said Meisel.\n\nEnergy Transfer provided a statement to CBS News that said, \"Overall, we are trying to reach as many people as possible to further their understanding of the importance of oil and natural gas not only in the manufacturing sector but as one of our country's primary economic drivers.\"\n\nIt's a message fossil fuel companies hope will resonate with college sports fans.",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Washington — President Trump announced Monday that the U.S. would begin direct engagement with Iran.\n\nDuring a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump said that \"we're having direct talks with Iran,\" beginning Saturday. \"We have a very big meeting, and we'll see what can happen,\" he said. The president said Iran is \"going to be in great danger\" if the direct talks don't go well.\n\nHours later, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi confirmed talks were set for Saturday in Oman, but referred to them as \"indirect high-level talks.\"\n\n\"It is as much an opportunity as it is a test. The ball is in America's court,\" he wrote on social media.\n\nMr. Trump's meeting with Netanyahu took place as new tariffs the president is levying on Israel and the rest of the world are about to go into effect on Wednesday. The U.S. is set to impose 17% tariffs on imports from Israel, effective Wednesday. Other nations, too, are scrambling to try to reverse Mr. Trump's tariffs.\n\nNetanyahu said he told Mr. Trump that Israel would soon address his country's trade deficit with the U.S.\n\n\"I can tell you that I said to the president, a very simple thing — we will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States,\" Netanyahu said. \"We intend to do it very quickly. We think it's the right thing to do. And we're also going to eliminate trade barriers.\"\n\nStill, Mr. Trump didn't indicate he's quite ready to eliminate tariffs on imports from Israel.\n\n\"Well, we're talking about a whole new trade — maybe not, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said in response to a reporter's question. \"Don't forget, we help Israel a lot.\"\n\nThe Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones were whipsawing Monday after two consecutive days of losses last week, the biggest two-day drop of the stock market since the pandemic in March 2020.\n\nThe president was asked by a reporter if he's considering a pause on the tariffs to ease the turmoil in the markets.\n\n\"Well, we're not looking at that,\" the president replied. \"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals.\"\n\nThe president said of the the tariffs he is imposing, \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"\n\nBut he left open the possibility that some countries could reduce their tariffs. \"There also can be negotiations,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe White House canceled a scheduled joint news conference with Mr. Trump and Netanyahu abruptly and without explanation just ahead of the Israeli leader's arrival.\n\nTrump, Netanyahu to meet about tariffs, Israel-Gaza conflict\n\nAhead of the Netanyahu meeting, Mr. Trump held a joint phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Egyptian President Fattah al-Sisi and King Abdullah of Jordan, according to a Jordanian official.\n\nIt's Netanyahu's second visit to the White House since Mr. Trump took office in January. Netanyahu also visited Mr. Trump in early February. Since Mr. Trump and Netanyahu last met, the fragile ceasefire between Hamas and Israel has broken. Israel has since renewed its military offensive in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe president's decision to levy tariffs on friends and foes alike is not only roiling the markets, but setting the United States' relationships with traditional allies on unsure footing. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old U.S.-Canada relationship is \"over\" and Canada will need to \"dramatically reduce\" its reliance on the U.S.",

    "title": "Chief Justice Roberts temporarily pauses lower court order requiring return of Maryland man deported to El Salvador",
    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Washington — Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily paused a lower court's order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man who was mistakenly arrested and removed to El Salvador back to the U.S. by 11:59 p.m. Monday.\n\nRoberts' administrative stay gives the Supreme Court more time to consider the matter and will remain in place \"pending further order of the undersigned or of the court,\" it states. He issued his order hours after the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the legal battle over the removal of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia last month.\n\nThe Justice Department's request for emergency relief from the high court came as it faced a court-ordered 11:59 p.m. deadline to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. He was deported to a Salvadoran supermax prison on March 15 despite a 2019 protective order that should have prevented him from being sent to the country.\n\nThe Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to block that district court order, claiming that it \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it cannot compel El Salvador to \"follow a federal judge's bidding.\"\n\n\"The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the Justice Department welcomed the chief justice's stay \"as we continue to fight this case and protect the executive branch from judicial overreach.\"\n\nThe dispute over Abrego Garcia's removal sparked widespread attention and outrage after the Trump administration admitted in a court filing last week that his deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\" The 29-year-old father was removed from the U.S. on a series of deportation flights transporting hundreds of people to the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT.\n\nThose flights are at the center of a separate high-profile court battle involving President Trump's attempts to use the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. The Supreme Court is currently weighing a separate request from the Justice Department to allow it to resume deportations using the seldom-invoked authority.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old, according to court records. In 2019, he was arrested alongside three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities while an immigration judge examined his case.\n\nDuring a bond hearing before the immigration judge, the Department of Homeland Security put forth evidence claiming that a \"proven and reliable source\" confirmed Abrego Garcia had ties to the MS-13 gang. The judge denied his request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board.\n\nAbrego Garcia's attorneys have argued in court filings that the only evidence of his alleged gang ties came from a confidential informant who claimed he was an active member of MS-13 and the fact that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and sweatshirt when he was arrested. They also said Abrego Garcia has no criminal history. \"He has never been charged or convicted of any criminal charges, in the United States, El Salvador, or any other country,\" his lawyers wrote.\n\nAbrego Garcia was released from federal custody after another immigration judge granted him a \"withholding of removal\" to El Salvador, a legal status that bars officials from removing individuals who prove they are more likely than not to be subject to persecution in their home country. In the order, the judge found that if Abrego Garcia returned to El Salvador, he would likely face persecution by local gangs.\n\nAbrego Garcia's wife told CBS News that her husband attended regular check-ins with immigration authorities after he was released and was working as a sheet metal worker. But he was arrested again on March 12 because of what the Trump administration said was his \"prominent role\" in MS-13 and questioned about his ties to the group, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio designated as a \"foreign terrorist organization\" in February.\n\nAbrego Garcia was then transferred to a detention facility in Texas, his wife said, and then placed on the flight to El Salvador on March 15.\n\nWhile the Trump administration acknowledged that it erred in removing Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it opposed efforts to bring him back to the U.S. because of his alleged affiliation with MS-13. The Justice Department has also argued that the government does not have jurisdiction over Abrego Garcia anymore because he is in the custody of the Salvadoran government.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland held a hearing on the challenge to Abrego Garcia's removal, and ultimately ordered the administration to return him to the U.S. by 11:59 p.m. Monday. During the proceedings, a Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, conceded that Abrego Garcia \"should not have been removed,\" and said he was \"frustrated\" by a lack of information from the Trump administration as to why Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities. Reuveni was placed on administration leave in the wake of the hearing.\n\nThe judge, Paula Xinis, issued a scathing opinion Sunday that said the federal government \"confessed grievous error\" that \"shocks the conscience.\"\n\nThe Trump administration appealed the district court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and asked it to swiftly put Xinis' order requiring Abrego Garcia to be returned to the U.S. on hold.\n\nSauer then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court. His request for the high court to block Xinis' decision came just before the 4th Circuit rejected the administration's request to step into the dispute.\n\nThe solicitor general, who was confirmed to the role last week, called the district court's decision \"unprecedented and indefensible,\" and claimed the the lower courts are trying to \"seize control over foreign relations, treat the Executive Branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight.\"",

We were healthy.

    "content": "A mother and her three children who were detained last month in northern New York state and taken to Texas were being returned to New York, officials said Monday.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who had criticized the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency's decision to detain the family as \"just plain cruel,\" said she was informed of the family's return to the state by President Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan.\n\n\"I cannot imagine the trauma these kids and their mom are feeling, and I pray they will be able to heal when they return home,\" Hochul said in a statement.\n\nHochul identified the three children as a third grader and two teenagers. Advocates said the family's case had been working its way through the U.S. immigration system, and their detainment by ICE in late March prompted outcry in the New York community near the U.S.-Canada border.\n\n\"New York has been consistent: we are open to working with federal immigration enforcement to crack down on gang members or violent criminals. But I will never support cruel actions that rip kids out of school or tear families apart,\" Hochul said.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul speaks during a news conference on congestion pricing in New York City on March 21, 2025. Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe family's detainment and subsequent reaction came as the Trump administration carries out its controversial immigration crackdown throughout the country.\n\nFederal agents carried out the New York operation March 27 at a dairy farm in the town of Hounsfield, according to CBS affiliate WWNY-TV. Homan later told the station authorities were looking for a South African man who was facing federal charges of distribution of child pornography. WWNY-TV reported eight people, including the family, were detained when authorities swept the area around the farm, according to officials.\n\nNew York state Assemblyman Scott Gray, who represents the area, said in a statement Monday that the family was released after a \"follow-up with ICE witness coordinator and investigative interview with the case agent in charge of the investigation.\"\n\n\"ICE has made an independent decision to release the family while the criminal investigation continues to be conducted,\" Gray said.\n\nICE didn't immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.\n\nAn immigrant advocacy group, the New York Immigration Coalition, said the mother and her children were sent to a detention facility in Texas after they were detained. The group didn't identify the mother or her children, but its leader said their case had been working its way through the system.\n\n\"We are supposed to live in a nation of laws, but while this family was correctly navigating the immigration system and attending their immigration court hearings, they were instead taken by ICE agents and sent thousands of miles away from their home and community,\" Murad Awawdeh, the coalition's president and CEO, said in a statement in the days following their detainment.",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun redeploying staff to respond to the deadly outbreak of measles in Texas, a spokesperson said Monday, a week after steep layoffs at the agency impacted its response to the spread of the virus.\n\n\"A team of three deployed yesterday to meet with county and state officials to assess the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak. The team is meeting with officials again today,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.\n\n\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.\n\nMultiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.\n\nA handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.\n\nMcDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.\n\nThe ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.\n\nWhile dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.\n\nThere have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.\n\nDetails of the sixth outbreak have not yet been released, the spokesperson said, citing patient privacy.\n\nKennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread\n\nWhile in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.\n\nKennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.\n\nIn a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"\n\nBudesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.\n\n\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.\n\nCampbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.\n\nClarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.\n\n\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"\n\n\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.\n\nKennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.\n\n\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated. And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.\n\nThe editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.\n\n\"One child's death from measles is a tragedy not only for the family and their community but also for our nation. If we can't stop measles, really what can we do? Let's not wait for another tragedy,\" Giroir said.",

    "content": "The South Sudan foreign ministry is criticizing the revocation of U.S. visas for all its nationals, calling it unfair and saying it was based on an incident that didn't involve one of its citizens but another African national.\n\nOn Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. decided to revoke all visas for South Sudanese citizens because the country's government failed to accept the return of its citizens being removed from the U.S. in a \"timely matter.\"\n\n\"It is time for the Transitional Government of South Sudan to stop taking advantage of the United States,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"Enforcing our nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States. Every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country, including the United States, seeks to remove them.\"\n\nIt was the first such measure singling out all passport holders from a particular country since President Trump returned to the White House on Jan. 20, having campaigned on an anti-immigration platform.\n\nNo new visas will be issued, Rubio said, and \"we will be prepared to review these actions when South Sudan is in full cooperation.\"\n\nIn a statement on Monday, South Sudan's Foreign Ministry said that the deportee who was denied U.S. entry on Friday was found to be a Congolese national and he was returned to the U.S. and all supporting evidence was shared with American officials.\n\n\"The government deeply regrets that despite this history of collaboration and partnership, South Sudan now faces a broad revocation of visas based on an isolated incident involving misrepresentation by an individual who is not a South Sudanese national,\" the statement said.\n\nSouth Sudan's Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told The Associated Press on Monday that the U.S was \"attempting to find faults with the tense situation\" in the country because no sovereign nation would accept foreign deportees.\n\nThe United Nations in March warned that South Sudan was teetering on the edge of renewed civil war. The country's vice president and main opposition leader Riek Machar remains under house on charges of incitement after an armed group allied to him overrun an army camp and attacked a U.N helicopter.\n\nAround the same time, the U.S. State Department ordered the immediate departure of non-emergency personnel from the capital city of Juba, citing an increase in crime, kidnapping and armed conflict. The travel advisory level for South Sudan remains at Level 4, which means Americans should not travel to the African country.\n\nSouth Sudanese nationals had been granted Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, by the Biden administration, with the designation set to expire on May 3, 2025.\n\nThe United States grants TPS, which shields people against deportation, to foreign citizens who cannot safely return home because of war, natural disasters or other \"extraordinary\" conditions. But the Trump White House has begun overturning TPS designations, revoking protection in January from more than 600,000 Venezuelans.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many South Sudanese hold U.S. visas. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said on social media the dispute centers on one person, certified by South Sudan's Embassy in Washington, that Juba has refused to accept. That person was not named.",

    "content": "Warning, spoilers from Sunday's season three finale of \"The White Lotus\" are below.\n\nThe highly-anticipated season three finale of \"The White Lotus\" shocked fans, bringing closure to a major plot line.\n\nActor Walton Goggins told \"CBS Mornings\" that some fans got close to guessing what would happen, but no one he spoke with had the correct theory.\n\n\"All of us kind of being out in the world had to listen to, had the good fortune of listening to people tell us their version of the story out on the street and I had my fair share,\" Goggins said. \"I just listened to them the way I listened to Sam Rockwell in episode five ... without judgment and just nodding.\"\n\nThe HBO series followed the fate of the guests and staff at a luxury resort in Thailand. Goggins stars as Rick, a troubled man who is in search of answers about his father's mysterious past. His character was a major part of the season finale, which aired on Sunday.\n\nIn the finale, Rick kills Khun Jim Hollinger, the owner of the luxury resort, who was revealed to be his father only after he shot him.\n\n\"Reading it for the first time, understanding that that was where we were headed, and that's the Mount Everest that we were climbing, I knew that it was going to be a very patient slow walk to get to that point,\" Goggins said. \"I sympathize so greatly with Rick's pain because his entire life story was defined by this event that he was told by his mother.\"\n\nGoggins credited creator Mike White for how the scene developed, saying, \"the genius of Mike White in that revelation, Rick only has a couple of seconds to register it before he is being fired at.\"\n\nThe gunfire killed Rick's girlfriend, Chelsea, before he was shot and killed by hotel security guard Gaitok.\n\n\"It is the first love story in the 'White Lotus' and it was always a love story and their relationship at the beginning of this experience, that wasn't their relationship three years prior when they met,\" Goggins said.",

    "title": "Trump tariffs raise odds of U.S. recession, Wall Street economists say",
    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "The risk of a recession in the U.S. is rising following President Trump's April 2 announcement of sweeping new tariffs, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn a research note on Monday, economists with the investment bank put the odds of the economy entering a recession within the next 12 months at at 45%, up from 35% in its previous forecast. Goldman cited tightening financial conditions, consumer boycotts of U.S. goods and uncertainty over the Trump administration's economic policies, saying those factors are \"likely to depress capital spending\" by more than the bank had previously forecast.\n\n\"The combination of larger tariffs, greater policy uncertainty, declining business and consumer confidence, and messaging from the administration indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of its policies increase downside risk,\" Goldman analysts said.\n\nThe bank lowered its forecast for economic growth in 2025 to 0.5%. In 2024, the nation's gross domestic product was 2.8%.\n\n\"If most of the 'reciprocal' tariff goes into place on April 9, we expect to change our forecast to a recession,\" Goldman analysts added.\n\nOther economists have also warned that the 10% global tariff on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" duties on roughly 90 countries unveiled on April 2 are likely to slam economic growth. Also Monday, TD Securities analysts said in a report that the \"blunter than expected\" tariffs last week raised the chances of a recession to 50%.\n\nThe global tariff took effect on Saturday, while the matching tariffs are set to hit on April 9.\n\nWhat's a recession?\n\nTo be sure, It is notoriously hard to predict a recession. But there are definitive criteria for an economic downturn to be defined as recessionary.\n\nA recession is generally defined as a broad-based, persistent decline in economic activity, or more commonly two straight quarters of economic contraction. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, nonpartisan research group that dates U.S. business cycles, is responsible for determining whether or not the economy has entered a recession.\n\nTo do so, the NBER evaluates six key indicators: real personal income; non-farm payroll employment; employment as measured by the household survey; personal consumption; manufacturing and trade sales; and industrial production.\n\nAlthough policy uncertainty and waning consumer and investor confidence, among other factors, can make it feel like the economy is in a serious slump, such metrics on their own do not indicate that a recession has started.\n\nWall Street worried\n\nLeading Wall Street figures are also expressing concern that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda could lead to a reduction in economic growth.\n\nIn an annual letter to shareholders, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Monday highlighted the \"many uncertainties surrounding the new tariff policy,\" including potential retaliatory actions by foreign nations, that could put a damper on investment and growth.\n\n\"The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,\" Mr. Dimon said in the letter.\n\nNoted hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, said in a social media post on Sunday that \"by placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business and as a market to invest capital.\"\n\nAckman, an avowed supporter of President Trump, also said that the reciprocal tariffs slated to go into effect on Wednesday would amount to launching \"economic nuclear war on every country in the world.\"\n\nTrump administration officials have vigorously defended their trade polices. Speaking on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Mr. Trump \"needs to reset global trade.\"\n\n\"The factories that come build in America, we're going to protect them. They're going to be successful,\" Lutnick added. \"That's why they're going to build in America, the greatest economy in the earth. All of these companies are going to come and build here.\"\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday dismissed the notion that tariffs would cause a U.S. recession. \"I see no reason that we have to price in a recession,\" he said on NBC's Meet the Press.\n\nDespite signs that growth is slowing, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech last week that \"the economy is still in a good place.\" He pointed to recent data showing resilient job growth, while noting that tariffs are likely to boost consumer prices.",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "What to know about Trump's latest tariff threat against China as markets have volatile day\n\nPresident Trump has vehemently defended the sweeping tariffs unveiled by his administration on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\" last week, even as they threaten to spark a global trade war and have sent stock markets tumbling around the world.\n\nIn the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and \"will likely increase inflation.\"\n\nMr. Trump on April 2 announced a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.\n\nCBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the CBS News app on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.\n\nIn addition to the baseline tax, Mr. Trump had said China would face a \"reciprocal\" levy of 34%, and in response to Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, the president has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on China if it does not lift those duties by Tuesday.\n\nAs markets fall, and with his reciprocal import duties set to take effect on Wednesday, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.\n\nNo pause in tariffs\n\nDuring a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump confirmed on Monday that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs. When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said \"they both can be true.\"\n\n\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"\n\nThe president also said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.\n\n\"Hang tough\"\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"\n\n\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.\n\n\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\n\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"\n\nMr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on Sunday on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.\n\nAddressing the U.S. market plunge that followed his April 2 announcement — Wall Street's worst in five years — and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"\n\n\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.\n\nHe also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.\n\n\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"\n\nEchoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday. Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"\n\n\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"\n\n\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"\n\nIn the hour before trading opened on Wall Street Monday, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.\n\n\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"\n\nHe posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.\n\nAdditional tariffs on China\n\nMr. Trump vowed on Monday to raise duties imposed on China to 50% beginning Wednesday, after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.\n\nOn Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase by Tuesday or face higher costs.\n\n\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

    "title": "Israel walks back its account of Gaza medic killings after video surfaces of attack",
    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "The Israeli military backtracked on its account of the killing of 15 Palestinian medics by its forces last month after phone video appeared to contradict its claims that their vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire on them in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe military initially said it opened fire because the vehicles were \"advancing suspiciously\" on nearby troops without headlights or emergency signals. An Israeli military official, speaking late Saturday on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said that account was \"mistaken.\"\n\nThe footage shows the Red Crescent and Civil Defense teams driving slowly with their emergency vehicles' lights flashing, logos visible, as they pulled up to help an ambulance that had come under fire earlier. The teams do not appear to be acting unusually or in a threatening manner as three medics emerge and head toward the stricken ambulance.\n\nTheir vehicles immediately come under a barrage of gunfire, which goes on for more than five minutes with brief pauses. The owner of the phone can be heard praying.\n\n\"Forgive me, mother. This is the path I chose, mother, to help people,\" he cries, his voice weak.\n\nEight Red Crescent personnel, six Civil Defense workers and a U.N. staffer were killed in the shooting before dawn on March 23 by Israeli troops conducting operations in Tel al-Sultan, a district of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Troops then bulldozed over the bodies along with their mangled vehicles, burying them in a mass grave. U.N. and rescue workers were only able to reach the site a week later to dig out the bodies.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent Society's vice president, Marwan Jilani, said the phone with the footage was found in the pocket of one of its slain staffers. The Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations distributed the video to the U.N. Security Council. The Associated Press obtained the video from a U.N. diplomat on condition of anonymity because it has not been made public.\n\nOne paramedic who survived, Munzer Abed, confirmed the veracity of the video to the AP. Two block-shaped concrete structures visible in the video are also seen in a U.N. video released Sunday showing the recovery of the bodies from the site — a sign they are in the same location.\n\nAsked about the video, the Israeli military said Saturday that the incident was \"under thorough examination.\"\n\nThe head of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, Younes Al-Khatib, called for an independent investigation. \"We don't trust any of the army investigations,\" he told a briefing at the U.N. on Friday.\n\nOne medic, Assaad al-Nassasra, is still missing, the Red Crescent says. Abed said he saw al-Nassasra being led away blindfolded by Israeli troops. Al-Khatib said the organization has asked the military where it is holding the staffer.\n\nAl-Khatib said the slain men had been \"targeted at close range\" and that a forensic autopsy report would be released soon.\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas of moving and hiding its fighters inside ambulances and emergency vehicles, as well as in hospitals and other civilian infrastructure, arguing that justifies strikes on them. Medical personnel largely deny the accusations.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed more than 150 emergency responders from the Red Crescent and Civil Defense, most of them while on duty, as well as over 1,000 health workers, according to the U.N. The Israeli military rarely investigates such incidents.\n\nAmbulances started heading to Tel al-Sultan at around 3:50 a.m. on March 23, responding to reports of wounded, Jilani said. The first ambulance returned safely with at least one casualty, he said. But, he said, subsequent ambulances came under fire.\n\nHis hands trembling, Abed told the AP on Saturday that as his ambulance entered the area, its siren lights were on. \"All of a sudden, I am telling you, there was direct shooting at us,\" so intense that the vehicle ground to a stop, he said.\n\nA 10-year veteran of the Red Crescent, Abed said he was sitting in the back seat and ducked to the floor. He said he could hear nothing from his two colleagues in the front seat — the only others in the vehicle. They appear to have been killed instantly.\n\nIsraeli troops, some with night goggles, dragged Abed out of the ambulance and onto the ground, he said. They made him strip to his underwear, beat him all over his body with their rifle butts, then tied his hands behind his back, he said.\n\nThey interrogated him, asking him about his paramedic training and how many people were in the ambulance with him, he said. One soldier pressed the muzzle of his automatic rifle into his neck. Another pressed his knife blade into Abed's palm, almost cutting it, until a third soldier pulled them away and warned Abed, \"They're crazy.\"\n\nAbed said he witnessed them opening fire on the next vehicles to arrive. Soldiers forced him onto his stomach and pressed a gun into his back, he said, and amid the shooting in the darkness, so he could only see two Civil Defense vehicles.\n\nThe phone video shows a rescue convoy of Red Crescent and Civil Defense vehicles that was sent out after contact was lost with the stricken ambulance. Taken from the dashboard of one vehicle, it shows several ambulances and a fire truck moving down a road through a barren area in the darkness. The emergency lights on their roofs are flashing the entire way.\n\nThey arrive at an ambulance on the side of the road and stop next to it, their lights still flashing. No Israeli troops are visible.\n\n\"Lord, let them be OK,\" a man in the car says. Then he cries out, \"They're tossed around on the ground!\" — apparently referring to bodies. Three men in orange Civil Defense clothing can be seen getting out of the vehicles and walking toward the stopped ambulance.\n\nA shot rings out and one of the men appears to fall. Gunfire erupts.\n\nThe man holding the phone appears to scramble out of the car and onto the ground, but the screen goes black, though the audio continues. The gunfire goes on for nearly five and a half minutes, with long, heavy barrages followed by silences punctuated by individual shots and shouts and screams.\n\nThroughout, the man with the phone says over and over, \"There is no God but God and Muhammad is God's prophet\" — the profession of faith that Muslims say when they fear they are about to die. Near the end of the six-minute, 40-second video, voices can be heard shouting in Hebrew. \"The Jews are coming,\" the man said, referring to Israeli soldiers, before the video cuts off.\n\nThe Israeli military official asserted there was \"no mistreatment,\" and said he didn't know why the vehicles had been buried. He had no information about the medic who remained missing.\n\nThe Israeli military says that after the shooting, troops determined they had killed a Hamas figure named Mohammed Amin Shobaki and eight other militants. However, none of the 15 slain medics has that name, and no other bodies are known to have been found at the site.\n\nThe military has not said what happened to Shobaki's body or released the names of the other alleged militants. The Israeli military official said Israel was \"working to bring evidence\" that Hamas operatives were killed.\n\nJonathan Whittall, interim head in Gaza of the U.N. humanitarian office OCHA, dismissed allegations that the slain medics were Hamas militants, saying staff had worked with the same medics previously in evacuating patients from hospitals and other tasks.\n\n\"These are paramedic crews that I personally have met before,\" he said. \"They were buried in their uniforms with their gloves on. They were ready to save lives.\"",

    "content": "President Trump on Monday said the U.S. will apply an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if the Asian nation doesn't withdraw its plan to impose a retaliatory 34% import fee on American products.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social app, Mr. Trump said that \"any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set.\"\n\nHe added, \"Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.\"\n\nCBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the CBS News app on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.\n\nOn April 2, Mr. Trump announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations, adding to a 10% global tax applied to all products shipped to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to members of the European Union.\n\nIn response to Mr. Trump's imposition of a 34% tariff on Chinese imports, which is set to go into effect on April 9, Beijing last week announced it would add a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10.\n\nIf Mr. Trump implements his plans, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of 20% tariffs aimed at spurring China to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week.\n\nLast year, the U.S. imported about $439 billion worth of goods from China, ranging from Apple iPhones to clothing, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nExcluding the threat of an added 50% levy on Chinese imports, American consumers could face higher costs of about $3,789 per year due to the previously announced tariffs, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.\n\nConsumers generally bear the brunt of tariffs because importers like Walmart, which must pay the import duties when they accept shipments from other nations, typically seek to spread all or most of the cost through higher price tags on imported goods. Because of those dynamics, many economists say inflation is likely to reignite this year.\n\nWall Street has been spooked by Mr. Trump's growing trade war, with economists warning that the conflict could slam economic growth and even potentially trigger a recession.\n\nIn his social media post threatening to add new tariffs to China, Mr. Trump added that he plans to start negotiations with other nations \"immediately.\"\n\nIn a separate Truth Social post on Monday, Mr. Trump also said he spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to start trade negotiations. He complained, \"they have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade\" and \"they don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs.\"\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, saying they would have to make structural changes to their tax and regulatory codes.\n\n\"Let's take Vietnam,\" he said on CNBC. \"When they come to us and say, 'We'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters.\"\n\ncontributed to this report.",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Dr. Samer Attar is an orthopedic surgeon in Chicago, a professor of surgery at Northwestern, and recently, among the brave volunteers fighting for life in the war in Gaza.\n\nGaza is 25 miles long and home to two million Palestinians, descendants of those displaced in the 1948 creation of Israel. Gaza is ruled by a terrorist group called Hamas. And in 2023, Hamas attacked Israel — an atrocity—that, Israel says, killed 1,200 civilians, including 40 children, and captured 251. Israel's war to free its hostages and defeat Hamas has killed an estimated 50,000 Palestinians, 15,000 of them children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. The U.N. says 92% of Gaza housing has been damaged. Last week on 60 Minutes, Lesley Stahl reported on the trauma and torture suffered by Israeli hostages.\n\nTonight, we have the story of the desperate fight to save Gaza's civilians through the charity of nations and the mercy of volunteers like Samer Attar.\n\nThat's Dr. Attar battling a stalled heart. The patient is a paramedic. An explosion near his ambulance killed his partner. But it's not just the paramedics, health care itself is dying in Gaza, with 33 hospitals damaged and the rest starved of supplies.\n\nDr. Samer Attar: Imagine 50 people showing up all at once, and 15 of them are dead on arrival. And they're all trying to get into the emergency room, and there's no place to step. And there's not enough beds, so you're working and resuscitating and operating on patients on floors smeared with dirt and blood. And you'd see just little kids shredded and twisted, their insides fallin' out-- dismembered, missin' arms and legs. I remember one little girl just pounding her fists on the floor, just refusing to believe that her mom was dead-- but they had to just forcefully pull her away to make room for --for incoming wounded because the pace of the wounded just doesn't stop. They keep coming.\n\nScott Pelley: When these patients come into the emergency room, what is it that you don't have?\n\nDr. Samer Attar: There's no sterility. Anesthesia is kind of a luxury sometimes. We had two kids come in, two young kids involved in an explosion. One was missing skin over half of his body. The other one, we did an emergency amputation of his leg. Both could've been saved. They were both brothers. But I remember the anesthesia doctor on the phone begging the blood bank for blood. And there's only so much blood to give, and the blood bank said, \"Sorry, we don't have any more to give you. We just can't give you any more.\" And it was a Palestinian doctor. He collapsed to the ground crying, and he said he can't take it anymore because he's lost so many kids for something as simple as a blood transfusion. And that-- that kid just-- we just sat back and helplessly watched him die on the operating room table. And his brother was the same story. He could've been saved, but we didn't have blood. And he died the next day.\n\nDr. Samer Attar 60 Minutes\n\nScott Pelley: When anesthesia is a luxury, what do you do?\n\nDr. Samer Attar: You say you're sorry a lot. It's not something you ever really wanna be involved in.\n\nSamer Attar is 49. His parents were Syrian doctors who immigrated to the U.S. in the '60s.\n\nScott Pelley (2016): How many trips in does this make for you?\n\nDr. Samer Attar (2016): This is number four.\n\nWe met Dr. Attar in 2016 as he volunteered in the Syrian war. He's also worked in Ukraine. This was his fifth mission to Gaza—on rotations that last two or three weeks.\n\nDr. Samer Attar: The bombs land so close, you feel the hospital shaking. At times the fighting and conflict is so intense you feel like the hospital will-- is gonna collapse on top of you. And there have been instances of hospitals that were attacked, that were invaded. So, there's really no safe space.\n\nGaza medical facilities and ambulances have been attacked 670 times, according to the U.N. But the Israeli military says Hamas uses hospitals for shelter and arsenals. Dr. Attar has worked in five Gaza hospitals.\n\nScott Pelley: The Israelis would tell you that they are attacking these facilities, when they do, because Hamas is using them as command-and-control centers.\n\nDr. Samer Attar: I just saw doctors and nurses and patients. I didn't see any tunnels. I didn't see any uniformed Hamas soldiers. I didn't see any hostages. If I did, I woulda said and done somethin' about it. But I didn't.\n\nAs for the paramedic we saw earlier, Dr. Attar did restart his heart but he doesn't know if the man lived. The doctor can't keep up with so many wounded.\n\nScott Pelley: It occurs to me that you have all of these patients in your memory, and you never find out what happened to them.\n\nDr. Samer Attar: Yeah. I remember-- I remember all of them.\n\nA few of his patients are evacuated. Israel has permitted a total of about 7,000 through its blockade. More than 300 children were medevaced by the Gulf state of Qatar—in an act of charity that saw the patients escape the poorest place on earth for one of the richest. Qatar's $8 billion Sidra hospital opened a ward for the Gaza children. Dr. Mansour Ali is head of surgery.\n\nDr. Mansour Ali 60 Minutes\n\nScott Pelley: How important was it to some of these patients to get out of Gaza?\n\nDr. Mansour Ali: Some of these patient is life and death situation because if they stayed there-- they would have died from complication of their injuries from wound infection—and septic shocks and thing, they could have died.\n\nOne of those saved is 2-year-old Sanad. Sanad's grandmother, Marwa al-Arabi told us that their neighborhood was bombed one year ago. Sanad's face and tongue were torn apart. He lost one arm.\n\nMarwa al-Arabi (speaking Arabic/Pelley translation): Eleven people were killed, SHE TOLD US, including my uncle, my brother-in-law, and my daughter's children. All my children were injured.\n\nScott Pelley: The first time that you saw Sanad after he was injured, what did you see?\n\nMarwa al-Arabi (speaking Arabic/Pelley translation): I was hysterical. The sight was so horrifying. I didn't think he would survive. I thought he was taking his last breath.\n\nSanad and the others have been recovering in Qatar about a year.\n\nScott Pelley: How many of you lost your home?\n\n(hands raised)\n\nScott Pelley: Almost all of you.\n\nScott Pelley: How many of you lost one of your parents?\n\nThis girl suffered a traumatic head injury, repaired with a plate in her skull.\n\nGirl (speaking Arabic/Pelley translation): They bombed my grandfather's house. SHE TOLD US. I was about to leave the house when a piece of shrapnel hit my head. Two of my brothers were killed along with my grandfather and grandmother.\n\nFifteen-year-old Lama told us that she was unconscious in a Gaza hospital for a week.\n\nLama (speaking Arabic/Pelley translation): I didn't know what had happened, SHE SAID. I learned my leg was amputated. It was a month before I learned that my sister and brother had been killed.\n\nMany of the children are patients of Dr. Lisa Thornton, chief of pediatric rehabilitation at Sidra.\n\nDr. Lisa Thornton: This was my first time ever having any experience with war trauma. I'm from Chicago. I've seen a lotta trauma-- a lot of violent trauma, but I had never seen anything like this.\n\nScott Pelley: What can you do to rehabilitate them?\n\nDr. Lisa Thornton: Our goal is to get them back to childhood. And really, you know, the primary occupation of childhood is play. So, we want to be able to get these kids back to being able to play.\n\nDr. Lisa Thornton with Sanad 60 Minutes\n\nScott Pelley: But if you have a child with multiple amputations, how can you achieve that?\n\nDr. Lisa Thornton: First of all, we're blessed that children are resilient, right? So, if they're not in pain, and they can move, they often figure it out. I had one young man who, sadly, both of his arms were blown off, so he had amputations here at the shoulders, and he was nine years old. And within a few weeks, he was using his feet.\n\nScott Pelley: What has he been able to do with his feet?\n\nDr. Lisa Thornton: Well, he can feed himself. He can write a little bit, 'cause you can hold a pen with your toes. It's pretty amazing.\n\nThis is that young man steering a scooter—and remembering the joy of play.\n\nScott Pelley: What gives you hope?\n\nDr. Lisa Thornton: Well, the kids. You know, the children give me hope. I mean, they're playful, and they're energetic, and they're surviving. I believe that the human spirit is incredible, and the spirit of children is more than any of us have as adults.\n\nScott Pelley: For every child that is evacuated from Gaza, how many are left behind who need that kind of care?\n\nDr. Samer Attar: Thousands. Thousands.\n\nThose were the patients in the mind of Samer Attar when we met in qatar. He told us many that he recalls were not wounded at all-- but starving—because of the blockade.\n\nDr. Samer Attar: I remember a kid called Karem. He was suffering from significant malnutrition. There just wasn't enough food and water where his mom was at, and he was in the ICU. And his mom asked me to come meet him. And-- I started talking to her and then the nurses told me that Karem had been dead for over an hour. Mom just refused to let the nurses take away his body. And she kept showing me videos of what he used to look like, and how he was so playful, and how he was so kind. And she just couldn't believe that because they didn't have enough food and water, he didn't make it.\n\nIsrael's prime minister has said his country ensures \"humanitarian assistance reaches those in need…\" But the U.N. says Gaza is at risk of famine and two million are homeless. Thousands have protested in Gaza calling for the end of the Hamas regime.\n\nScott Pelley: There's a lot of suffering.\n\nDr. Samer Attar: Yeah, I can't stop bombs. I can't rescue hostages. I can't solve this crisis. I can't repair the world. But I can stand next to you. I can live amongst you. I can share your grief. I can feel your fear. I can serve your community. I can bear witness to your suffering. And then just make some noise about it. And it's not much, but it beats burying your head in hatred and violence and ignorance.\n\nThis violence began with the attack on Israel. In a two-month ceasefire earlier this year, many Israeli hostages were released. But Israel believes 24 living hostages remain. In our story last week, former hostages told Lesley Stahl of torture. Yarden Bibas spoke of Hamas terrorists murdering his wife and two children in cold blood. Now, Israel is pressing its military campaign and has cut off nearly all food and humanitarian aid. In the 19th month of suffering, there is no end in sight.\n\nProduced by Nicole Young. Field producers, Selin Özdemir, Tariq Shaweesh. Associate producer, Kristin Steve.

    "content": "Days of unrelenting heavy rain and storms killed at least 24 people across seven states, as some rivers rose to near-record levels and inundated towns in already saturated areas of the South and parts of the Midwest.\n\nThe deaths since the storms began on Wednesday included 10 in Tennessee, which saw powerful tornadoes spring up from an initial wave of storms last week and continued to face heavy flooding through the weekend. Flooding killed at least five more in Kentucky — including a 9-year-old boy swept away Friday on his way to school, and a 74-year-old whose body was found Saturday inside a submerged vehicle, authorities said.\n\nThree deaths were confirmed in Missouri. Officials in Arkansas and Georgia have so far confirmed two deaths each due to the storms. Indiana and Mississippi both reported at least one death. The fatalities included a 5-year-old boy in Arkansas who died after a tree fell on his family's home, and a 16-year-old volunteer Missouri firefighter killed in a crash while seeking to rescue people caught in the storm, police said.\n\nCities have ordered evacuations as rescue crews in inflatable boats checked on residents in Kentucky and Tennessee, while utilities shut off power and gas in areas from Texas to Ohio. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said it is working with local and federal partners to evaluate storm damages and decide whether they meet the criteria for a major federal disaster declaration. The agency has advised residents to report any damages to their local emergency management offices.\n\n\"As long as I've been alive — and I'm 52 — this is the worst I've ever seen it,\" said Wendy Quire, the general manager at the Brown Barrel restaurant in downtown Frankfort, Kentucky, the state capital built around the swollen Kentucky River.\n\n\"The rain just won't stop,\" Quire said Sunday. \"It's been nonstop for days and days.\"\n\nOfficials diverted traffic and turned off utilities to businesses in the city as the river was expected to crest above 49 feet Monday at a record-setting level, said Frankfort Mayor Layne Wilkerson. The city's flood wall system is designed to withstand 51 feet of water.\n\nA boy looks out from a parking garage as two people take a boat into the floodwaters on April 6, 2025 in Frankfort, Kentucky. Michael Swensen / Getty Images\n\nFor many, there was a sense of dread that the worst was still to come.\n\n\"This flooding is an act of God,\" said Kevin Gordon, a front desk clerk at the Ashbrook Hotel in downtown Frankfort. The hotel was offering discounted stays to affected locals.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned Sunday that dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach a \"major flood stage,\" with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible.\n\nIn north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth and Butler, towns near the bend of the rising Licking River. Thirty years ago, the river reached a record 50 feet, resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.\n\nThe storms come after the Trump administration cut jobs at NWS forecast offices, leaving half of them with vacancy rates of about 20%, or double the level of a decade ago.\n\nForecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong winds and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf.\n\nThe NWS said 5.06 inches of rain fell Saturday in Jonesboro, Arkansas - making it the wettest day ever recorded in April in the city. Memphis, Tennessee, received 14 inches of rain from Wednesday to Sunday, the NWS said.\n\nRives, a northwestern Tennessee town of about 200 people, was almost entirely underwater after the Obion River overflowed.\n\nDomanic Scott went to check on his father in Rives after not hearing from him in a house where water reached the doorstep.\n\n\"It's the first house we've ever paid off. The insurance companies around here won't give flood insurance to anyone who lives in Rives because we're too close to the river and the levees. So if we lose it, we're kind of screwed without a house,\" Scott said.\n\nIn Dyersburg, Tennessee, dozens of people arrived over the weekend at a storm shelter near a public school clutching blankets, pillows and other necessities. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage.\n\nAmong them was George Manns, 77, who said he was in his apartment when he heard a tornado warning and decided to head to the shelter. Just days earlier the city was hit by a tornado that caused millions of dollars in damage.\n\n\"I grabbed all my stuff and came here,\" said Mann, who brought a folding chair, two bags of toiletries, laptops, iPads and medications: \"I don't leave them in my apartment in case my apartment is destroyed.\"\n\nFor others, grabbing the essentials also meant taking a closer look at the liquor cabinet.\n\nIn Frankfort, with water rising up to his window sills, resident Bill Jones fled his home in a boat, which he loaded with several boxes of bottles of bourbon.",

    "content": "What to know about Trump's latest tariff threat against China as markets have volatile day\n\nPresident Trump has vehemently defended the sweeping tariffs unveiled by his administration on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\" last week, even as they threaten to spark a global trade war and have sent stock markets tumbling around the world.\n\nIn the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and \"will likely increase inflation.\"\n\nMr. Trump on April 2 announced a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.\n\nCBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the CBS News app on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.\n\nIn addition to the baseline tax, Mr. Trump had said China would face a \"reciprocal\" levy of 34%, and in response to Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, the president has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on China if it does not lift those duties by Tuesday.\n\nAs markets fall, and with his reciprocal import duties set to take effect on Wednesday, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.\n\nNo pause in tariffs\n\nDuring a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump confirmed on Monday that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs. When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said \"they both can be true.\"\n\n\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"\n\nThe president also said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.\n\n\"Hang tough\"\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"\n\n\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.\n\n\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\n\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"\n\nMr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on Sunday on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.\n\nAddressing the U.S. market plunge that followed his April 2 announcement — Wall Street's worst in five years — and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"\n\n\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.\n\nHe also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.\n\n\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"\n\nEchoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday. Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"\n\n\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"\n\n\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"\n\nIn the hour before trading opened on Wall Street Monday, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.\n\n\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"\n\nHe posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.\n\nAdditional tariffs on China\n\nMr. Trump vowed on Monday to raise duties imposed on China to 50% beginning Wednesday, after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.\n\nOn Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase by Tuesday or face higher costs.\n\n\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

Goldman Sachs economists cited the barrage of levies on Monday in raising the odds of a recession to 45%.\n\n\"The combination of larger tariffs, greater policy uncertainty, declining business and consumer confidence, and messaging from the administration indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of its policies increase downside risk,\" Goldman analysts said in a report.\n\nStocks plummeted last week after Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% global duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries. The new trade measures sent markets into a tailspin, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recording their biggest two-day drop since March 2020.\n\nOverseas stock markets also suffered steep losses Monday, continuing their skid from last week. Hong Kong's Hang Seng plunged 13.2% — its steepest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, while Taiwan's Taiex fell 9.7%, its heaviest loss on record. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index tumbled 7.8%, the Shanghai Composite index sank 7.3%, South Korea's Kospi dropped 5.6% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined 4.2%.\n\nIn Europe, Germany's DAX index ended the day down 4.8%, Paris' CAC 40 shed 4.8%, and Britain's FTSE 100 lost 4.4%.\n\n\"The near-term future of equity prices depends heavily on Donald Trump's whims,\" Thomas Mathews, head of Asia Pacific markets at Capital Economics, said in a note to investors. \"If he blinks in the face of market moves and/or decides he's received enough concessions, he could lift some tariffs and sentiment might turn very quickly.\"\n\ncontributed to this report.",

    "content": "Idaho video store closes after 30 years, but one customer's routine lives on\n\nAt the last remaining video store in Pocatello, Idaho, the curtains have closed after more than 30 years, but owner David Kraning found a way to keep a crucial service going for his most loyal customer.\n\nChristina Cavanaugh, who has Down syndrome and is mostly non-verbal, has rented a movie from The Video Stop every day for the past 20 years, often the same titles at the same time each afternoon.\n\n\"She doesn't ask for very much, she asks for very little, so when she does express herself, I try and accommodate her,\" said Toni Cavanaugh, Christina's mother.\n\nTo keep a cherished routine alive, Pocatello store owner David Kraning created \"Christina's Corner\" — a personal movie section built just for his most loyal customer. CBS News\n\nThough Christina's family owns most of the movies she rents, the routine of visiting the store and checking out films is essential to her well-being.\n\n\"She'll only watch them if they're from the video store,\" Toni explained with a laugh. \"I think it's comforting.\"\n\nWhen financial realities forced Kraning to close The Video Stop, he faced a dilemma about how to break the news to Christina.\n\n\"Last year, just looking at the financials, it wasn't sustainable to try and keep the video store going,\" Kraning said. \"This was one of my first jobs and I remember back in high school, her bringing her daughter in, getting the movies.\"\n\nEven though her family owns most of the movies, Christina Cavanaugh will only watch them if they're rented from the local video store. CBS News\n\nInstead of simply shutting down, Kraning, who also owns the convenience store next door, created \"Christina's Corner\" — a special section with shelving and a display of DVDs designed to look like the video store experience she was accustomed to.\n\n\"That somebody would do something so kind, for her specifically like that — he wasn't thinking about anything else except her. That's huge,\" said Toni.\n\nChristina still arrives around 3:30 p.m. daily, selects a movie from Christina's Corner, and checks it out herself at the register. Before leaving, she gives a gesture that powerfully communicates her gratitude.\n\nToni says Pocatello has been the ideal community for raising Christina.\n\n\"The people here treat her like family — especially Dave and his team, who continue to prioritize her needs despite business challenges,\" she said.\n\nDavid Begnaud loves uncovering the heart of every story and will continue to do so, highlighting everyday heroes and proving that there is good news in the news with his exclusive \"CBS Mornings\" series \"Beg-Knows America.\" Every Monday, get ready for moments that will make you smile or even shed a tear.

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Opening statements began Monday in the Arizona trial of \"Doomsday mom\" Lori Vallow Daybell, the mother who was sentenced to life in prison in Idaho for killing her children in 2019.\n\nIn Arizona, Vallow Daybell has been indicted of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow.\n\nShe has pleaded not guilty to the charge and is representing herself at the trial.\n\n\"I'm fighting for my life here,\" Vallow Daybell told CBS affiliate AZFamily's True Crime Arizona correspondent Briana Whitney in a jailhouse interview ahead of opening statements.\n\nJury selection in the Arizona case began on Monday, March 31. About 200 potential jurors were screened, AZFamily reported, but many were ruled out by Vallow Daybell and prosecutors because they knew about the case. Sixteen jurors, including four alternates, were chosen. The jury is made up of 13 men and three women, AZFamily reported.\n\nAZFamily has been permitted by the judge to stream the trial on a 30-minute delay. The trial is expected to last until mid-May at the latest.\n\nWhat did Lori Vallow Daybell do?\n\nLori Vallow Daybell was sentenced to life in prison without parole in the killings of her children, Tylee Ryan and Joshua Jaxon \"JJ\" Vallow. Tylee was Vallow Daybell's child from a previous relationship. She and Charles Vallow adopted JJ in 2012.\n\nIn 2018, Vallow Daybell met doomsday fiction author Chad Daybell. A year later, she separated from Vallow and began a relationship with Daybell.\n\nThe couple held apocalyptic religious beliefs that prosecutors claimed were used to justify the killings of Tylee, JJ and Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell.\n\n7-year-old Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow and 16-year-old Tylee Ryan. Kauai Police\n\nTylee and JJ disappeared within two weeks of each other in September 2019. In October 2019, Tammy Daybell was found dead in her bed. A coroner said her death initially appeared to be due to natural causes, but an autopsy wasn't conducted before her body was buried. Two weeks later, in November 2019, Daybell and Vallow Daybell were married in Hawaii.\n\nThe remains of Tammy Daybell were exhumed in December 2019, an autopsy was performed and her cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation. In February 2020, Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii for ignoring a police order to produce her children, who had been reported missing by their grandparents. Several months later, in June 2020, the bodies of Tylee and JJ were found on a property owned by Chad Daybell.\n\nDaybell and Vallow Daybell were each charged in the deaths of Tammy Daybell, Tylee and JJ. In separate trials, they were each found guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the children's deaths. Vallow Daybell was also convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in Tammy Daybell's death and of theft charges related to financial payments sent to her children.\n\nDaybell was found guilty of murder in Tammy Daybell's death, as well as several other related charges. He has been sentenced to death.\n\nLori Vallow Daybell glances at the camera during her hearing in Rexburg, Idaho, on March 6, 2020. John Roark/The Idaho Post-Register via AP\n\nWhat was Lori Vallow Daybell's relationship with Charles Vallow?\n\nLori Vallow Daybell and Charles Vallow were married from 2006 to 2019.\n\nIn early 2019, Vallow became very worried about his wife. He went to the police with his concerns, telling them that Vallow Daybell believed she was a \"god\" who was preparing for the end of days.\n\n\"She threatened me, murder me, kill me,\" he told police in a conversation recorded on video, according to \"48 Hours.\"\n\nVallow filed for divorce in February 2019. In the filing, he said that Vallow Daybell had threatened to murder him. He also expressed fears for JJ and Tylee's safety.\n\nLori and Charles Vallow married in 2006. Kay Woodcock\n\nHow did Charles Vallow die?\n\nCharles Vallow was shot and killed by Lori Vallow Daybell's brother, Alexander Lamar Cox, on July 11, 2019.\n\nVallow had gone to the home where Vallow Daybell was living with Cox and the two children after their separation to pick up JJ. The home was in Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nIn police video, Tylee said that she heard Vallow and Cox arguing.\n\n\"Honestly, it feels, it feels like 2 seconds, and 40 minutes at the same time. ... I just kind of heard yelling over everything. I don't know, I kind of just do that when everything is, like, really loud, I kind of just tune what people are saying out,\" she told detectives.\n\nCox told police that he had killed Vallow in self-defense. He was not arrested.\n\nCox's wife, Zulema Pastenes, testified that Daybell and Vallow Daybell had convinced him that his divine mission was to protect his sister. Pastenes said that Cox told her he feared the pair would make him their \"fall guy.\" That conversation, Pastenes said, occurred a day before Cox's sudden death in December 2019. Medical examiners said he died of a pulmonary blood clot.\n\nWhat to know about the latest charges\n\nLori Vallow Daybell has been charged with conspiring with Alex Cox to kill Charles Vallow. The trial is taking place in Phoenix, Arizona, where Vallow died.\n\nApril Raymond told \"48 Hours\" that Vallow Daybell, her former friend, told her she believed Vallow was already dead and had a demon living inside him. She would later make similar comments about her children.\n\nIn December 2024, a judge ruled that Vallow Daybell was mentally fit to stand trial. She will be able to wear civilian clothes and will not be shackled, but will have to wear a shock vest, AZFamily said.\n\nComplicating the trial is Vallow Daybell's decision to represent herself. Vallow Daybell said that she has studied case law during her time in prison. She also said she has experience in court that will help her represent herself.\n\n\"My intention is to say the things that I would say for myself,\" Vallow Daybell said in the jailhouse interview with Whitney.\n\nShe said her attorneys in Idaho did not always say what she wanted them to and \"sometimes you just have to be able to do it for yourself.\"\n\nVallow Daybell said she hadn't decided yet if she would testify at the trial.\n\n\"We're going to see how it goes,\" she said.\n\nThe logistics of preparing for the case have been a challenge, Vallow Daybell said. At a hearing on March 18 she said it was difficult for her to communicate with her legal team while in jail.\n\n\"Where I am at the jail, the communication is very difficult for me to get ahold of my investigator, get ahold of my paralegal. I'm 23 hours a day locked down. If I don't have Wi-Fi, I don't have a phone, if I don't have battery, I don't have a phone,\" she said.\n\nIf found guilty, Vallow faces life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years. She is already serving multiple life sentences with no possibility of parole after the convictions in Idaho.\n\nThis trial is not the last of her legal troubles. Vallow Daybell also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit murder for the attempted shooting of her niece's ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. Boudreaux was shot at in 2019 while driving near his home but was unhurt. Prosecutors say Cox carried out the shooting but missed his target. Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n\nLori Vallow, in a booking photo from Maricopa County, Arizona. Maricopa County Sheriff's Office\n\nLori Vallow Daybell's \"Dateline\" interview\n\nIn a jailhouse interview with NBC's \"Dateline,\" which aired in March, Vallow Daybell made multiple baseless claims. She was often combative toward correspondent Keith Morrison as she claimed to be innocent of all charges.\n\nShe said she \"was not there\" when JJ and Tylee were killed and was not involved in Tammy Daybell's death. She tried to blame JJ's death on Tylee, Morrison said, but investigators have said Tylee died before JJ.\n\n\"She came in and she had her own agenda,\" Morrison said of Vallow Daybell ahead of the airing of the \"Dateline\" episode. \"She wanted to be the aggressor.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Vallow Daybell also briefly discussed how she would serve as her own attorney in the Charles Vallow case. She called the process \"great\" but a \"difficult thing to do.\"\n\ncontributed to this report.",

    "title": "Jamie Dimon, major Wall Street figures issue warnings about Trump's tariffs",
    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is speaking out President Trump's sweeping tariffs, cautioning the levies could lead to higher inflation and slow the U.S. economy. Other Wall Street leaders are also starting to express tariff-related concerns, including billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.\n\nWhile many corporate leaders have been notably silent around Mr. Trump's trade policies, Wall Street executives this week spoke critically of the Trump administration's range of tariffs, some of which went into effect over the weekend, following the loss of trillions of value in last week's stock market rout.\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders Monday, Dimon warned that Mr. Trump's \"tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.\" Dimon's remarks come after he said in January that Americans should \"get over\" concerns about the effects of tariffs.\n\nDimon, who heads the largest U.S. bank, added in his shareholder letter that while the economy is weakening, stock market \"prices remain relatively high.\" While Dimon did not criticize Mr. Trump directly, he noted that the tariffs would have \"short-term effects\" including anticipated higher prices on both domestic and imported goods.\n\nSuch conditions could lead to what's known as stagflation — a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" — which describes economic periods when growth slows even as prices remain painfully high. Inflation typically eases when the economy contracts.\n\n\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" Dimon said.\n\nHe said potential retaliatory actions by other nations are weighing on confidence, and said unequivocally that the \"quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.\"\n\n\"Economic nuclear war\"\n\nA chorus of other high-profile Wall Street executives echoed Dimon's remarks, with some sharply criticizing the White House's recent tariff actions. Many corporate leaders have thus far been reluctant to openly criticize the Trump Administration's agenda.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, said on X Sunday that \"by placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"\n\nAckman said that the reciprocal tariffs slated to go into effect on dozens of countries April 9 would be tantamount launching \"economic nuclear war on every country in the world.\"\n\nAs a result, \"business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,\" he said.\n\nHe took aim at Mr. Trump directly, saying \"The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe\" and that if he doesn't pause the tariffs from going into effect, the U.S. is headed for a \"self-induced, economic nuclear winter.\"\n\nTariff \"errors\"\n\nOther prominent investors that are chiming in include billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of Duquesne Family Office, who wrote in a social media post, \"I do not support tariffs exceeding 10%.\"\n\nAnd hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, CEO of Third Point, on X posted an American Enterprise Institute analysis of Mr. Trump's tariff formula, which he said highlighted its \"conceptual as well as practical errors.\"\n\n\"It will be a test of the administration's judgment versus ideology how they resolve this over the weekend or coming days,\" Loeb wrote.",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "What to know about Trump's crackdown on foreign student visas\n\nThe United States is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and blocking new arrivals, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Saturday, complaining the African nation is not accepting its nationals expelled from the U.S.\n\nThe State Department \"is taking actions to revoke all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders and prevent further issuance to prevent entry,\" Rubio said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first such measure singling out all passport holders from a particular country since President Trump returned to the White House on Jan. 20, having campaigned on an anti-immigration platform.\n\nRubio accused the transitional government in Juba of \"taking advantage of the United States,\" saying that \"every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country...seeks to remove them.\"\n\nWashington \"will be prepared to review these actions when South Sudan is in full cooperation,\" Rubio added.\n\nThe world's newest country and also one of the poorest, South Sudan is currently prey to tensions between political leaders.\n\nSome observers fear a renewal of the civil war that killed 400,000 people between 2013 and 2018. Last month, the State Department ordered the departure of all non-emergency personnel from South Sudan's capital of Juba due to an increase in violence.\n\nSouth Sudanese nationals had been granted Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, by the Biden administration, with the designation set to expire on May 3, 2025.\n\nThe United States grants TPS, which shields people against deportation, to foreign citizens who cannot safely return home because of war, natural disasters or other \"extraordinary\" conditions.\n\nThere were about 133 South Sudanese in the U.S. under the TPS program, with another 140 eligible to apply, the Department of Homeland Security said in September 2023.\n\nBut the Trump White House has begun overturning TPS designations, revoking protection in January from more than 600,000 Venezuelans.\n\nA federal judge this week put that decision on hold after calling into question the government's claims that the majority of Venezuelans in the U.S. were criminals.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, as of March 2024, there were 1.2 million people eligible for or receiving TPS in the United States, with Venezuelans making up the largest group.\n\nThe Trump administration's singling out of South Sudan also comes after growing numbers of Africans attempted to enter the U.S. via its southern border — an alternative to risky routes into Europe.",

    "title": "RFK Jr. calls for end of fluoride in water, after Utah ban",
    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called Monday for the end of community water fluoridation, praising Utah's move to ban the addition of fluoride to the water supply.\n\n\"It makes no sense to have it in our water supply. And I'm very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it. And I hope many more will come,\" Kennedy told reporters in Utah.\n\nIt comes as the Environmental Protection Agency says it has now launched a new review of fluoride's health effects, working with Kennedy's department as it weighs whether to tighten federal restrictions on its addition to drinking water.\n\nKennedy will also be reconvening his department's Community Preventive Services Task Force to make a new recommendation on water fluoridation, an HHS official said. The federal task force previously recommended water fluoridation after a review in 2013, citing \"strong evidence\" of its public health benefits to reduce cavities outweighing its costs.\n\n\"As soon as I was nominated by President Trump as administrator of the EPA, the secretary instantly reached out to start talking about issues that he is so passionate about. And number one on that list was fluoride,\" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said.\n\nFluoride has been incorporated into public water supplies in much of the country for decades to help protect against tooth decay. Dental organizations and public health experts say it's a safe and low-cost intervention with proven benefits.\n\nKennedy, however, cited a previous review by the federal government's National Toxicology Program, which concluded that \"higher levels\" of fluoride was linked to lowered IQ in children. Those levels exceeded what's recommended in water systems.\n\nWhile the program's report concluded more research was needed into whether fluoride was actually affecting IQ at levels found in most U.S. drinking water, a federal court ruled last year that the report's findings were enough to warrant forcing the EPA to do more to address this potential risk.\n\nSpeaking with reporters Monday, Kennedy went further than the report, warning of multiple other potential health risks ranging from hyperthyroidism to osteoarthritis. He said adding fluoride to water \"clearly is doing harm\" and was undermining freedom of choice.\n\nThe EPA previously lowered its limits for fluoride in water in 2011, after a report from the National Academy of Sciences found some impacts on thyroid and arthritic symptoms might be possible under maximum limits at the time.\n\n\"They have not been completely well studied, but they are alarming enough that we shouldn't be demanding that parents accept something for their children and in their homes, that is essentially a medication,\" said Kennedy.\n\nThe American Dental Association has disputed claims that water fluoridation is unsafe, calling the report flawed. The organization cites continuing evidence that shows the policy substantially reduces cavity rates, especially for children in low-income communities.\n\nKennedy's remarks come days after he gutted the CDC's Division of Oral Health as part of the department's widespread layoffs.\n\nBefore it was eliminated, the division had been responsible for CDC's work promoting the safety and benefits of community water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay.\n\nThe health secretary did not directly answer a question about the prospect of reinstating many of the laid-off workers at his department, after he suggested last week that some of the cuts he ordered were mistakes.\n\n\"No, the program — what I said was that there are programs that there are — the programs have been consolidated,\" Kennedy told reporters.\n\nKennedy has faced criticism for layoffs impacting a wide range of federal health agency services, including forcing Food and Drug Administration officials to cut back on food and drug safety inspections and eliminating the CDC's only labs to investigate STD and viral hepatitis outbreaks.\n\n\"We didn't cut any core programs or any critical care programs or any scientific programs. Those programs are being consolidated in a new agency that is going to make America healthy again,\" he said.",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "Washington — House Speaker Mike Johnson reached a deal with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna amid her push to allow new parents to vote remotely, which paralyzed the House last week and threatened to delay a key vote on President Trump's agenda in the coming days.\n\nLuna, a Florida Republican, announced Sunday she and Johnson had a deal to use vote pairing — an agreement between an absent member and a member who is physically present and plans to vote on the opposite side of the question, effectively canceling out the vote. The present member casts their vote, then withdraws it and announces that they have paired with the absent member. The vote is not included in the vote total, but their positions are published in the Congressional Record.\n\n\"It will be open for the entire conference to use when unable to vote (e.g., new parents, bereaved, emergencies, etc.),\" Luna wrote Sunday.\n\nJohnson said Monday the solution is \"no harm, no foul\" and \"solved her concerns, so that's a great thing.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, suffered an embarrassing loss to kill the effort to allow new parents to vote remotely around the birth of their child. Johnson, who considers proxy voting to be unconstitutional, said any further floor action was halted and sent members home.\n\nA deal could allow House leaders to move ahead on other legislative priorities this week, including holding a vote on a Republican budget blueprint that passed the Senate over the weekend.\n\nMr. Trump weighed in Thursday on the debate, telling reporters that he supported Luna's effort to allow new parents to vote remotely. But a day later, Johnson wrote on social media that Mr. Trump told him, \"Mike, you have my proxy on proxy voting.\"\n\nThe measure to allow new parents to vote remotely was introduced by Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado in January. The bill would allow new parents to designate a colleague to vote for them for 12 weeks after they or their spouse gives birth. The bill would also allow that period to begin earlier if the lawmaker has a serious medical condition or isn't able to travel safely.\n\nLuna, a cosponsor of the bill, moved to bypass leadership and launched a discharge petition, a procedural move that allows a measure to move forward without the speaker's approval, to force a vote on it. The discharge petition quickly reached the threshold needed to force a vote, with 206 Democrats and 11 other Republicans signing on.\n\nBut Republicans tried to derail Luna's effort by inserting language into a rule governing debate on an unrelated bill on election security to table her discharge petition. Nine Republicans joined all Democrats during a procedural vote Tuesday to help sink it.\n\nPettersen said in a statement Monday that the agreement between Luna and Johnson \"does not address the barriers we've fought so hard to overcome.\"\n\n\"Instead of letting us vote, he has instead gone to historic lengths to kill our resolution and make sure the large majority of his Members don't have a voice,\" she said of Johnson. \"Let's be clear: these changes are not a win for us and Speaker Johnson has turned his back on moms and dads in Congress and working families.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called Republicans' opposition to allowing new mothers to vote remotely \"a strange hill to die on.\"\n\n\"What is the Republican problem with allowing expectant mothers to vote on behalf of their constituents?\" the New York Democrat said Monday.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

    "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
    "content": "The U.S. government's decision to arrest a Maryland man and send him to a notorious prison in El Salvador appears to be \"wholly lawless,\" a federal judge wrote Sunday in a legal opinion explaining why she had ordered the Trump administration to bring him back to the United States.\n\nThere is little to no evidence to support a \"vague, uncorroborated\" allegation that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was once in the MS-13 street gang, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis wrote. And in any case, she said, an immigration judge had expressly barred the U.S. in 2019 from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where he faced likely persecution by local gangs.\n\n\"As defendants acknowledge, they had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador — let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere,\" Xinis wrote.\n\nShe said it was \"eye-popping\" that the government had argued that it could not be forced to bring Abrego Garcia back because he is no longer in U.S. custody.\n\n\"They do indeed cling to the stunning proposition that they can forcibly remove any person — migrant and U.S. citizen alike —to prisons outside the United States, and then baldly assert they have no way to effectuate return because they are no longer the 'custodian,' and the Court thus lacks jurisdiction,\" Xinis wrote. \"As a practical matter, the facts say otherwise.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to pause Xinis' ruling.\n\nAbrego Garcia gets detained\n\nAbrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who has never been charged or convicted of any crime, was detained by immigration agents and deported last month.\n\nAbrego Garcia had a permit from DHS to legally work in the U.S. and was a sheet metal apprentice pursuing a journeyman license, his attorney said. His wife is a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe White House has described Abrego Garcia's deportation as an \"administrative error\" but has also cast him as an MS-13 gang member. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia said there is no evidence he was in MS-13.\n\nJustice Department attorney suspended\n\nIn her order Sunday, Xinis referenced earlier comments from now-suspended Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni in which Reuveni said: \"We concede he should not have been removed to El Salvador\" and that he responded \"I don't know\" when asked why Abrego Garcia was being held.\n\nThe Justice Department placed Reuveni on leave after he made the comments.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" likened Reuveni's comments to \"a defense attorney walking in, conceding something in a criminal matter.\"\n\n\"That would never happen in this country,\" she said. \"So he's on administrative leave now, and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nStacey Young, a former Justice Department lawyer and founder of Justice Connection, a network of department alumni that works to support employees, released a statement that defended Reuveni and said he has \"zealously represented the United States in some of the most high-stakes and controversial immigration cases under the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations.\"\n\n\"Justice Department attorneys are being put in an impossible position: Obey the president, or uphold their ethical duty to the court and the Constitution,\" Young said. \"We should all be grateful to DOJ lawyers who choose principle over politics and the rule of law over partisan loyalty.\"",

    "title": "Supreme Court allows Trump to enforce Alien Enemies Act for rapid deportations for now",
    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, handing the White House a significant victory that will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members.\n\nThe unsigned decision in the case, one of the most closely watched emergency appeals pending at the Supreme Court, lets Trump invoke the 1798 law to speed removals while litigation over the act’s use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that going forward, people who are deported should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed by the federal court where they are being detained.\n\nThe court’s three liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court’s conservative wing, partially dissented.\n\nTrump praised the decision in a Truth Social post, writing in all-caps that it was “a great day for justice in America.”\n\n”The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself,” he wrote.\n\nTrump administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, quickly applauded the decision, with Bondi describing it as a “landmark victory for the rule of law.”\n\n“An activist judge in Washington, DC does not have the jurisdiction to seize control of President Trump’s authority to conduct foreign policy and keep the American people safe,” the attorney general posted on social media.\n\n“President Trump was proven RIGHT once again!” Noem posted, adding, “LEAVE NOW or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.”\n\nTrump framed his emergency appeal as a fight over judicial power and, specifically, US District Judge James Boasberg’s order that temporarily blocked the president from enforcing the Alien Enemies Act against five Venezuelans who sued and a broader class of people who might be affected — in other words, anyone else. By granting the president’s request, the Supreme Court has tossed out Boasberg’s orders.\n\nCritically, the court made clear in its unsigned order that officials must give migrants subject to Trump’s proclamation adequate notice that they are being removed pursuant to the wartime authority so they have “reasonable time” to bring habeas complaints. Those are suits brought by people who claim they are being detained by the government unlawfully.\n\nA key concern among attorneys representing the migrants has been that the government’s rush to remove migrants under the act leaves them with little to no time to file such legal claims.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the court’s most senior liberal, argued the Trump administration’s conduct in the case “poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.”\n\n“That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible,” she wrote. “We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this.” Barrett, though she did not write separately, joined a key portion of Sotomayor’s dissent questioning whether habeas claims should be the exclusive way for people to challenge their deportations under the act.\n\nThe court’s order comes a day before Boasberg was set to hear arguments over whether to indefinitely block Trump’s use of the wartime authority for the deportations. The judge is separately weighing whether “probable cause” exists to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for violating his orders when it allowed deportation flights to continue last month. Trump and other administration officials have repeatedly attacked Boasberg as exceeding his authority, earning the president a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nIn her searing dissent, Sotomayor said the compliance issue before Boasberg “should be reason enough to doubt that the government appears before this court with clean hands.”\n\n“That is all the more true because the government has persistently stonewalled the District Court’s efforts to find out whether the government in fact flouted its express order,” she wrote, later adding that the administration’s “conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.”\n\nIn a separate dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson blasted the majority for ruling on the case using the emergency docket, without oral arguments or a more considered briefing. Jackson referenced the 1944 Korematsu case, in which the Supreme Court infamously allowed for the internment of hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\n“I lament that the court appears to have embarked on a new era of procedural variability, and that it has done so in such a casual, inequitable, and, in my view, inappropriate manner,” Jackson wrote.\n\n“At least when the Court went off base in the past, it left a record so posterity could see how it went wrong,” she wrote.\n\nTrump’s invocation of the centuries-old law\n\nAt issue was Trump’s invocation on March 15 of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives a president broad power to target and remove undocumented immigrants in times of war or when an enemy attempts an “invasion or predatory incursion.” Trump has argued the flow of alleged gang members from Venezuela constitutes an invasion.\n\nSoon after Trump invoked the law, officials loaded up three planes with more than 200 Venezuelan nationals and flew them to El Salvador, where they are being housed in a maximum-security mega prison. The administration has since said that some of those people were deported under authorities other than the 18th century act.\n\nThe Trump administration has said the men were affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nBut there have been growing questions about how those determinations were made. The court was considering the appeal amid revelations the administration mistakenly deported a Maryland father to El Salvador “because of an administrative error.” The deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia took place under a different legal authority — not the Alien Enemies Act — but it underscored the potential risks involved with the rapid deportations.\n\nEarlier Monday, the Supreme Court placed on hold a lower court order requiring the government to return Abrego Garcia to the US by midnight.\n\nBoasberg’s order halting additional removals didn’t block the administration from deporting alleged gang members under other laws, nor did it stop the administration from apprehending immigrants under the act. Trump nevertheless quickly appealed.\n\nThe DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 on March 26 that Boasberg’s orders could stand while the legal challenge plays out. The majority included one judge nominated by President George H.W. Bush and another by President Barack Obama.\n\nUS Circuit Judge Karen Henderson wrote that the term “invasion” was widely understood among the nation’s founders as involving a military invasion.\n\n“The phrase echoes throughout the Constitution ratified by the people just nine years before. And in every instance, it is used in a military sense,” she wrote.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "Orlando, Florida CNN —\n\nAs if the words from “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” have jumped off the page into reality, fluorescent green fog shrouds people walking through a wizarding world Floo Network transit tunnel, to be greeted on the other side by an atrium with soaring ceilings depicting moving storm clouds. It might be the first time Muggles (non-wizards) have been inside the Ministry of Magic.\n\nThat is just one jaw-dropping moment for guests to experience when Universal Orlando Resort officially opens its third and newest theme park, Epic Universe, on May 22. It is the first major theme park to open in central Florida in 26 years.\n\nAt 750 acres, including both guest areas and backstage space for employees, it is believed to be the largest theme park in the world and estimated to have cost up to $7.7 billion to build, according to Dennis Speigel, owner and founder of consulting firm International Theme Park Services. Universal hasn’t commented on the park’s cost.\n\n“I’ve seen them all,” Speigel said of theme parks around the world. And Epic Universe, he said, is “too damn good.”\n\nThat first impression has everything to do with Universal’s use of the most advanced technology available coupled with intentional design to build a sense that the visitor is truly in a fantastical space with no glimpse of the outside world.\n\nCNN's Natasha Chen inside Wizarding World of Harry Potter: Ministry of Magic CNN\n\nAt a media preview ahead of the public opening, CNN saw each of the park’s “worlds” and the experiences in them, including technology never seen in a theme park before.\n\nLet’s take you through each section.\n\nWhen you enter\n\nIt all begins with walking through Chronos, a portal that takes guests into the main hub of Epic Universe: Celestial Park.\n\nHere, guests will find Stardust Racers, a dual-track roller coaster, as well as Constellation Carousel, beautifully lit with animals that spin in different directions.\n\nThere are shops, restaurants and bars nearby. But that’s just the beginning. From this hub, guests can choose to enter four other portals, each leading them to a different world.\n\nInside Celestial Park CNN\n\nThe four ‘worlds’\n\n“It’s as if all of the worlds of Epic Universe are closed off from the rest of the park,” said Alicia Stella, owner of Orlando ParkStop.\n\nStella, who has been tracking the development of the park since its inception, said “when you enter those portals … you are no longer in a theme park. You are in the Isle of Berk, from ‘How to Train Your Dragon.’ You are in the video games of Nintendo. You are in the Wizarding World, and you are in the world of Universal monsters, at Dark Universe.”\n\nWhen guests are inside one of these spaces, the only thing visible beyond its walls and sets is perhaps the top of Helios, a glittering new hotel located in the center of the park.\n\nThrough one portal, in the world called Dark Universe, Universal brings to life its signature monsters including Dracula, the Wolf Man and the Invisible Man. The anchor attraction in this world — and one of the best in the park — is Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment, utilizing some of the most advanced, life-like robotic technology ever created.\n\nHarry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry: Before boarding this new ride at Universal's Epic Universe, visitors arrive in an atrium at the Ministry of Magic, where they encounter larger-than-life statues and soaring tiled ceilings. Natasha Chen/CNN In the atrium: The Ministry atrium shows an image of Dolores Umbridge, who is about to stand trial. Natasha Chen/CNN Wizards at work: The queue for the ride shows intricate details of Ministry office life. Natasha Chen/CNN Entering the Ministry: Guests enter the ride queue via the Metro Floo, which allows them to time travel from 1920s Paris to 1990s London. Natasha Chen/CNN Time travel: Ministry of Magic actually begins in 1920s Paris, the setting of the \"Fantastic Beasts\" series. Natasha Chen/CNN Celestial Park: Constellation Carousel will glitter at night. It's a cornerstone of Celestial Park, the Epic Universe hub. Natasha Chen/CNN On the carousel: Constellation Carousel has some animals that spin on their own axis, while others spin on a turntable. Natasha Chen/CNN Stardust Racers: Celestial Park also features a roller coaster called Stardust Racers, which has dual tracks crossing each other. Natasha Chen/CNN 'The Untrainable Dragon': In the How to Train Your Dragon - Isle of Berk world, \"The Untrainable Dragon\" stage show uses advanced technology to bring dragons to life on stage and overhead. Natasha Chen/CNN Dragons everywhere: Dragons lurk in all corners of the How to Train Your Dragon world. Natasha Chen/CNN Universal Helios Grand Hotel: Universal's newest hotel, Helios, sits inside the center of the park, giving hotel guests their own entrance to Epic Universe. Natasha Chen/CNN Watering holes: The Plastered Owl Bar in Celestial Park is attached to the Oak & Star Tavern, which serves breakfast and barbecue lunch. Natasha Chen/CNN Super Nintendo World: The entrance to Super Nintendo World is a warp pipe that takes guests up an escalator right into the middle of a video game. Natasha Chen/CNN Fuel for Nintendo fans: Guests inside Super Nintendo World can grab a bite at Toadstool Cafe. Natasha Chen/CNN Fun for kids: Yoshi’s Adventure is a slow-moving, kid-friendly ride within Super Nintendo World. Natasha Chen/CNN Epic Universe at Universal Orlando Resort Prev Next\n\nBut it’s through another portal, to Universal’s Wizarding World of Harry Potter: Ministry of Magic, that the resort has introduced its most ambitious ride to date. Universal Orlando Resort already has two themed Harry Potter areas in its existing parks, but the third installment within Epic Universe brings people into the 1920s Paris of the “Fantastic Beasts” offshoot story, full of street atmosphere, shops and restaurants.\n\nGuests will then be expected to time travel to experience the impressive ride, Harry Potter: Battle at the Ministry, going via metro tunnel from 1920s Paris into 1990s London, after the original Harry Potter series has concluded. Staff at the awe-inspiring Ministry of Magic are preparing for Dolores Umbridge’s trial, and guests will ride an omnidirectional elevator, chasing her through the building.\n\nVIDEO: Meet a life-like Toothless, the loveable dragon, at the new Epic Universe 00:31 - Source: CNN VIDEO: Meet a life-like Toothless, the loveable dragon, at the new Epic Universe 00:31\n\nEpic Universe’s third portal transports guests to the first-ever theme park land devoted to the “How to Train Your Dragon” franchise. Guests have told CNN that they have seen tests of large, extremely life-like dragons flying through the sky via drone, although those were not on display during media previews. Guests will find roller coasters and a kid-friendly boat ride in the midst of an elaborate Isle of Berk, where dragons breathe fire and ice. A technically impressive show inside a theater features Toothless, the lovable dragon from the series, who flies above the audience, landing on stage.\n\nSuper Nintendo World, which currently exists in Universal’s Japan and Hollywood park locations, now comes to Epic Universe through a fourth portal with a beloved Mine-Cart Madness ride themed to Donkey Kong, in addition to the go-kart racing ride, Bowser’s Challenge. Guests can wear special “Power-Up” bands on their wrists to play games and win points, running around a life-sized video game while Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach mill about.\n\nThe rides people will be talking about\n\nUniversal officials told CNN the company invented new technology and secured patents for Epic Universe experiences, including special animating effects, ride design and robotics.\n\nThe results are most obvious on two rides guests are most likely to be talking about after their visit: Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment and Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry.\n\nThe Harry Potter ride feels like an experience combining elements of Universal’s existing Spiderman ride and Disney’s Rise of the Resistance. It features trackless ride systems, augmented reality, and high-resolution projections combined in new ways.\n\nFor all the children who waited at midnight for the release of a new Harry Potter book a generation ago, “this is our new midnight release,” said Ryan Clavin, host of DIS Unlimited: Universal Show on YouTube.\n\nIn the Ministry of Magic, guests see Dolores Umbridge’s former office and meet Higgledy the house-elf. Universal Studios\n\nWhat it costs to visit\n\nLike many theme parks, Universal employs dynamic pricing for tickets, which varies depending on the season and how busy the parks are anticipated to be.\n\nSingle-day tickets for Epic Universe recently became available, starting from $139 for adults and $134 for children ages 3-9, plus tax. Those prices currently apply to some weekdays in September, with the most expensive single-day tickets priced at $199 and $194 for children, plus tax, during the late December holiday season.\n\nDisney World’s Magic Kingdom, the most visited theme park in the world, also has a ceiling of $199 during the same time frame.\n\nMulti-day ticket packages are also available, which allow guests to visit Epic Universe on one of those days. Per-day pricing on multi-day tickets is lower than single-day tickets.\n\nUniversal’s “Express Pass,” which allows guests to enter attractions through a faster line, can vary by date. These passes often cost more than the park ticket itself. For example, buying an Express Pass for the busy July 4 holiday at Epic Universe will cost $250 for a single day, a cost in addition to the ticket price.\n\nStella said she believes these prices are in line with existing parks.\n\n“I think it’s priced appropriately. Actually, a lot of us who are big fans of the theme park industry are surprised at some of the price points being as low as they are, because I feel like there was an opportunity to charge whatever they wanted for opening,” Stella said.\n\nShe added that Universal’s brand-new hotels near Epic Universe are also priced more affordably than she expected.\n\nThe elaborate How to Train Your Dragon – Isle of Berk is one of the four worlds. Universal Studios\n\nWhat the new park means for Universal’s biggest competitor\n\nWith so much buzz around Universal’s new park, industry experts are watching for Disney’s response.\n\n“Disney and Universal are in the greatest boxing match they’ve ever been in at this point in time, and it’s a slug fest,” Speigel said. “I believe that within 12 to 16 months, Disney will announce its fifth gate theme park, because it’s necessary.”\n\nDisney, still the dominant leader in the theme park industry, currently has four theme parks on its Walt Disney World property in central Florida, the last of which opened in 1998. For the moment, the company has announced a slew of new themed lands and attractions within existing parks, but no new theme park.\n\n“Is [Epic Universe] going to put Disney out of business? Absolutely not. Is it going to put a chink in their armor? Yes, it will,” Speigel said.\n\nUniversal’s momentum has ramped up ever since it opened the first area themed to the Harry Potter franchise in 2010 at its second Orlando theme park, Islands of Adventure. Speigel said Universal Orlando Resort saw a 36% increase in attendance in the year that followed, the biggest one-year increase he has ever seen in any park attendance in history.\n\nIn Disney’s 2024 fourth quarter earnings call, Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer of the Walt Disney Company, highlighted positive early bookings for this summer and said, “The history of other non-Disney parks opening in Florida has been positive for Disney bookings.”\n\nWhile that may be so, Stella believes the typical family vacation where most of the time is spent at Disney World, with a small portion of the week at Universal, may shift in balance.\n\nCelestial Park is the central hub of Epic Universe. Universal Studios\n\n“I could definitely see it being, ‘Well, we need two or three days at Universal, so we’ll only do two or three days at Disney,’” Stella said. “If they’re coming to Orlando anyway, or if they’re coming to Epic Universe on purpose, will they decrease their stay elsewhere, like Disney? Will they skip Sea World altogether?”\n\nSpeigel said, “Everybody subscribes to a rising tide floats all boats, but it does eat up some of the market too.”\n\nHe added that he expects 2025 to be a year of heavy discounting by all parks, not just to compete with Epic Universe, but to anticipate a worsening economy.\n\nEven with the stock market roller coasters and Goldman Sachs predicting that recession odds are rising, Speigel predicts at least 6 million guests will visit Epic Universe within its first year.\n\nClavin said what he saw on the Harry Potter ride is indicative of the spectacle Universal has created in the entire park: “This is sort of a very good example of why we love theme parks … Where else can you literally step into a movie like this?”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misspelled the Isle of Berk.",

    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nMost Americans might be rightly focused on President Donald Trump’s trade war and the tariff drama that has devalued retirement accounts and nest eggs and has Americans sweating higher prices.\n\nBut then something notable happened in the wee hours of Saturday morning when Senate Republicans advanced a budget blueprint that could make $3.8 trillion disappear.\n\nMath is notoriously fuzzy in Washington, DC.\n\nFor instance, the White House has made some conflicting arguments about reciprocal tariffs, simultaneously arguing they could raise $6 trillion over 10 years and that tariffs are a negotiating tactic to force concessions from other countries.\n\nIf the threat of tariffs leads to new trade deals, they won’t bring in trillions of new revenue to offset income tax cuts. Appearing at the White House Monday, Trump said countries are ready to negotiate and he threatened to add another 50% tariff to China after the communist country said it would match the 34% tariff Trump announced against China last week.\n\nThe trade war is part of the “medicine” Trump says is necessary to force companies to bring manufacturing back to the US.\n\nCreative accounting\n\nBut tariffs are only one leg of Trump’s economic plan. Trump also needs to extend tax cuts enacted during his first term and he also wants to add in some new ones.\n\nFor that, he’ll need Republicans on Capitol Hill to pass a law to make the tax cuts happen.\n\nWhich brings us to Saturday morning, when senators sent the House their version of a budget plan on a 51-48 vote. It envisions $1.5 trillion in spending cuts – smaller than the more than $4 trillion in a House version.\n\nRelated: Senate GOP adopts budget blueprint to advance Trump agenda as spending fight consumes Capitol Hill\n\nBut Senate Republicans got creative with their budgeting and broke with a 40-year precedent. Instead of counting the $3.8 trillion it will cost to extend Trump’s first-term tax cuts, they sidestepped the Senate parliamentarian.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, exerted power as the Budget Committee chairman and simply reinterpreted budget rules. He set the baseline for the budget at “current policy,” with the tax cuts, instead of current law, which assumes the tax cuts expire. By doing so, Graham erased trillions from the ledger for the purposes of moving the measure.\n\nThose individual tax cuts were originally passed on a temporary basis in so that they could be enacted through the budget process. Now Republicans are trying to make them permanent by tweaking the way the budget is calculated.\n\n‘Gaslighting’ accusation\n\nThis changing of the budget rules, along with spending cuts, is meant to free up room in the budget, both to extend expiring tax cuts and make room for new ones Trump promised during the presidential campaign, like ending taxes on income earned from tips and social security benefits.\n\nIf prices rise as a result of tariffs, as most economists predict, Trump will want to point to tax cuts as offsetting that inflation.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee described the redrawn budget baseline as “gaslighting from Republicans about the true cost of their tax plan.” But because budget bills are exempt from the normal 60-votes needed to break a filibuster, there’s little Democrats can do.\n\nThe budget process is far from over\n\nThere are still many steps to go. House Republicans do not particularly like the Senate’s blueprint but both chambers must pass the same thing in order to begin the budget reconciliation process and drafting legislation for Trump’s agenda.\n\nSome Republicans grumbled about the budget plan and the new accounting trick before voting for it.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said changing the budget rules would set a “dangerous” precedent.\n\n“To be a conservative is to know that sometimes you don’t open Pandora’s box, even if you can,” Cassidy said on the Senate floor before voting for the bill.\n\nAnd $5 trillion for the debt ceiling\n\nIn addition to wiping away that $3.8 trillion, senators also want to raise the debt limit by $5 trillion.\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of two Republicans to vote against the Senate budget resolution, said Republicans were trying to have it both ways by cutting programs through the Department of Government Efficiency, but then authorizing $5 trillion in new debt.\n\n“What worries me is that so many things in Washington are smoke and mirrors,” Paul said on the Senate floor. “On the one hand it appears as if all this great savings is happening. But on the other hand the resolution will increase the debt by $5 trillion. So which is it? Are we cutting spending or are we expanding the debt?”",

    "content": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nWhile many nations are scrambling to strike tariff deals with Trump, China is standing up to him, hoping to turn “crisis into opportunity.”\n\nWithin 48 hours of Trump’s market-hammering announcement of tariffs on countries across the world, the world’s second-largest economy swiftly retaliated with its own punitive measures on US goods and firms.\n\nThen, after the US president vowed to ratchet up tariffs again on Monday, Beijing once again vowed to hold the line. “The US threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake,” its Commerce Ministry said a statement.\n\nThe threat “once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the US,” the statement said. “China will never accept it. If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.”\n\nBeijing’s defiance is part of what has appeared to be a carefully calibrated confidence from a Chinese government that’s decided to position itself an oppositional force standing up to what it calls “unilateral bullying” from the US.\n\nOver the weekend, Beijing telegraphed a clear message for its domestic audience and foreign countries: China is well prepared to weather a trade war – and come out stronger on the other side.\n\n“US tariffs will have an impact (on China), but ‘the sky won’t fall,’” a commentary in the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s mouthpiece People’s Daily said Sunday.\n\n“Since the US initiated the (first) trade war in 2017 – no matter how the US fights or presses – we have continued to develop and progress, demonstrating resilience – ‘the more pressure we get, the stronger we become,’” read the commentary, which was also on the front page of the paper’s Monday edition.\n\nWith the “strong leadership” of China’s Communist Party and the country’s “institutional advantages,” China was “sure to turn crises into opportunities and move steadily into the future,” the commentary said.\n\nTrump on Wednesday unveiled an additional 34% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the US, bringing duties on all Chinese imports to the US to well over 54% when existing tariffs are taken into effect. Beijing hit back Friday with its own baseline 34% tariffs on all American imports, as well as other measures, including export controls on rare earth minerals and trade restrictions on specific US companies.\n\nOn Monday, the US president threatened to significantly ratchet up the trade war between the world’s two largest economies by slapping an additional 50% tariffs on Chinese imports midweek if Beijing doesn’t remove its retaliatory tariffs by Tuesday.\n\nThe American president also said China’s “requested meetings” with the US would be canceled.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announces global tariffs in the White House Rose Garden on April 2. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBeijing’s rhetoric in response speaks to what could be the strategic calculation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his cadres in Beijing: that Trump is not just using the tariffs as a negotiating tactic – and the epic disruption to global trade has the potential to hurt the US more than China.\n\n“Many (People’s Republic of China) counterparts have argued (the) US is making a mistake that will undermine its own global standing,” Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank, wrote on the social media platform X on Sunday, following meetings with government officials, scholars, business leaders during a visit to China.\n\n“There’s debate about whether the world is entering a period of blocs or a transition to an era of globalization minus the US. Beijing seems to prefer the latter scenario,” he said, adding that “China’s leaders will not countenance being seen as passive in response to US.”\n\n‘Ready to compete’\n\nAs Trump’s tariffs target friends and foe alike, Chinese officials have already in recent weeks looked to project China as an alternative champion and protector of a globalized economy that’s enhanced the prosperity of countries around the world, as well as a stable economic partner and haven for business.\n\n“As the world’s second-largest economy and the second-largest consumer market, China will only continue to open its doors wider, regardless of the changing international landscape,” China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday, Ling Ji, a vice minister at China’s Commerce Ministry, hosted representatives from 20 US-funded enterprises including Tesla and GE HealthCare, according to a ministry statement.\n\nLing touted China as an “ideal, safe, and promising” place for investment, while calling on American businesses to “be rational voices” and “take practical actions” to maintain the stability of global production and supply chains.\n\nEconomic experts speaking to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Saturday also played into the idea that the trade shake-up was an opportunity for Beijing.\n\n“China is sending a significant message to the world: we cannot back down or tolerate US bullying, as tolerance ultimately leads to more bullying,” said Liu Zhiqin, senior researcher at Chongyang Institute for Finance Studies in Renmin University of China, told the broadcaster.\n\n“China and the US are now direct rivals in reshaping the international trade order,” said another, Ju Jiandong, a professor at the People’s Bank of China School of Finance of Tsinghua University. “We’re willing to take on the challenge – we’re ready to compete with the US in redefining the new global trade system.”\n\nChina’s trade partners are likely to take such messaging with a grain of salt.\n\nBeijing is well known to have wielded access to its massive market as a weapon to coerce countries, often over political stances that sparked Beijing’s ire. Many will also be looking warily at whether Chinese exports will flood their own markets, hurting their own domestic production or driving down consumer prices.\n\nBut countries may have little choice but to look to strengthen ties with China if US tariffs, which hit American allies as well as rivals, become the new normal.\n\nBeijing over the past month held economic talks with Japan and South Korea, hit last week with 24% and 25% tariffs respectively, as well as with the European Union, which was slapped with 20% duties.\n\nMany Southeast Asian economies – key manufacturing hubs for companies looking to diversify away from China – have been hit particularly hard by Trump’s tariff war. While few want to pick a fight with Washington publicly, the region is rattled.\n\nIn Singapore, an ultra-connected free trade bastion known for treading a cautious diplomatic line, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong pulled few punches in a message to his fellow citizens over the weekend.\n\n“The recent ‘Liberation Day’ announcement by the US leaves little room for doubt,” he said. “It marks a seismic change in the global order. The era of rules-based globalization and free trade is over. We are entering a new phase, one that is more arbitrary, protectionist and dangerous.”\n\nDomestic challenges\n\nAn electronic board in a brokerage house window in Beijing displays a trading index on Monday. Andy Wong/AP\n\nChina, however, is still bracing for impact – and what could be an extended period of escalation between the two governments and their leaders.\n\nXi’s defiance risks “locking both leaders into an escalation spiral. No high-level diplomacy means no safety valve – the longer this drags, the harder it becomes for either side to de-escalate without losing face,” Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the US-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said last week.\n\nLast year, US-China totaled roughly half a trillion in trade, and the tariffs come as China has been seeing some glimmers of economic vitality following years grappling with a property sector crisis, high local government debt and the fallout from Beijing’s pandemic controls.\n\nThe Chinese government last month announced a slew of measures to rev up domestic consumption as it anticipated the hit to its export-powered growth.\n\nNow, China would “vigorously boost domestic consumption with extraordinary efforts … and introduce a series of reserve policies as appropriate,” according to the People’s Daily Sunday commentary.\n\nUnlike in many other countries, however, how the Chinese Communist Party’s navigates these challenges – and its tolerance for economic pain – will not be judged by opinion polls or an electorate that can vote it out of power for how it navigates the challenge.\n\nAnd in the shadow of Trump’s latest threat, the question of just how far – and fast – the trade war between the two largest economies could escalate looms even larger, with both governments still holding a number of options for how to ratchet penalties higher.\n\nAnd the more they do, the more difficult it may be for the world’s two largest economies to find a way out.",

    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nNew York CNN —\n\nA fluke of social media rumor-mongering just served up the closest thing to a crystal ball as you can get on Wall Street. And for President Donald Trump, it’s a glimpse at a future where he can be the market hero. If he’s paying attention.\n\nStocks tumbled Monday as investors around the world tried to digest just how devastating Trump’s self-inflicted tariff pain will be to the global economy. On Wall Street, major indexes opened more than 3% lower, in so-called bear-market territory — more than 20% off their most recent high just seven weeks ago.\n\nIt looked like yet another day of hemorrhaging market value in response to last week’s tariff announcement.\n\nBut less than an hour after the market opened, stocks abruptly reversed course, surging 8% in a matter of minutes. (Which, just to be clear, does not happen on a normal day.)\n\nThe jolt into positive territory was short-lived — a spark of hope kindled by a bogus rumor that Trump was weighing a three-month delay on tariffs. (The unsourced headline appears to have come from a tiny account on X, though as of Monday evening it was still unclear how it ultimately ended up on a CNBC chyron.) Once traders realized there was no truth to it, they sold off once again and returned stock tickers to a sea of red.\n\nWeird. But potentially instructive, if Trump is paying attention.\n\nThat fleeting moment of buying enthusiasm represented a potential off-ramp that we rarely (never?) see in a market sell-off this severe. It was Trump — not a pandemic, or a war, or the collapse of a financial house of cards — that created this mess. And with one sentence, he could undo all of it.\n\nTraders pounced on the fake headline because they are desperate for a sign — any sign — that a voice of sanity will make it into Trump’s ear. Any kind of delay would buy corporations some time to rearrange their supply chains and blunt the shock of tariffs. Even an indication that the White House is willing to negotiate with trading partners could help stem the losses.\n\nBut the cavalry of sanity isn’t coming. At least not yet. And at this point, the White House is already getting blamed for the financial market losses anyway, so there’s no real point in reversing course now, Mike O’Rourke, chief markets strategist at Jones Trading, told me Monday.\n\nTo its credit, the Trump administration is doing exactly what it has said it would do for months. It’s just that Wall Street didn’t expect the tariffs to be as harsh as they are, and they didn’t expect Trump to be so reckless with the stock market — the institution he once viewed as a real-time report card on his presidency.\n\n“I think it’s setting in that they’re going to follow through on this,” O’Rourke said. “And then the problem is, we’re going into earnings season, and you just have to think that every company is going to have negative comments … There’s not much you can optimistically look forward to, except the announcement of some type of trade deal that shows us a path forward.”\n\nThe White House’s muddled messaging on tariffs isn’t helping manage investors’ expectations.\n\nWhile Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro assured news outlets over the weekend that the tariffs are happening, Trump himself on Sunday indicated he was open to negotiating and that he’d been fielding calls from tech executives and world leaders all weekend. (CNN has reported that the Trump administration is in active discussions with Israel, Vietnam and India about the possibility of bespoke trade deals.)\n\nWith uncertainty emanating from DC, some on Wall Street say it’s time to send an unambiguous message to the president and his team: Don’t buy the dip.\n\nStocks are cheaper than they were a week ago, so it’s only natural investors may take a break from the sell-off and load up on some bargain assets. But going into dip-buying mode risks rewarding Trump for playing chicken with the global economy. Like training a puppy, you sometimes need a negative correction if you want it to stop peeing on the rug.\n\n”We need this market to crash — to keep the pressure on the administration,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told my colleague Matt Egan on Monday. That is a frankly shocking comment from an analyst as prominent as Yardeni, who also happens to have a Ph.D in economics from Yale.",

    "content": "Editor’s note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\n\nCNN —\n\nLike any seasoned travel professional, Raj Gyawali understands that occasional cancellations for circumstances like illness are simply part of doing business.\n\nBut Gyawali, founder of socialtours, a Kathmandu-based operator that specializes in creating customized, locally focused itineraries, recently experienced a first in his 20-plus year career: An American client backing out of a Nepal trip over his fears of traveling abroad during the current US administration.\n\n“A completely confirmed booking reversed itself when the person felt unsafe to travel,” Gyawali told CNN Travel, adding that he’s noticed an uptick among other American clients expressing similar concerns. “I completely understand the sentiment, because people feel uncomfortable to be coming from a country where they’ll have to defend [themselves] or be apologetic of where it is right now. And I think this is going to affect a lot of countries and a lot of travel, there’s no doubt about it.”\n\nA few months into Donald Trump’s second presidential term, emerging figures show a drop in demand from overseas travelers to the US. According to data from research firm Tourism Economics, visits from international tourists are expected to fall 5.1%, and spending is expected to drop 11%, representing a loss of $18 billion this year. Canadian tour companies in particular are seeing cancellations of up to 30%. Meanwhile, some European countries are advising trans and non-binary citizens to avoid the US.\n\nBut the reluctance isn’t just one-way. For some Americans planning trips abroad, or who are already traveling, the impacts of Trump’s second presidency are being deeply felt, as they adjust to new perceptions of America — and Americans — around the globe.\n\nSome are expressing fear or hesitation about traveling abroad because of perceived backlash in response to policies and actions by the current administration, including widespread tariffs, its treatment of ally nations, and threats to annex Canada and Greenland.\n\nSierra Malone, a public relations and digital marketing specialist, told CNN Travel she felt “more nervous” than usual ahead of an upcoming extended trip to Europe, which kicked off in France this month. For Malone, an experienced traveler who lived in England for three years while earning her bachelor’s degree, the trip marks a new life chapter as a digital nomad.\n\nBut trepidation has tempered Malone’s excitement.\n\n“Last time [Trump was in office], it felt embarrassing; this time it feels terrifying,” said Malone, who also writes a travel blog. “I haven’t been out of the country since January, but just knowing that the environment is going to be different, and kind of anticipating that, and just wondering how the world is looking at Americans — yeah, there’s definitely fear there.”\n\nNo longer welcome?\n\nEuropean favorites such as Paris are looking less welcoming to Americans. Benoit Tessier/Reuters\n\nTravelers concerned about America’s current reputation on a global level aren’t misinterpreting the prevailing mood around the US administration — especially in Europe.\n\nAccording to recent data from YouGov, a British market research and data analytics firm, “European favorability of the USA” has dropped considerably across seven major European countries since Trump took office for the second time.\n\n“Comparing our latest quarterly data with the last poll prior to Donald Trump’s re-election, favorable attitudes towards the United States have fallen by between six and 28 percentage points,” the report stated.\n\nIt noted that opinion toward the US is lowest in Denmark — little wonder, when Greenland, which Trump has vowed to annex, is an autonomous territory of the country. Just 20% of Danes express a favorable view of the US, plummeting from 48% in August 2024. Only around a third of respondents in Sweden, Germany, France and the UK viewed the US favorably, while Italians and Spaniards came in at 42 percent and 43 percent respectively.\n\n“You would expect the favorability scores to be reflective of current events, and we have done other research which finds people in western Europe are highly critical of the Trump administration’s position on Ukraine,” a YouGov spokesperson told CNN Travel via email.\n\nFor travelers like Lisa VanderVeen, a school administrator and avid traveler who spends between five and seven weeks abroad every year, the current administration’s global policies — including its stance on Ukraine, a potential travel ban on those entering the country, and “chaotic” trade policy which included the threat of a 200% tariff on European alcohol before culminating in a 20% tariff on all EU imports, which the bloc is preparing to retaliate against — have indeed cast a noticeably harsher spotlight on Americans traveling internationally compared to Trump’s first term.\n\n“Before, it felt more like he was viewed as a caricature of the US rather than a threat outside the country,” VanderVeen said. “Now it feels like he’s more directly relevant to people living in other countries.”\n\nAs a result, some Americans report feeling increasingly conflicted — and occasionally concerned for their safety — while abroad. “I’m torn between not wanting to have a target on me, especially as a solo traveler, but also feeling an obligation or a duty to sort of be an ambassador [for] our country,” VanderVeen said.\n\nShe also notes that when the topic of politics does come up and she feels comfortable discussing it, she makes it “very clear” that she has never voted for Trump.\n\nMalone, meanwhile, is wary of “being blamed about what’s going on” and “feeling helpless that I can’t do anything” as she anticipates possible conversations — or confrontations — during her time abroad. “I want to, like, write on my forehead, ‘I’m American, but I’m not that American, or that type of American,’” she said. “But it’s not that simple, either.”\n\n‘Protect tourism in this Trump-affected world’\n\nAmerican tourists are asking how to dress to fit in with locals in destinations such as Berlin. David Gannon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEduardo Santander, CEO of the European Travel Commission, told CNN via email that the most recent arrivals data “show no indication that recent political events have affected US travel to Europe,” and that “the American market remains a cornerstone of European tourism.”\n\nBut some tourism experts are preparing for changes ahead. For Gyawali, the travel industry as a whole needs to take a more proactive stance in order to adapt to the challenges at hand affecting both travelers and the businesses they fuel. In other words, “Time to strategize how to protect tourism in this Trump-affected world,” as he put it in a recent LinkedIn post about the recent cancellation by his US client.\n\nEthical Travel Portal Norway, a tour company in which Gyawali is a partner, is also “bracing” for cancellations from American clients, who make up a large portion of the business. As a result, he says, communication with US clients is increasingly focused on projecting a sense of empathy instead of simply glossing over their concerns or fears, which is “not the right way to deal with it,” Gyawali says.\n\nGyawali has ideas at the industry level, too, such as pulling together tourism experts in a possible “think tank” initiative to collaborate on best practices. “The tourism industry, typically, is reactive,” he says. “They get a crisis, and then they start facing it. I think we need a little bit more pro-action in something like this, where you preempt the issues that come in.”\n\nTravelers, meanwhile, can employ a few strategies of their own, starting with the packing process (hint: this is the time to rethink that US flag shirt, and be sure to leave potentially offensive or political-leaning clothing or accessories at home). Nick Leighton, a Manhattan-based etiquette expert and co-founder of the podcast “Were You Raised by Wolves?”, says he’s noticed a recent increase in questions from listeners about how best to “blend in” while traveling abroad.\n\nLeighton notes that Americans should resist the urge to say they’re from Canada in an attempt to avoid an uncomfortable situation (a popular social media topic). “Unless there’s a truly compelling reason to hide one’s nationality, honesty is always the best policy,’’ he says. “Indeed, it’s important for people around the world to meet as many different types of Americans as possible and see that we all represent more than just our passports.”\n\nThat travel can offer an opportunity for cross-cultural connection in tumultuous times is a key motivation for VanderVeen while interacting with locals abroad. “People understand that we’re just human beings too, and certainly not all of us voted for what’s happening in our country right now — and especially as it relates to our country’s perceived lack of welcome or unfriendliness to other people in this world,” she said.\n\nJessica Flores, chief experience officer at Tourism Cares, a leading nonprofit focused on sustainability in the travel industry, also reminds travelers that “empathy goes a long way” if they encounter a heated situation. “Try to understand the underlying concerns and adjust your behavior if necessary,” Flores said. “Often, simply being kind, patient and curious can defuse tense situations and help forge connections.”",

    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "London CNN —\n\nWealthy business leaders are turning on US President Donald Trump over his plan to impose a colossal set of tariffs on America’s trading partners, as losses mount on stock markets around the world.\n\nBillionaire investor Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump’s 2024 presidential bid, warned Sunday that going ahead with the new tariffs was tantamount to launching an “economic nuclear war.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he would impose significantly higher “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries that have the highest trade imbalances with the United States.\n\nIn a post on X, Ackman said “business investment will grind to a halt, (and) consumers will close their wallets” if the new levies do indeed come into force. “We will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,” he added in the post, which was viewed 10.6 million times.\n\nUnless Trump changes tack, “we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down,” the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management warned.\n\n“What CEO and what board of directors will be comfortable making large, long-term economic commitments in our country in the middle of an economic nuclear war?” he said, adding that “the president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe.”\n\nAlready Trump’s baseline 10% tariff on all goods imports into the US went into effect Saturday, and dozens of economies are bracing for even higher levies starting Wednesday. Those harder-hit countries include major US trading partners China and the European Union, which face new duties of 34% and 20% respectively.\n\nOther billionaires and wealthy business leaders have also openly criticized Trump’s tariff agenda in recent days as fear over its economic fallout gripped markets.\n\nJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, warned Monday that the tariffs threatened to raise prices, drive the global economy into a downturn and weaken America’s standing in the world.\n\n“The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” Dimon said in an annual letter to shareholders. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.”\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of the Duquesne Family Office, an investment firm, said in a post on X Monday that he did “not support tariffs exceeding 10%.” Druckenmiller is worth an estimated $11 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nLater in the day, billionaire Ken Fisher, the founder and executive chairman of Fisher Investments, said on X: “What Trump unveiled (last) Wednesday is stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools. Yet, as near as I can tell it will fade and fail and the fear is bigger than the problem, which from here is bullish.”\n\nFisher noted that he does not typically comment publicly on presidential actions, “but on tariffs Trump is beyond the pale by a long shot.”\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon pictured in Washington, DC, in October 2024. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nEven Elon Musk — the world’s richest man and top Trump acolyte — said Sunday that he hoped for a “zero-tariff situation” between Europe and the US. In an interview with Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini via video link, Musk said he wanted to see an effective “free-trade zone” created between Europe and North America.\n\nEchoing Ackman, Simon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said businesses were likely to hold off making investments due, in large part, to the “sheer uncertainty” of Trump’s tariff policy.\n\n“If you’re a mid-sized or even a large-cap company, you’re going to be very hesitant about what to do,” he said.\n\n“If those tariffs are going to be negotiated back down again in a few months’ time, then you’d be wasting your time investing potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in new plants… in the US,” he told CNN.\n\nIn his post, Ackman said the new tariffs were “massive” and “disproportionate,” saying: “This is not what we voted for.” He called for a 90-day “time out” in which Trump could negotiate with trading partners to “resolve unfair asymmetric tariffs deals.”\n\nTrump has said his tariff agenda is designed to redress years of lopsided trade between America and its partners, caused, in his view, by other countries imposing steeper tariffs on US goods imported into their markets than the US does on theirs.\n\nBut investors are clearly not convinced by the wisdom of Trump’s plan. Stock markets in Asia and Europe plunged Monday and futures pointed to another bad day for US stocks, following Trump’s tariffs announcement last Wednesday.",

    "content": "Replay with sound CNN Special Report Recruited by gangs, exploited by Iran Intel sources say Swedish teens are being used to target Israeli interests\n\nAs darkness enveloped Stockholm one evening last May, the city set into its nocturnal rhythm and its criminal underworld came alive.\n\nIn a home in Västerås, a lakeside city 60 miles west of the capital, a mother completed her nighttime routine, comforted by the sight of her 15-year-old son safely in bed. But, just before midnight, the teenager silently rose and slipped out.\n\nA job awaited him, one he believed would be over before daybreak, well ahead of his national math examination.\n\nOutside, an Uber arrived. Someone else had arranged the transportation for him, court and police documents show. The documents, which include texts he exchanged, detail his journey.\n\nThe following messages have been edited for clarity and length.\n\nWait for taxi Go to Tyresö Locate weapon Go to embassy Brother listen tell them I’m ready whenever whenever Tell me when you in taxi Quick bro Brother I said don’t turn off until you’re in the taxi Call me brother Hey brother call me Brother how can you do this to me I gave you everything I’ve always helped you now you’re not responding to me Brother I’ve got no WIFI, only have it on this one The taxi pulled up to a parking lot in the Stockholm suburb of Tyresö, according to Uber records. There, he was instructed over text messages to pick up a gun. There, behind the red house Where I’m zooming in There’s the gun We’re booking the next taxi now Take the gun quickly Load it and conceal it The taxi is there any minute He put it in his right jacket pocket. Another taxi pulled up and he climbed in. Search The taxi pulled up to a parking lot in the Stockholm suburb of Tyresö, according to Uber records. There, he was instructed over text messages to pick up a gun. He put it in his right jacket pocket. Another taxi pulled up and he climbed in. Just moments earlier, he’d looked up the destination he was being driven to: the Israeli embassy in Stockholm. He never arrived.\n\nShortly after starting the final leg of his journey, blue lights flashed, police swarmed, and he was arrested.\n\nBut, just over 24 hours later, another boy, 14, made it.\n\nA 9mm semi-automatic pistol in hand, he fired several shots near the embassy at 2 a.m. before being detained.\n\nThe 14-year-old was not prosecuted because he was under-age, while the 15-year-old was convicted of a serious weapons offense and ordered to spend 11 months in a juvenile care home.\n\nPolice say the attempted attacks were among several last year targeting the Israeli embassy in Stockholm. Swedish Security Service (SÄPO) sources have told CNN they were carried out by gangs acting on behalf of Iran, making an existing crisis even more dangerous.\n\nSweden has been battling a wave of gang violence that has increasingly involved children and teenagers. According to interviews for this investigation with over two dozen sources, including former gang members, several social workers, prosecutors, lawyers, criminologists and members of the security services, gangs are recruiting children who are too young to be jailed to carry out violent jobs. Social media is a key tool in their exploitation, the sources said, with gangsters coaching them online to commit crimes, ranging from vandalism to bombings and contract murder.\n\nA view of Riddarfjärden bay, covered in ice, in central Stockholm, Sweden. The city is home to about 1.7 million residents. Alex Platt, CNN\n\nLast year, SÄPO warned that Iran was using the country’s criminal networks to do its bidding in an expansion of its regional conflict with Israel but offered few further details. Iran’s embassy in Stockholm rejected the claims at the time as “fake and propagandistic” information pushed by Israel.\n\nCNN spoke with multiple Swedish police and security sources about the alleged foreign activity for this investigation. Not all would comment on the record, but those that did said that the Iranian government has been working with local gangs to plot political attacks on Israeli and Jewish interests. In many cases, they said, children were involved.\n\nIranian authorities declined to comment on CNN's investigation.\n\nA source in SÄPO told CNN two rival Swedish gangs, known as Foxtrot and Rumba, plotted several attacks targeting the Israeli embassy in Stockholm at Iran’s behest last year. They included an attempted attack involving an explosive device on January 31, the foiled attempt on May 16 and the shooting on May 17, as well as what a Swedish prosecutor described as an incident involving gunfire on October 1.\n\nThe prosecutor handling the October shooting said that the suspect was identified in connection with explosions near the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen, in neighboring Denmark, a day later. That case is still ongoing.\n\nMost of the attacks reviewed by CNN involved suspects under the age of 18 who are treated differently to adults in the Swedish criminal justice system, with a focus on remediation and a higher chance of prosecution being waived. According to court records, they appeared to have little idea who was directing their movements.\n\n“It becomes a problem for us when it's another state like Iran that uses these kids as a proxy,” Fredrik Hallström, head of operations at SÄPO, told CNN, describing the practice as murder-for-hire or crimes-for-service. “Organized crime in Sweden right now is a huge vulnerability that is being used by state actors.”\n\n“After the 7th of October, we saw this type of modus operandi,” he added, referring to the Hamas-led attacks on Israel in 2023 that triggered the war in Gaza. Hamas is backed by Iran.\n\nIran and Israel have been engaged in a “shadow war” for years, deploying spies, paid assassins, criminal networks, cyber-activity and other covert means to strike each other, primarily in the Middle East. But, in recent years, the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom have warned of an uptick in Iranian state threats in the West, with plots carried out by proxies targeting dissidents and journalists, as well as Israelis and Jews.\n\nCNN found recent examples of planned attacks on Israeli and Jewish sites in Europe where criminal networks linked to Iran allegedly exerted pressure on local people to carry out the crimes, according to court documents. Among the targets: a synagogue and Jewish memorial center in Germany, and a Jewish restaurant and prayer center in Greece.\n\nThe perpetrator of one of the incidents in Germany had no prior criminal record and the court found he had been pressured to act. While in Greece, one of the accused, an undocumented migrant from Pakistan, showed the court evidence of being coerced. Iran denied being behind the incidents.\n\nTogether, the cases hint at the use of vulnerable proxies to carry out operations in Europe. Now, security sources say, Iran is enlisting unsuspecting children.\n\nMagnus Ranstorp, a counterterrorism expert at the Swedish Defence University, said that though the operations are not very sophisticated, given the alleged perpetrators are young and inexperienced, they are very serious.\n\n\"They are just the tool,” he said, speaking about the young people. “They're really sort of pressed to do this.”\n\nA national disaster\n\nSweden, known for having one of the world’s most generous social safety nets, and a strong culture of looking after vulnerable people, has become synonymous in recent years with violent crime in Europe. It now has one of the highest gun crime rates on the continent, according to a study by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå).\n\nFears about the crisis have come to dominate the political landscape in Sweden, playing a role in the right-leaning coalition coming to power in 2022 on a promise to be tough on crime. The government has tightened immigration policies, enforced harsher sentences for gun crime and broadened police surveillance powers. The measures, critics say, have ignored the underlying issues driving gang warfare, like widening economic inequality and social segregation.\n\nIn January alone, there were 33 gang-related explosions in Sweden – the highest monthly figure ever recorded in the country, according to a 2025 Swedish police report. In 2024, 30% of suspects in firearm-related murders were under 18, compared to around 20% in recent years, the same report said.\n\nGun violence remained the most common cause of violent death in Sweden in 2024, but the country’s homicide and manslaughter rate dropped amid an increase in surveillance, according to statistics released by Brå in March.\n\nThe number of youths in Sweden suspected of weapons offenses rose seven-fold in a decade The share of 15- to 17-year-olds among people suspected of illegal possession of a pistol or automatic weapon in Sweden increased from 5% in 2012 to 11% in 2022. Number of people suspected of weapons offenses in Sweden Source: Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention\n\n“It is a national disaster,” John Forsberg, superintendent of the Swedish National Police, told CNN, adding that kids are now crossing borders to carry out crimes making it a Europe-wide problem.\n\nGangs often entice children and teenagers with expensive items, initially assigning seemingly innocuous tasks that then escalate over time. “They are blinded by the hunt for money and status and materialistic things. They are obsessed with the thought of having cash to go and buy clothes with,” said Luay Mohageb, a former Swedish police interrogator who has worked on multiple cases involving children in gangs.\n\nBut other personal and socio-economic drivers are also at play. Factors include seeking belonging, status, and financial gain – especially when legitimate opportunities are scarce.\n\n“You need to see the root of the problem,” Rene Lobos, a former gang member who now helps children get out of gangs, told CNN, adding that young people “are so insecure in who they are, they don't have role models when they grow up.” Being part of these gangs, he said, gives them a sense of community.\n\nRene Lobos, a former gang member, works with children to help them get out of criminal life. Alex Platt, CNN\n\nThe mother of the 15-year-old who was arrested on his way to the Israeli embassy in Stockholm in May 2024 told authorities that she believed her son was being taken advantage of. She said that older people he spent time with, who might have been behind getting him the “job,” acted as his “big brothers,” protecting and supporting him – and making him feel safe.\n\nCriminal networks strategically recruit teenagers, as they are not only easier to manipulate but are also given lighter sentences, according to security experts CNN spoke with. In Sweden, children under 15 cannot be held legally responsible for crimes, while those between 15 and 18 are typically referred to social welfare authorities rather than sentenced to prison.\n\nSwedish prosecutor Lisa dos Santos told CNN that the use of minors enables more senior gang members to evade law enforcement. “They lack connection to both target and gang leader who wants the assignment done. It makes it harder to trace.”\n\nExperts say Foxtrot, one of Sweden’s most feared gangs, has fueled the surge in violence playing out on Sweden’s streets, using teenagers to carry out crimes. The gang wars worsened in 2023 when Foxtrot’s leader, Rawa Majid, launched a feud with former ally, Ismail Abdo, who became leader of the rival gang known as Rumba.\n\nIran is using Swedish gangs and the teenagers recruited by them as proxies, Swedish security services say Source: Swedish Security Service (SÄPO) sources\n\nBoth men are wanted for multiple charges, including gross narcotics offenses, according to Interpol Red Notices for their arrest. Majid faces charges of instigating murder, and Abdo faces charges of instigating attempted murder.\n\nThe US Treasury Department recently sanctioned Foxtrot and its leader Majid, who it said was cooperating with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). It accused the gang of orchestrating attacks on Israelis and Jews in Europe on behalf of Iran, including the January 2024 attempted attack on the Israeli embassy in Stockholm, adding that the group “routinely uses teenagers.”\n\nAnnouncing the sanctions in early March, the Treasury said that the Iranian regime had increasingly used criminal networks as proxies. “Iran’s brazen use of transnational criminal organizations and narcotics traffickers underscores the regime’s attempts to achieve its aims through any means, with no regard for the cost to communities across Europe,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.\n\nMajid left Sweden in April 2019 and has since been based in Sulaymaniyah, a Kurdish city in northern Iraq, according to Swedish police files related to an investigation into the gang leader. The files indicate he has continued to communicate with criminal associates and oversee operations via encrypted chats often using the alias “Foxkurdish” in reference to his nickname, the Kurdish Fox.\n\n“Iran has a lot of influence in Iraqi Kurdistan,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, a senior advisor on Iran at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank, said, explaining why Iran might recruit Majid. Cooperation between the Iranian regime and Iraqi Kurds grew during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war that ended in 1988, he added.\n\nAbdo’s whereabouts remain unclear but there were local reports in May 2024 of his arrest in Turkey’s southern Adana province and subsequent release on bail.\n\nIsrael’s Mossad intelligence agency alleged last year that both Majid and Abdo were working with Iran and blamed their gangs for attempted attacks on the Israeli embassy in Stockholm, according to Israeli media reports.\n\nCNN reached out to Mossad for more information about its claims and for comment on this report but has not received a response.\n\nGamification of gang warfare\n\nThe gangs are increasingly turning to online platforms to recruit youths, offering them money in exchange for targeted killings.\n\nDos Santos said criminal tasks are posted on a variety of public platforms, including Snapchat and Instagram. Those interested are often asked to message the person ordering the hit privately, she said. Then, they are included in private groups on encrypted platforms such as Signal and Zangi messenger.\n\nJustice ministers from Sweden, Denmark, and other Nordic nations met with representatives from Meta, Google, TikTok and Snapchat in December to discuss how the platforms would stop gangs from using their services to recruit young people. The four companies have been collaborating under TechSverige (TechSweden) to establish a Nordic knowledge-sharing forum aimed at tackling the issue, though Snapchat told CNN it had not seen “clear signs of gang recruitment” on its platform.\n\nDanish Minister of Justice Peter Hummelgaard said at the time that \"more concrete action” must be taken to ensure digital platforms don’t facilitate violent crimes. He also criticized Signal and Telegram for failing to attend the meeting.\n\nMeta, Google, TikTok, Snapchat and Telegram told CNN they monitor, identify and remove harmful content that violates their policies and the law using AI tools and human moderation. They also said they prohibit and combat incitement to crime, criminal activity and recruitment, working with law enforcement agencies to keep people – particularly children – safe.\n\nCNN reached out to Zangi Messenger and Signal with queries but has not received responses.\n\nWatch CNN’s full investigation\n\nOscar Waldner, a doctoral student at Malmö University researching how criminal networks use social media and the internet, said that gangs are advertising illicit activities online in “a very explicit way” for large sums.\n\nCNN analyzed public Telegram channels that Waldner linked to criminal networks. There, groups use seemingly innocuous symbols to order up attacks: A skull emoji signals murder, while a dollar emoji represents payment, according to Swedish prosecutors and academics CNN spoke with. Foxtrot is often referred to with a fox emoji, while Rumba uses a strawberry emoji, in reference to the strawberry business Abdo used to run, a Swedish police source said. The Telegram channels were removed in recent months.\n\nA Telegram spokesperson told CNN that it had taken down criminal recruitment content in Sweden when it was discovered in August, and that moderators have continued to remove new attempts. The spokesperson added that the company abides by the EU’s content moderation law, the Digital Services Act, and provides channels for authorities to issue takedown requests.\n\nThe normalization of gang violence on social media creates a dangerous cycle where crime is glorified, criminologists, counter-terrorism experts and social workers told CNN, adding that often children are groomed online in real time.\n\n“These kids are filming everything. They take pictures of themselves with that gun and send it to friends, you know, before the shooting or after the shooting and bragging about it because they know through these ads, (they) gain social status,” Mohageb said, referring to the online posts where gangs offer money for carrying out crimes.\n\nChildren’s exposure to violent content online is something that concerns European authorities more broadly.\n\n“Groups of often very young individuals form online around narratives of violence, rather than ideologies,” said Anna Sjöberg, head of Europol’s European Counter Terrorism Centre.\n\n“They exchange violent content and fantasies about how to act out violence and this vulnerability to violent narratives makes them a profitable recruitment pool for terrorist organizations or organized crime groups.”\n\n‘I’ll leave him some cool clothes’\n\nIn his testimony, the 15-year-old from Västerås, who was arrested on his way to the Israeli embassy, said he initially thought the job last May was to move cannabis, and that he felt “cheated and angry” when he was told to pick up a weapon.\n\nHe claimed that only three days earlier, he had been asked if he would carry out a hit on the Israeli embassy and had refused because of its political nature, adding that he didn’t know where he was going that night until he was already in the Uber.\n\nThe brother of the 14-year-old detained for firing shots near the embassy a day later said he hadn’t thought his brother was \"capable\" of carrying out the alleged attack, according to a wiretap commissioned by the Swedish police following the incident and included in court documents. “I thought he would shoot once. Get scared and run away,” he is heard saying, adding that he was surprised that his brother emptied the whole magazine.\n\n“So, they thought it was a terror attack, brother. He is labeled as a terrorist, man... It said in the news... like this shooting at Israel’s embassy,” he said on another call.\n\nThe phone calls suggest just how simple the rewards are for carrying out such serious crimes.\n\nIn one of the wiretapped conversations, the boy’s brother is heard telling an unknown caller that he received the money and hid it. “I pick up my part. (He) has his. Yes. When I visit him at SiS (Swedish National Board of Institutional Care), I leave him some really cool clothes and stuff. Stuff that he wants.”\n\nOn the brother’s phone, in deleted files, police found a photograph of two masked people posing with a large sum of money, holding thick stacks of 500 kroner (about $50) notes.\n\nIn another conversation, he reiterated his fears for his younger brother, and an unknown speaker tries to reassure him. “No, but automatically, it will be dismissed. But I mean, he can still be put to a rehabilitation centre or something like that... But he won’t get any marks on his records,” the person said.\n\nSocial workers CNN spoke to emphasized that children recruited into gangs should be seen as victims of a system that has failed to protect them, rather than criminals. Without strong intervention, they said, the children remain at risk of further exploitation, caught in a cycle of violence.\n\nDirectly after his arrest, sitting in the patrol car, the 15-year-old told one of the police officers that it was too late for him to get out of the gang.\n\n“They’ll still find you no matter where you are,” he said, according to the police report, adding that the violence in Sweden would only get worse.",

    "content": "Houston's Joseph Tugler dunks the ball during the Cougars' late-game rally against Duke on Saturday. Jamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nIt was a comeback that seemed so unlikely until it exploded into reality.\n\nWith 8:17 to go in the game, Duke’s Tyrese Proctor hit a free throw to put his team up by 14.\n\nHouston had scored one time in the previous five minutes and looked like they had nothing left.\n\nAnd then everything changed.\n\nLed by LJ Cryer, as they were throughout the whole game, the Cougars clawed their way back into it over the next eight minutes, eventually pulling off one of the most shocking, incredible and unlikely comebacks in Final Four history.\n\nCryer hit a 3-pointer with 8:02 on the clock and then sunk a free throw minutes later after a Duke turnover to cut the deficit to 10. He missed his next free throw but Houston got the rebound and Cryer hit another jumper to bring the Cougars within eight.\n\nWith 5:55 to go, J’Wan Roberts hit a layup to cut the deficit to six and the red parts of the crowd at the Alamodome were suddenly stirring. A second-chance tip in a minute later made the Cougars believe.\n\nProctor hit two more free throws to rebuild the lead and then Cooper Flagg, the all-everything freshman for the Blue Devils, hit a 3-pointer with three minutes to go. The Duke lead was now nine and it looked like that was going to be enough to snuff out the Houston comeback attempt.\n\nThen Emmanuel Sharp entered the chat.\n\nHouston's Emanuel Sharp scores a layup late in the second half against Duke. Robert Deutsch/Imagn Images/Reuters\n\nA layup and two free throws from Sharp cut the lead back down to five with 1:27 to go. Flagg answered with two free throws of his own and the lead was seven with 1:26 to play. Sharp hit two more free throws with 1:14 left to cut the deficit to five again.\n\nSuddenly, all hell broke loose.\n\nFirst, Houston’s Joseph Tugler touched the ball while Duke was trying to inbound it, getting a technical foul. Kon Knueppel made the free throw and Duke got the ball back with a chance to seal it. But Tugler wasn’t going to go out on a mistake like that – he blocked a Knueppel layup attempt and the ball went back down the court, where Sharp hit another 3-pointer to make it 67-64 with 33 seconds to go.\n\nDuke got the ball inbounds after some trouble and Sion James made a bad mistake at a bad time, throwing an errant pass that was nabbed by Mylik Wilson. Wilson ran down the floor and shot a 3 to tie, but it missed – but there was Tugler again to jam home the rebound and cut the deficit to one.\n\nHouston fouled Proctor on the inbounds play for a one-and-one free throw opportunity. He bricked it and J’Wan Roberts grabbed the rebound. Flagg fouled him quickly with an over-the-back call that has been dissected afterward and, improbably, Houston was shooting free throws to take the lead with 19 seconds left.\n\nRoberts nailed them both and Houston had a one-point lead. Duke had one more chance and they went to their superstar, but Flagg couldn’t make the jumper.\n\nWilson grabbed the rebound and got the ball back to Cryer, who was fouled and sunk two more from the charity stripe. One last heave from Proctor went way wide of the basket and the Alamodome hit an ear-damaging decibel level as the Houston fans went absolutely insane.",

    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "See all topics Follow\n\nDeadly rain across the South and Midwest is finally subsiding Monday, but the danger for many communities is increasing. They only have to look at the rapidly rising rivers to see what’s coming.\n\n“As long as I’ve been alive — and I’m 52 — this is the worst I’ve ever seen it,” Wendy Quire, the general manager of the Brown Barrel restaurant in downtown Frankfort, Kentucky, told The Associated Press.\n\nFloodwaters inundated communities Sunday, the result of days of rain from storms that claimed at least 22 lives since the middle of last week.\n\nRivers were still on the rise in several already flood-ravaged states, with water levels at 19 measurement points on multiple rivers across the Midwest and South at the “major flood” stage Monday evening, according to the National Weather Service. The Kentucky River crested in Frankfort, the capital, just shy of the city’s protective flood walls Monday morning.\n\n“It’s good to be able to come out this morning and it not be raining. We’re thankful for that, but we’re still dealing with water rising,” said John Ward, sheriff of Hardin County, which is south of Louisville on a bend in the Ohio River.\n\n“I’ve seen homes underwater that have never had water. I don’t think people were ready,” Ward told CNN’s Kate Bolduan on Monday morning.\n\nOver a foot of rain has fallen since Wednesday across the mid-South where some locations – including Memphis, Tennessee – recorded nearly an entire spring’s worth of rain in just a few days. On Saturday, over a dozen daily rainfall records were set in Arkansas and Tennessee. Little Rock got over six inches, and Nashville got nearly four inches. Memphis hit 5.47 inches, making Saturday the city’s wettest day ever in April.\n\nThe rain was dumped by destructive storms that also produced tornadoes across the central US. The NWS has rated at least 60 tornadoes since the storms began, with five rated as EF3 strength. As of Saturday, the US had seen 10 consecutive days of tornadoes.\n\nThe storms have left at least 22 people dead across seven states, including 10 in Tennessee. Among them are a 5-year-old boy found in a storm-damaged home in Arkansas and a 9-year-old Kentucky boy who was swept away by floodwaters while walking to his school bus stop. On Sunday, a father and son were killed on a Georgia golf course when the tree they were sheltering under during high winds fell, Muscogee County Coroner Buddy Bryan told CNN.\n\n“Remember, this event is not over until the waters have receded, until the areas that have flooded are fully dry, until we don’t have saturated ground that could create mudslides over roads and bridges,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday.\n\nIn several parts of Kentucky, the intense flooding has endangered the local water supply. Authorities in Mercer County expect that they’ll run out of water Monday night, according to a statement from the schools superintendent.\n\nThe Frankfort Plant Board announced Sunday it had turned off the electrical equipment used to pump water from the river and asked customers to “ration their water usage.” And in Harrodsburg, water pumps were turned off overnight as flood levels came close to the city’s “raw water station.” Now, “we are using stored water and the supply is limited,” reads a Facebook post from the city.\n\nPeople in a boat navigate a flooded road on Sunday in Frankfort, Kentucky. Jon Cherry/AP\n\nFloodwaters devastate swath of Kentucky\n\nThe widespread flooding has triggered evacuations, water rescues and warnings to move to higher ground across the Bluegrass State. Many people are still in harm’s way as others start to dig out of the muck, but a dramatic return to winter-like chill early this week poses another complicating factor.\n\nIn Frankfort, the Kentucky River crested at its second-highest level on record Monday morning, just shy of 1978’s devastating flooding and worryingly close to what the city’s flood protections can handle.\n\n“I’ve heard tales about 1978,” resident Karen Kuhner told CNN affiliate WKYT. “I wasn’t here then and my heart just goes out to all of the people that aren’t able to leave and whose homes are more than likely going to be destroyed.”\n\nBuffalo Trace Distillery, which prides itself as one of the oldest continuously operating distilleries in the US, was also impacted by flooding in Frankfort from the Kentucky River, a spokesperson said. The distillery will be closed until at least Thursday and damage assessments can’t be performed until “the facilities become safe to navigate,” the spokesperson added.\n\nIn Prospect, along the Ohio River, the owners of Captain’s Quarters Riverside Grille responded to the incursion of dirty river water by deliberately flooding the restaurant with fresh water, keeping most of the silt and debris out. In a Facebook video, co-owner Andrew Masterson explained that when the flood recedes, it will be easier to clean up damage from clean water than river water.\n\n“It is a huge interruption to our business. It’s a significant cost, but we know it comes with the territory of being on the river,” Masterson told CNN on Monday.\n\nEmergency crews worked Sunday night to contain a large spill of motor oil and diesel fuel at a trucking garage outside Butler, CNN affiliate WKRC reported. Pendleton Emergency Management spokesman Rob Braun said the spill, caused by high water, was near Northern Elementary.\n\nThe rising Ohio River partially submerges the bronze statue of James Bradley along Riverside Drive, on Sunday, in Covington, Kentucky. Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nResidents of Butler and Falmouth were ordered to evacuate Saturday – anyone who stayed behind was warned their utilities could go out, and water rescuers might not be able to reach them if needed, according to CNN affiliate WCPO.\n\nSeveral Falmouth residents came to the aid of an older neighbor to help her move belongings out of her home.\n\n“Most of the people here (don’t) know the homeowner,” one of the residents told WCPO. “They just seen us back up here with the trailer and they just stop and say, ‘Can we help?’”\n\nWater rescues were carried out Sunday near Colesburg, about 30 miles south of Louisville, the county sheriff reported, as waters rose rapidly in the Rolling Fork River.\n\nExtensive flooding surrounds homes in Monterey, Kentucky, Sunday. Monterey is about 15 miles north of Frankfort and about 50 miles east of Louisville. Carson Chancellor\n\nDrone footage of nearby New Haven shows the aftermath of the river bursting its banks, flooding properties on the town’s main street with brown water. As the road leads out of town, it takes on the appearance of a causeway, fields hidden under vast quantities of water.\n\nSo many roads across Kentucky were impassable due to flooding over the weekend that the state ran out of road-closing barriers, the Hardin County sheriff said.\n\nFarther east, footage from Wilmore shows a line of homes fully surrounded by water – some with the water right up to their rooflines. Red inflatable boats are seen moving around the neighborhood on waterways above what presumably are yards and streets.\n\nEven communities far from major rivers are trying to contain damage from swollen streams. In western Kentucky, Kevin Spraggs, the top elected official in Marshall County, spent much of his weekend alongside local jail inmates filling sandbags, CNN affiliate WPSD reported.\n\n“The water’s at levels that I’ve never seen here,” Spraggs told the station. “We’ve got a couple of watersheds that we’re in fear the levees may breach.”\n\nA Canadian goose swims in the rising Ohio River at the intersection of Riverside Place and Ben Bernstein Place, Sunday, in Covington, Kentucky, across the river from Cincinnati. Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nThe Kentucky Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, the Administrative Office of the Courts in Frankfort, and Hardin County courts were closed Monday. The Franklin County courts will be closed all week.\n\nAppointments at offices to receive new driver’s licenses are being postponed, Gov. Beshear said, exactly one month before the federal government’s deadline requiring updated REAL ID-compliant licenses to board planes at domestic airports.\n\nThe Ohio River, which runs through Louisville, rose more than 5 feet in 24 hours and is expected to rise significantly higher over the next few days, Mayor Craig Greenberg said Saturday.\n\nFlooding also plagued parts of Ohio. Emergency crews rescued a woman without a home who woke up surrounded by water in downtown Cincinnati early Sunday, CNN affiliate WKRC reported.\n\nLater that day, another rescue was made after a driver ignored road closure signs by a former amusement park in the city. The driver was not injured but had to be rescued from their almost completely submerged vehicle, police told CNN affiliate WLWT. CNN reached out to the Cincinnati Police Department for comment.\n\nGov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders took an aerial tour in northern Arkansas on Monday, after their tornadoes and flooding came on the heels of dry, windy weather that sparked nearly 100 wildfires.\n\n“If there has been a natural disaster event, it has happened here in the last month,” she said.\n\nThe City of Clarksville and Montgomery County issued a joint local state of emergency after more than 118 residential properties and 14 commercial properties were impacted from recent flooding, with a third of reported damages classified as major.\n\nSevere storms along the southeast coast Monday have also caused snarls for travelers, with over 6,300 flights within, into, or out of the US delayed Monday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson airport was the hardest-hit, with nearly 50% of flights delayed as of the evening.\n\nThe storms could impact this week’s Masters golf tournament in Georgia. Augusta National Golf Club initially said the gates of the iconic venue “will not open as scheduled for Monday’s practice round,” but then reversed the decision in response to an improved forecast.\n\nCNN’s Taylor Romine, Joe Sutton, Amanda Jackson, Karina Tsui, Susannah Cullinane, Jacob Lev, Zenebou Sylla, and Zoe Sottile and CNN Meteorologist Gene Norman contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Extreme volatility sends US stocks on a roller coaster ride as Wall Street is rattled by tariffs",
    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "New York CNN —\n\nUS stocks mostly fell after an extremely volatile day Monday — tumbling, surging and then bouncing around in every direction, as traders searched for any sign that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could be negotiated or halted.\n\nMarkets around the world had tumbled earlier in the day over concerns about how Trump’s sweeping tariffs might upend the global economy and stymie economic growth. US stocks opened the day in bear market territory but surged an hour later on rumors that the Trump administration may pause tariffs — perhaps for several months.\n\nThat rumor turned out to be just that — a White House official called any suggestion that Trump would pause tariffs “fake news.” And despite signs that some trading partners, including the EU, might be willing to negotiate with Trump, the president dashed those detente hopes when he said he could slap another 50% tariff on China.\n\nAnd just like that, the Dow, which had risen nearly 900 points, was back down once again.\n\nAfter a roller coaster day, the Dow closed lower by 349 points, or 0.91%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.23%. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1% higher after fluctuating between gains and losses.\n\nWall Street’s fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, on Monday closed at the highest level since the Covid pandemic as investors fretted over the market’s next move. The VIX surpassed an intraday level of 50 points midday Monday, a rare level associated with extreme volatility.\n\nThe wild swings in markets underscore just how badly investors want Trump to put a pause on his trade war. US stocks surged off their lows on rumors of a pause on tariffs. However, that rebound proved fleeting as traders realized nothing official had been announced.\n\n“That was a good example of what would happen if we actually got some rational thought mixed in with the ignorant tariff policy,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN in a phone interview Monday. “The stock market vigilantes have spoken loudly that we need rational thought mixed in with this trade policy. And there is none so far.”\n\nHogan added that oversold markets desperate for good news are subject to wild swings that can quickly reverse.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit its low of the day at 9:43 a.m. ET and then surged on the rumor that Trump might pause tariffs, hitting its highest level of the day at 10:17 a.m. ET. In the span of just over 30 minutes, the S&P 500 surged 8.5%, a massive swing in markets. The benchmark index then shed its gains as the market came back down.\n\n“That was a monster move off the low,” Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading, told CNN.\n\nOne of the positive swings Monday came when Ursula von der Leyen, a top European Union official, said the bloc is “ready to negotiate” with the United States, noting that it has offered to scrap tariffs on US industrial goods.\n\nBut Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Monday afternoon that he is “not looking” at implementing a pause in enforcing the tariffs that he announced last week.\n\n“Well, we’re not looking at that. We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us,” Trump said. “And they’re going to be fair deals. And certain cases, they’re going to be paying substantial tariffs. They’ll be fair deals.”\n\nThe volatility in markets went beyond just stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had slid below 4% at the end of last week, rose to 4.155% as investors sold off bonds. Yields and bond prices trade in opposite directions.\n\nFlirting with a bear\n\nAt the open, the S&P 500 tumbled into bear market territory — a decline of 20% from its recent peak — before pulling back. The volatility in US stocks came after a historic rout in Asia and massive losses in Europe.\n\nWall Street is coming off a rout in US stocks Thursday and Friday that saw the Nasdaq confirm it was in a bear market. Investors may be sensing a buying opportunity. With all the recent and rapid selling, stocks are getting cheap. Some stocks are trading at a historically inexpensive multiple of 15 times future earnings projections, according to James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research. That could help markets rebound if investors believe stocks are oversold.\n\n“We are getting close to a bottom,” said Demmert. “The fact that stocks have dropped so significantly in these deep intraday moves is a clear sign of indiscriminate and fear-based selling. When this happens, we tend to soon see significant rallies.”\n\nThat could also muddy the message Wall Street has been trying to send to President Donald Trump. Market mayhem has potentially opened the door to some negotiation.\n\nIf the stock market pulls back from its extensive declines, Trump may get the message that he can hold firm and weather the market storm, some market analysts said.\n\n”We need this market to crash — to keep the pressure on the administration,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN in a stunning comment from a prominent market analyst.\n\nYardeni noted to clients earlier in the day that “Liberation Day” has been followed by “Annihilation Days” in the stock market.\n\nWorld leaders discuss approach to tariffs\n\nAs markets whipsawed Monday morning, Trump said in a social media post that he’s ready to slap new 50% tariffs on China following Beijing’s retaliatory duties announced last week, further escalating the global trade war that has rattled markets.\n\nTrump said the additional tariffs would take effect midweek if China doesn’t remove its 34% retaliatory tariff by Tuesday. He also said meetings China had requested would be cancelled, though he said other countries would begin negotiating on trade immediately.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, von der Leyen, president of the EU’s executive arm, said the bloc was ready negotiate and offered to scrap its tariffs on industrial goods. Von der Leyen said the zero-tariff offer was made “long before” Trump’s latest tariff announcement and “repeatedly, for example, in the automotive sector.” She stressed that the EU has long gone “zero for zero with other countries that also have a strong automotive sector.”\n\nAt the same time, the EU is willing to play hardball: Although it would prefer to strike a “negotiated settlement,” the bloc is also “preparing a potential list (of US imports) for retaliation,” von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels.\n\nCNN’s Fear and Greed Index slumped to its lowest level this year as tariff anxiety roiled Wall Street.\n\nAs stocks initially wavered Monday morning, Trump posted on social media that, “Countries from all over the World are talking to us.”\n\nTrump said, “Tough but fair parameters are being set,” and mentioned that he spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.\n\nIshiba urged Trump in a call on Monday to reconsider the tariffs he imposed on Japan, according to a press statement from his office.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will lead United States negotiation with Japan on trade, Bessent announced on social media on Monday.\n\nTrump, for his part, has also tried to make the case that recession fears could be a good thing. For example, US oil prices plunged below $60 for the first time since April 2021 on fears that global demand will be sapped in an economic downturn. And Treasury yields have fallen as investors have poured money into the apparent safety of government bonds. That could lower some consumer rates pegged to Treasury yields, including mortgages, credit cards and auto loans – although Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank was in no rush to lower rates.\n\n“Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,” Trump said in a social media post Monday morning.\n\nTariff uncertainty roils global markets\n\nTrump and his tariffs have taken a bull stock market and are on the cusp of turning it into a bear faster than any president has overseen in modern history.\n\nIt’s not just US markets that are taking a hit from Trump’s tariffs. Stocks around the world have declined as Trump’s tariffs rattle markets. Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 index sank 4.5% on Monday. London’s benchmark FTSE 100 index dropped 4.38%. Germany’s DAX index sank 4.13%. Italy’s benchmark stock index tumbled 5.18%.\n\nIn Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index plunged 7.83%. Hong Kong’s Hang Sang index plummeted 13.22%, its worst single trading day since 1997. Taiwan’s benchmark index sank 9.7%. The Shanghai Composite index fell 7.34% and the Shenzhen Composite index sank 9.66%.\n\nAmong the reasons for the bearish sentiment is the uncertainty the Trump administration has created regarding its inconsistent messaging about whether tariffs would be open to negotiation.\n\nOn Wednesday, America will impose significantly higher “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries that have the highest trade imbalances with the United States. In a note to investors Sunday, Goldman Sachs said that if Trump followed through with those threats, it would surely plunge the US and global economies into a recession. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in an annual letter to shareholders Monday that Trump’s tariffs would raise prices and slow economic growth.\n\nIn addition to baseline 10% universal tariffs that went into effect Saturday morning, Trump has also put in place tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum. He placed 25% tariffs on certain goods from Canada and Mexico. And more tariffs could be on their way: Tariffs on auto parts are set to go into effect no later than May 3. Meanwhile Trump has also threatened tariffs on lumber, pharmaceuticals, copper and microchips, among other products.\n\nWhether or not Trump follows through with those threats could be the determining factor in whether the economy plunges into a global downturn.\n\nIf you ask Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Trump isn’t bluffing.\n\n“The tariffs are coming. (Trump) announced it, and he wasn’t kidding,” Lutnick told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “The tariffs are coming. Of course they are.”",

Ying Tang/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nThe global market rout sparked by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs deepened in Asia and Europe on Monday, with the US bracing for a further slump when its markets open shortly.\n\nAlthough the president has doubled down on his trade policy, members of his administration failed to offer a coherent message about his strategy over the weekend. Some of Trump’s billionaire backers are now calling for a return to freer trade.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\n• Asian markets plummet: With trading now over for the day, Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng index closed 13.2% down – its worst day since 1997. The city’s financial markets had been closed Friday for an annual festival.\n\n• Europe also slumps: Stocks indexes in Europe are down around 5% halfway through the day’s trading. Meanwhile, European Union trade ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss a response to Trump’s tariffs.\n\n• US markets set to open: If the US stock market closes in bear territory – a drop of 20% from a recent peak – it would be the earliest in a new administration that a bull market has turned into a bear market in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.\n\n• Dimon sounds alarm: JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon has warned that Trump’s tariffs could raise prices, tip the global economy into recession and weaken America’s standing in the world by tearing up its alliances.\n\n• Trump doubles down: After his trade policy wiped trillions of dollars off global markets last week, Trump told reporters late Sunday that he doesn’t want “anything to go down,” but that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” On Monday morning, Trump defended his policy in a Truth Social post, saying tariffs would bring in billions of dollars in revenue.\n\n• Musk breaks rank: Elon Musk has said he would be in favor of a “zero-tariff situation” between the US and EU, after the man he helped elect as president imposed a 20% tariff on the bloc. Bill Ackman, another of Trump’s billionaire backers, has also criticized the president’s trade policy.\n\n• MAGA’s mixed signals: Top Trump administration officials offered mixed messaging over whether countries can negotiate their way out of tariffs, or if the levies are here to stay. Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary under Barack Obama, said the administration “doesn’t have a coherent message on why it’s implementing the largest tax increase” seen in the US in 50 years.",

    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nWhile many nations are scrambling to strike tariff deals with Trump, China is standing up to him, hoping to turn “crisis into opportunity.”\n\nWithin 48 hours of Trump’s market-hammering announcement of tariffs on countries across the world, the world’s second-largest economy swiftly retaliated with its own punitive measures on US goods and firms.\n\nThen, after the US president vowed to ratchet up tariffs again on Monday, Beijing once again vowed to hold the line. “The US threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake,” its Commerce Ministry said a statement.\n\nThe threat “once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the US,” the statement said. “China will never accept it. If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.”\n\nBeijing’s defiance is part of what has appeared to be a carefully calibrated confidence from a Chinese government that’s decided to position itself an oppositional force standing up to what it calls “unilateral bullying” from the US.\n\nOver the weekend, Beijing telegraphed a clear message for its domestic audience and foreign countries: China is well prepared to weather a trade war – and come out stronger on the other side.\n\n“US tariffs will have an impact (on China), but ‘the sky won’t fall,’” a commentary in the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s mouthpiece People’s Daily said Sunday.\n\n“Since the US initiated the (first) trade war in 2017 – no matter how the US fights or presses – we have continued to develop and progress, demonstrating resilience – ‘the more pressure we get, the stronger we become,’” read the commentary, which was also on the front page of the paper’s Monday edition.\n\nWith the “strong leadership” of China’s Communist Party and the country’s “institutional advantages,” China was “sure to turn crises into opportunities and move steadily into the future,” the commentary said.\n\nTrump on Wednesday unveiled an additional 34% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the US, bringing duties on all Chinese imports to the US to well over 54% when existing tariffs are taken into effect. Beijing hit back Friday with its own baseline 34% tariffs on all American imports, as well as other measures, including export controls on rare earth minerals and trade restrictions on specific US companies.\n\nOn Monday, the US president threatened to significantly ratchet up the trade war between the world’s two largest economies by slapping an additional 50% tariffs on Chinese imports midweek if Beijing doesn’t remove its retaliatory tariffs by Tuesday.\n\nThe American president also said China’s “requested meetings” with the US would be canceled.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announces global tariffs in the White House Rose Garden on April 2. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBeijing’s rhetoric in response speaks to what could be the strategic calculation of Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his cadres in Beijing: that Trump is not just using the tariffs as a negotiating tactic – and the epic disruption to global trade has the potential to hurt the US more than China.\n\n“Many (People’s Republic of China) counterparts have argued (the) US is making a mistake that will undermine its own global standing,” Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank, wrote on the social media platform X on Sunday, following meetings with government officials, scholars, business leaders during a visit to China.\n\n“There’s debate about whether the world is entering a period of blocs or a transition to an era of globalization minus the US. Beijing seems to prefer the latter scenario,” he said, adding that “China’s leaders will not countenance being seen as passive in response to US.”\n\n‘Ready to compete’\n\nAs Trump’s tariffs target friends and foe alike, Chinese officials have already in recent weeks looked to project China as an alternative champion and protector of a globalized economy that’s enhanced the prosperity of countries around the world, as well as a stable economic partner and haven for business.\n\n“As the world’s second-largest economy and the second-largest consumer market, China will only continue to open its doors wider, regardless of the changing international landscape,” China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday, Ling Ji, a vice minister at China’s Commerce Ministry, hosted representatives from 20 US-funded enterprises including Tesla and GE HealthCare, according to a ministry statement.\n\nLing touted China as an “ideal, safe, and promising” place for investment, while calling on American businesses to “be rational voices” and “take practical actions” to maintain the stability of global production and supply chains.\n\nEconomic experts speaking to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV on Saturday also played into the idea that the trade shake-up was an opportunity for Beijing.\n\n“China is sending a significant message to the world: we cannot back down or tolerate US bullying, as tolerance ultimately leads to more bullying,” said Liu Zhiqin, senior researcher at Chongyang Institute for Finance Studies in Renmin University of China, told the broadcaster.\n\n“China and the US are now direct rivals in reshaping the international trade order,” said another, Ju Jiandong, a professor at the People’s Bank of China School of Finance of Tsinghua University. “We’re willing to take on the challenge – we’re ready to compete with the US in redefining the new global trade system.”\n\nChina’s trade partners are likely to take such messaging with a grain of salt.\n\nBeijing is well known to have wielded access to its massive market as a weapon to coerce countries, often over political stances that sparked Beijing’s ire. Many will also be looking warily at whether Chinese exports will flood their own markets, hurting their own domestic production or driving down consumer prices.\n\nBut countries may have little choice but to look to strengthen ties with China if US tariffs, which hit American allies as well as rivals, become the new normal.\n\nBeijing over the past month held economic talks with Japan and South Korea, hit last week with 24% and 25% tariffs respectively, as well as with the European Union, which was slapped with 20% duties.\n\nMany Southeast Asian economies – key manufacturing hubs for companies looking to diversify away from China – have been hit particularly hard by Trump’s tariff war. While few want to pick a fight with Washington publicly, the region is rattled.\n\nIn Singapore, an ultra-connected free trade bastion known for treading a cautious diplomatic line, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong pulled few punches in a message to his fellow citizens over the weekend.\n\n“The recent ‘Liberation Day’ announcement by the US leaves little room for doubt,” he said. “It marks a seismic change in the global order. The era of rules-based globalization and free trade is over. We are entering a new phase, one that is more arbitrary, protectionist and dangerous.”\n\nDomestic challenges\n\nAn electronic board in a brokerage house window in Beijing displays a trading index on Monday. Andy Wong/AP\n\nChina, however, is still bracing for impact – and what could be an extended period of escalation between the two governments and their leaders.\n\nXi’s defiance risks “locking both leaders into an escalation spiral. No high-level diplomacy means no safety valve – the longer this drags, the harder it becomes for either side to de-escalate without losing face,” Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the US-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said last week.\n\nLast year, US-China totaled roughly half a trillion in trade, and the tariffs come as China has been seeing some glimmers of economic vitality following years grappling with a property sector crisis, high local government debt and the fallout from Beijing’s pandemic controls.\n\nThe Chinese government last month announced a slew of measures to rev up domestic consumption as it anticipated the hit to its export-powered growth.\n\nNow, China would “vigorously boost domestic consumption with extraordinary efforts … and introduce a series of reserve policies as appropriate,” according to the People’s Daily Sunday commentary.\n\nUnlike in many other countries, however, how the Chinese Communist Party’s navigates these challenges – and its tolerance for economic pain – will not be judged by opinion polls or an electorate that can vote it out of power for how it navigates the challenge.\n\nAnd in the shadow of Trump’s latest threat, the question of just how far – and fast – the trade war between the two largest economies could escalate looms even larger, with both governments still holding a number of options for how to ratchet penalties higher.\n\nAnd the more they do, the more difficult it may be for the world’s two largest economies to find a way out.",

    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "CNN —\n\nA federal judge in Texas on Monday nixed a controversial Biden administration rule that would have required nursing homes to boost their nursing staff in coming years.\n\nUS District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk noted that staffing and other deficiencies at nursing homes “deserve an effectual response. But any regulatory response must be consistent with Congress’s legislation governing nursing homes.”\n\n“Though rooted in laudable goals, the Final Rule still must be consistent with Congress’s statutes,” wrote Kacsmaryk, an appointee of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Biden administration finalized the first-ever minimum staffing regulation for nursing homes last April. The mandate, which would have required facilities to hire more registered nurses and nurse aides, was quickly challenged in court by nursing home operators and their trade associations. Nursing homes already struggle to fill open positions, they said.\n\n“This unrealistic staffing mandate threatened to close nursing homes and displace vulnerable seniors,” Clif Porter, CEO of American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in a statement.\n\nMeeting the proposed mandate would have required nursing homes to hire more than 100,000 additional nurses and nurse aides at an annual cost of $6.8 billion, according to the association’s 2023 analysis.\n\nNursing home trade groups have pushed Congress to improve funding for nursing home care, which is mainly provided through Medicaid. The staffing rule, they noted, did not provide any support for recruitment and training of nursing staff.\n\n“Our stance has always been clear: imposing mandates rather than addressing funding adequacy and workforce sufficiency is wrong-headed,” Katie Smith Sloan, CEO of LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit providers of aging services and was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a statement.\n\nThe staffing mandate had also raised bipartisan concerns in Congress. A bipartisan Senate bill and similar legislation introduced by House Republicans would have prohibited the Department of Health and Human Services from finalizing the proposed rule. Nearly a hundred House members from both parties wrote a letter to then-Health Secretary Xavier Becerra expressing their concerns with the proposed rule, particularly that it could lead to widespread nursing home closures.\n\nThe rule called for all nursing homes that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding to provide a total of at least 3.48 hours of nursing care per resident per day. Plus, nursing homes would have had to have a registered nurse onsite at all times. The mandate would have been phased in over three years, with rural communities having up to five years.\n\nSome 75% of nursing homes would have had to hire staff, HHS said when it finalized the rule.\n\nThe agency did not immediately return a request for comment about the judge’s decision.",

    "content": "New York CNN —\n\nAn errant post on X may have just shaken the stock market, showing how influential — and unreliable — the social media platform can be.\n\nUnsourced “headlines” about a potential “90-day pause in tariffs” sent markets into a state of turbulence Monday morning as investors sought any indication of a reprieve from the Trump administration’s new levies. The problem: It wasn’t true. The White House swiftly denied the rumor shortly after it began to circulate online.\n\nThe false posts may have originated from a real Fox News interview with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett at around 8:30 a.m. ET. Hassett was asked whether President Donald Trump would “consider a 90-day pause in tariffs,” and he replied in part: “The president is (going to) decide what the president is (going to) decide.”\n\nAccording to CNN’s analysis, the first X post to claim Hassett said Trump would consider a 90-day pause in tariffs came at 10:11 a.m. ET from an account called “Hammer Capital” with the handle “yourfavorito,” which has barely 1,000 followers.\n\nAt about 10:12 a.m., CNN’s Vanessa Yurkevich, who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, said that cheers had broken out, as stock indices — which were already recovering from early-morning lows — suddenly surged.\n\n“Walter Bloomberg,” an account with a much larger following that uses the handle “DeItaone” copy-and-pasted the original rumor along with a siren emoji at 10:13 a.m.\n\nOn CNBC, anchors were seemingly baffled, wondering what was causing the turnaround.\n\nCNBC anchor David Faber and his network colleagues wondered aloud about the triggering “headline,” searching their computer screens for a wire service alert or any other indication of what could have caused stock market movements.\n\nBy 10:15 a.m., CNBC anchors were reading the news on air.\n\n“I think we can go with this headline, apparently Hassett’s been saying Trump will consider a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except for China,” anchor Carl Quintanilla said.\n\n“We’re trying to source that exactly in terms of where that’s coming from,” Faber quickly added. CNBC showed the “headline” on screen less than a minute later.\n\n“HASSETT: TRUMP IS CONSIDERING A 90-DAY PAUSE IN TARIFFS FOR ALL COUNTRIES EXPECT CHINA,” the CNBC banner read, as if the news was confirmed.\n\nBy 10:19, Reuters alerted the supposed comments, citing CNBC.\n\nStocks would later decline as the White House firmly denied the supposed headline. CNBC reporters quickly reported the White House denial, and Reuters updated its stories, later issuing an advisory at 12:28 p.m. withdrawing the original alert along with a statement that the newswire service “regrets its error.”\n\nThe “Walter Bloomberg” account appears to borrow its name from the Bloomberg financial news service to gain credibility. The account, which has more than 800,000 followers, often posts accurate news flashes from Bloomberg, Reuters and other outlets. “Hammer Capital” also posts headlines, as well as stock market memes.\n\nBoth that account and “Hammer Capital” do not publicize their real identities. Both have blue checkmarks on X, which used to indicate the account holder’s identity had been verified. But when Musk took over the service formerly known as Twitter, he turned the blue checkmark into a paid service, meaning anyone could pay to appear verified and have their posts boosted on others’ timelines.\n\nOnce the financial damage was done, “Walter Bloomberg” deleted the post, claiming they first saw it on Reuters, and market participants were left wondering what just happened. “Hammer Capital” said on X they first saw the news on Reuters and CNBC, although Reuters’ flash was at 10:19 a.m., sourced to CNBC.\n\nA CNBC spokesperson said in a statement: “As we were chasing the news of the market moves in real-time, we aired unconfirmed information in a banner. Our reporters quickly made a correction on air.”\n\n“Hammer Capital” denied making up the headline: “To be as abundantly clear as possible, trading desks started sending out this headline at 10:09. I was regurgitating what the market was reacting to, to my 600 followers. It was an incorrect interpretation of a Fox News interview,” they posted on Monday afternoon.\n\nWherever the original source of the incorrect headline came from, it was amplified by trusted sources in financial news, creating a very expensive lesson in the value of accurate and reliable reporting.",

    "title": "Supreme Court pauses midnight deadline to return man mistakenly deported to El Salvador",
    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday temporarily paused a court-imposed midnight deadline to return to the US a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, agreeing to a request from President Donald Trump that will give the justices more time to consider the case.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts granted the “administrative stay,” a move that will extend the deadline until the court hands down a more fulsome decision in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was deported on March 15.\n\nThe decision to temporarily pause the case, which is relatively common when the court is facing a quick deadline, means that Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, will remain at a notorious prison in El Salvador for now. A lower court judge had given the administration until midnight to return him to the US.\n\nRoberts did not set a new deadline, though the court is likely to move relatively quickly. The chief justice ordered Abrego Garcia’s attorneys to respond by Tuesday, though they had already done so minutes before Roberts’ order was made public.\n\n“This is just a temporary administrative stay. We have every confidence that the Supreme Court will resolve this matter as quickly as possible,” Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s attorney, said after the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\nTrump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three “because of an administrative error,” but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. Abrego Garcia’s case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over White House efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review.\n\nThe Justice Department told the Supreme Court that ordering officials to return the man is “unprecedented” as it sounded now-familiar themes arguing federal courts are overstepping their power.\n\n“Even amidst a deluge of unlawful injunctions, this order is remarkable,” recently confirmed Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court in the filing Monday. “The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal.”\n\n“While the United States concedes that removal to El Salvador was an administrative error … that does not license district courts to seize control over foreign relations, treat the executive branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight,” Sauer added.\n\nAbrego Garcia rejected that position in his own written arguments Monday.\n\n“There is no dispute that Abrego Garcia is only in El Salvador because the United States sent him there,” his attorneys told the Supreme Court. “There is likewise no dispute that he is being held only because the United States has requested that he be held. And there is no evidence in the record of this case supporting the government’s contention that it cannot bring him back.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s “contention that he has suddenly morphed into a dangerous threat to the republic is not credible,” Abrego Garcia’s attorneys wrote. “The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny.”\n\nAbrego Garcia was in the country illegally, but an immigration judge in 2019 — after reviewing evidence — withheld his removal. That meant that Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been “targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family’s pupusa business.”\n\nThe Trump administration has claimed that Abrego Garcia is a “ranking member” of the MS-13 gang. Because the Trump administration designated MS-13 as a foreign terrorist organization, Sauer wrote, the withholding from the immigration court was no longer enforceable.\n\nThe administration alleges that Abrego Garcia was arrested “in the company of other ranking gang members” and that he was confirmed to be a member of the gang by a “reliable source.”\n\nBut in the six years between his immigration hearing and his deportation, Abrego Garcia checked in with immigration officials annually and was never charged with a crime, court records show.\n\nYet Abrego Garcia was placed on one of three planes bound for a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. Several of the people loaded onto those planes were deported under Trump’s invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act — an invocation that has drawn its own legal challenge now pending at the Supreme Court. But Abrego Garcia, the administration has said, was deported under different authorities.\n\nOn Friday, US District Judge Paula Xinis explained in an opinion why she had ordered the government to return Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nWhite House officials have publicly mocked the judge’s order and assert they have no ability to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.\n\n“Marxist judge now thinks she’s president of El Salvador,” Trump adviser Stephen Miller posted to social media Friday.\n\nBut under oath, the Justice Department has been far less clear about the removal. Pressed by Xinis last week about why the US couldn’t return Abrego Garcia, DOJ lawyer Erez Reuveni said he didn’t have an answer.\n\n“The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,” Reuveni responded.\n\nThe Department of Justice has since placed Reuveni and his supervisor on leave.\n\nAppeals court declines to block order\n\nThe request to the Supreme Court came minutes before a ruling from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals denying the Justice Department’s request to lift the lower-court order.\n\nThe panel rejecting the appeal was: Judge Stephanie Thacker, an appointee of former President Barack Obama; Judge Harvie Wilkinson III, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Robert King, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Stefania Vasquez Sura, said before the high court’s decision that the appeals ruling gave her “hope” and “encouragement.”\n\n“This decision gives me hope, and even more encouragement to keep fighting. My children, family, and I will continue praying and seeking justice. Now that the court has spoken, I ask again that both President Trump and President Bukele stop attempting any further delays,” she said, referring to Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador. “They need to follow the court’s order NOW. My children are waiting to be reunited with their father tonight.”\n\nThacker wrote in a scathing concurrence explaining her reasoning that the “United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process.”\n\n“The Government’s contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable,” she wrote, adding later that the “irreparable harm in this case is the harm being done to Abrego Garcia every minute he is in El Salvador.”\n\n“And the public interest undoubtedly favors requiring the Government to facilitate and effectuate his return to the United States,” she added.\n\nIn a solo concurrence explaining his reasoning, Wilkinson said he thinks it is “legitimate for the district court to require that the government ‘facilitate’ the plaintiff’s return to the United States so that he may assert the rights that all apparently agree are due him under law.”\n\n“There is no question that the government screwed up here,” he continued. “Thus the government here took the only action which was expressly prohibited.”\n\nBut Wilkinson said he read Xinis’ order “as one requiring that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release, rather than demand it.” He said that reading it as a requirement for the administration “would be an intrusion on core executive powers that goes too far.”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

    "title": "HHS, EPA to study fluoride in drinking water as RFK Jr. says he’ll tell CDC to stop recommending it",
    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "CNN —\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said Monday that it is reconvening the Community Preventative Services Task Force, an independent panel of public health and prevention experts, “to study and make a new recommendation on fluoride.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also told the Associated Press on Monday that he will soon tell the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation for drinking water in communities.\n\nAnd US Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced Monday that the EPA will expeditiously review scientific information on the “potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.”\n\n“Without prejudging any outcomes, when this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency’s future steps,” he said in a statement.\n\nAlthough the CDC makes recommendations, it is the EPA that sets the limits on what is allowed in water and makes recommendations under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nOn Monday, Kennedy and Zeldin visited Utah, which in March banned municipal drinking water systems from adding fluoride, starting in May.\n\n“I think it’s a moral imperative that we all believe in freedom of choice in this country,” Kennedy said. “It is one of the bedrock principles of our democracy, and the government shouldn’t be making decisions, intimate decisions about our own lives.”\n\nLawmakers in states including Ohio, South Carolina and Florida have also proposed restrictions on fluoridated water.\n\n“As dentists, we see the direct consequences fluoride removal has on our patients and it’s a real tragedy when policymakers’ decisions hurt vulnerable kids and adults in the long term,” Dr. Brett Kessler, president of the American Dental Association, said in a statement Monday. “Blindly calling for a ban on fluoridated water hurts people, costs money, and will ultimately harm our economy. We see on a daily basis the benefits of fluoride, from both drinking fluoridated water and topically in products like fluoride toothpaste and other dental products, so we know the need for both exists.”\n\nDr. Darren Chamberlain, a pediatric dentist who is on the board of directors for the Utah Dental Association, said he operated Monday morning on patients who had 12 and 14 cavities.\n\n“I’m nervous that that’s going to be the future in Utah, and I did this at Medicaid’s expense, and it was thousands of dollars to be able to do that. So I hope that they have the funds to be able to help out children, because we will see more of these circumstances,” he said. “I feel for the children that are going to be affected by this.”\n\nFluoridation of public water systems has long been considered one of the most successful public health advances of the 20th century. Municipalities across the country have been adding fluoride to water since about the 1940s, after scientists noticed that people who got water in places with high rates of naturally occurring fluoride had fewer cavities.\n\nThe CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Dental Association support the use of fluoride as an effective and safe way to maintain dental health.\n\nAdding this naturally occurring mineral to drinking water is the most cost-effective way to strengthen teeth, the CDC says, protecting them from normal wear and tear as well as cavities, particularly among children. In some cases, it may be the only oral health protection a family has access to if they can’t afford regular trips to a dentist.\n\nThe CDC calls cavities the most common chronic disease of childhood in the United States, and Kennedy has said that chronic conditions are his primary concern. But the HHS secretary has also said he wants the country to remove fluoride from its water systems because of concerns about its health risks.\n\nOn the campaign trail last fall, Kennedy called fluoride “industrial waste” and claimed that exposure has resulted in a wide variety of health problems, including cancer. The American Cancer Society and the CDC have disagreed, pointing out that most studies of people living in areas with fluoridated water did not find an association between fluoride and cancer risk, although many also call for additional research.\n\nZeldin cited Kennedy’s advocacy on fluoride as one of the main reasons he was calling for the scientific review.\n\n“As soon as I was nominated by President Trump as administrator of the EPA, the secretary instantly reached out to start talking about issues that he is so passionate about, and number one on that list was fluoride,” Zeldin said Monday.\n\nThe newly announced scientific review that the EPA will conduct along with HHS is centered around a report that the National Toxicology Program released in August, concluding that higher levels of fluoride – above 1.5 milligrams per liter – are linked to lowered IQ in children.\n\n“These studies used research from areas outside of the US with high naturally occurring fluoride and did not find an association between fluoride and IQ at low levels,” the American Dental Association said in its statement. “The authors of the report clearly state that their findings do not pertain to the practice of fluoridation in the U.S. and Canada with levels at 0.7 mg/L.”\n\nThe EPA has committed to a “thorough review of these findings and additional peer reviewed studies,” the agency said Monday.\n\nIn September, a federal judge ordered the EPA to take additional steps to regulate fluoride because a handful of other studies have found a possible link between exposure to high levels of fluoride and children’s intellectual development.\n\nA separate recent report from the Cochrane Collaboration, an independent group that systematically analyzes scientific research, found just a slight benefit in adding fluoride to tap water, leading to slightly fewer cavities in children’s baby teeth. It tempers the scale of the positive effects of adding fluoride to public water.\n\nFluoride is used in public drinking water systems supplied to three-quarters of Americans, according to the CDC.\n\nThe American Dental Association says that fluoridation continues to be effective in reducing dental decay by at least 25% in kids and adults, even when there are alternative ways for people to get it, such as toothpaste.\n\nIn Utah, lawmakers and voters have gone back and forth on the benefits of adding fluoride to water. In 1976, voters passed a ballot initiative that prohibited the State Board of Health from mandating the addition of fluoride or other medicines to public water supplies and required local voters to pass an initiative to add them.\n\nHealth concerns weren’t the only reason for the ban, however; rather, some voters believed claims that fluoridation was part of a communist plot against the country.\n\nIn 2000, Salt Lake County voters were the first in Utah to vote to add fluoride to their water. Fluoridation began in 2003, and other counties soon followed, but the number of people who drink fluoridated water in Utah is still low compared with other states.\n\nIn 2022, the CDC found that only about 44% of Utah residents had access to fluoridated water systems, with Utah ranking 44th among US states. By comparison, all drinking water in the in Washington area is fluoridated. In Kentucky, it is for 99.7% of the population.\n\nMore recently, some anti-fluoride advocates in Utah have said that adding fluoride to water was too expensive, while others argued about its effects on health. The American Dental Association sent letters to lawmakers to protest the ban, and some municipalities also fought it.\n\nSalt Lake County has argued that removing fluoride from the drinking water will be expensive for local families.\n\nThe county Health Department told CNN on Monday that it supports community water fluoridation as a “safe, proven, and efficient way to improve oral health communitywide regardless of income level or access to regular dental care.”\n\nThe department said it is preparing educational information to let families know that when fluoride is removed from their water, they will need to provide fluoride supplements for their children to replace the benefits.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends that children between the ages of 6 months and 16 years who are at high risk of cavities get some form of fluoride every day.\n\nAlthough water fluoridation is thought to save an average of $32 per person a year by avoiding the need for cavity treatment, Salt Lake County said, having to add supplements to a child’s daily routine will collectively cost families at least $284,000 – and not all families will be able to afford the supplements.\n\nEnding fluoridation has had negative effects in some places. A 2019 study in Juneau, Alaska, found that children without access to fluoride in their drinking water also had more dental-related procedures.\n\nCalgary, Alberta, stopped putting fluoride in its water in 2011, and a study found that children there had more cavities than those in cities that kept fluoride. Calgary will resume fluoridation this year.\n\n“Maybe we should be happy at some level that the EPA is looking into this, because we definitely know from the 80 years of fluoridating water in the United States that it is effective,” Chamberlain said. “In practice, we definitely see a significant difference between people who live in fluoridated and nonfluoridated communities.”\n\nCNN’s Meg Tirrell, Nadia Kounang and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

    "content": "CNN —\n\nWhen paramedic Hassan Hosni Al-Hila felt too sick to continue his late-night assignment with the Palestine Red Crescent Society on March 23, his son gladly agreed to cover his shift.\n\nThat shift would prove to be 21-year-old Mohammad’s last.\n\nWithin a few hours, while the young paramedic was dispatched with a convoy of emergency vehicles to find a missing ambulance crew in Rafah, southern Gaza, Mohammad called his father pleading for help amidst intense Israeli military gunfire.\n\n“’Come to me, Dad, help me… we were targeted by the Israelis, and they are now shooting at us directly,” Al-Hila recalled his son telling him over the phone. “The call ended after that.”\n\nHis fate would remain unknown for over a week, until rescue teams granted permission by the Israeli military to access the area uncovered a horrific scene: a mass grave containing the bodies of 15 first responders buried along with their crushed emergency vehicles.\n\nA growing trove of evidence detailing the final moments of the first responders has blown apart the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) initial narrative of what unfolded that day, in which it claimed without offering evidence that some vehicles were moving suspiciously without headlights or flashing lights toward the Israeli troops and that members of the emergency teams were militants.\n\nA CNN review of video capturing the gunfire, photos and satellite imagery of the site, along with interviews with forensic experts and family members provides a detailed account of the Israeli military’s targeting and burial of clearly marked rescue crews from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, Civil Defense, and the United Nations. A CNN interview with a survivor of the attack and exclusive audio from a medical worker recorded in his final moments also contradict Israel’s account.\n\nOn Sunday, March 30, a complex, week-long rescue operation concluded with the recovery of the bodies of 15 first responders: eight from the Palestine Red Crescent Society, six from the Palestinian Civil Defense and one from the United Nations. OCHA\n\nThe IDF said it had begun re-investigating the incident after footage emerged Friday showing ambulances and a fire truck traveling with their emergency signal lights on. After being briefed on the preliminary inquiry, the IDF Chief of Staff on Monday ordered the initial inquiry be “pursued in greater depth” through an “investigation mechanism” and completed within days. The video, first published by The New York Times, was obtained by CNN from the PRCS.\n\n“All the claims raised regarding the incident will be examined through the mechanism and presented in a detailed and thorough manner for a decision on how to handle the event,” the IDF said in a statement Monday.\n\nAccording to an Israeli military official, troops from a brigade that had set up an ambush opened fire on the emergency crews that morning, after intelligence had deemed their movements “suspicious,” and believed they had successfully carried out an attack on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants.\n\nFamily members and colleagues of the slain paramedics vehemently deny that any of the workers were militants and are calling for an independent investigation into the killings.\n\nOn seeing his son’s body, which Hosni said was riddled with bullet holes, he apologized for not being beside him in his final moments, saying their ambulances would have been dispatched together.\n\n“I told him, ‘I’m sorry I couldn’t join you,’” Hosni recalls. “If I hadn’t returned home, [he] and I would have been together on the same mission.”\n\n‘The gasp of death’\n\nThe chain of events began in the early hours of Sunday, March 23, following reports of an Israeli strike in Rafah. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) dispatched an ambulance with three crew members to respond to the scene.\n\nPRCS said they did not coordinate the dispatch with COGAT, the Israeli military agency overseeing activities in the Palestinian territories, because the area was not designated as a “red zone” where coordination is required. Hours after the attack, the IDF designated the area as a “red zone” as part of its expanded operation in Rafah.\n\nAccording to PRCS medic Munther Abed – who was sitting in the back of the ambulance en route to the scene – the crew was suddenly targeted with heavy, direct gunfire by Israeli forces. Abed said he survived the attack by throwing himself to the floor of the vehicle for cover, hearing the pained yells of his colleagues in the front, both of whom were killed.\n\n“I couldn’t hear anything from my colleagues except the sound of death, the gasp of death, their last breath,” Abed told CNN. “A cry of pain, that’s all I heard from them.”\n\nThe ambulance crashed into a power pole, coming to a stop along with the gunfire, according to Abed. He said Israeli soldiers opened the back doors of the vehicle and detained him outside, stripping him down to his underwear.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the troops shot at a vehicle at 4 a.m., killing two individuals and detaining another, all of whom the IDF claimed without providing evidence were Hamas security officials. The official also denied that the vehicle was an ambulance or that the individuals were uniformed paramedics. Abed, who said he was released later that day from Israeli custody after the military checked his records, rejects those claims.\n\nOnce communication with Abed’s crew was lost, PRCS dispatched additional ambulances alongside Civil Defense vehicles to check on the missing team.\n\nHowever, the support crews would meet the same, grim fate. A newly released video discovered on the phone of one of the 15 deceased ambulance and relief team members captured their final moments before being killed by the Israeli military.\n\nThe video is filmed from the front of a vehicle and shows a convoy of clearly marked ambulances moving along a road at dawn, with headlights and flashing emergency lights on.\n\nThis frame from a video released by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society shows emergency vehicles seconds before they came under a barrage of gunfire from Israeli soldiers near the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood of Rafah, in southern Gaza, on Sunday, March 23. Palestinian Red Crescent Society/AP\n\nThe video shows the convoy stopping when it comes across another vehicle that had seemingly crashed into a power pole on the side of the road. Dr. Younis Al-Khatib, president of the PRCS, confirmed in a press briefing on Monday that the vehicle seen in the footage was one of the agency’s ambulances.\n\nTwo of the rescuers seen in the footage getting out of the vehicles are wearing reflective, PRCS emergency responder uniforms. A fire truck and an ambulance at the scene are marked with the PRCS insignia.\n\nAlmost immediately there is intense gunfire, which can be heard hitting the convoy. The video ends, but the audio continues for five minutes.\n\nTrevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member, told CNN that the gunfire heard in the footage was consistent with small arms and light weapons. “Even while using night vision the lights from the vehicles in the convoy would be noticeable,” he added.\n\nThe paramedic filming the incident, identified by the PRCS as Rifaat Radwan, is heard repeatedly saying the “shahada,” which Muslims recite when facing death, and says he knows he is going to die.\n\nAt one point he says: “Forgive me mom, this is the path I chose – to help people – I swear I didn’t choose this path but to help people.”\n\nThe voices of others in the convoy can also be heard, as well as those of people shouting commands in Hebrew. It’s unclear who they are or what they are saying.\n\nAnother medic who was on the second dispatch, Ashraf Abu Libda, made a call at 4:55 a.m. to a colleague as the convoy came under fire. An audio recording of the call, obtained by CNN, captures him repeating the shahada before saying “there are soldiers, there are soldiers here.” A soldier can be heard in the background, saying “come, come, come” in Hebrew.\n\nThe call casts doubt over the timeline laid out by the Israeli soldiers involved in the attack, who said the rescue convoy arrived two hours after the initial ambulance, at 6 a.m., according to the Israeli military official. The video also shows the convoy arriving in darkness, with the first rays of sunlight visible on the horizon, indicating it was filmed before 6 a.m. – sunrise on March 23 in Gaza was at 5:42 a.m.\n\nFollowing the deadly attacks, Abed – who told CNN he was beaten and abused by Israeli soldiers during interrogations near the scene – said he witnessed the IDF’s burial of the bodies and vehicles, seeing bulldozers dig a large pit, crush the vehicles and pile them into the hole.\n\nAn Israeli military official told CNN last week that Israeli forces buried the bodies of the workers because they expected it would take time to coordinate their retrieval with the PRCS and the UN, and they wanted to prevent the bodies being eaten by animals. One forensic expert who reviewed images of the badly damaged bodies said that their state of decomposition suggested they may have been scavenged on by dogs.\n\nSatellite imagery from March 23, first published by Al Jazeera Arabic and analyzed by CNN, shows Israeli army vehicles surrounding a cluster of five ambulances from the PRCS and Civil Defense. Bulldozer tracks and activity are clearly visible in the image.\n\nAnother satellite image, also published by Al Jazeera and analyzed by CNN, dated March 25, shows an Israeli tank, an excavator, and military bulldozers at the same location. Where the ambulances once stood, remnants of vehicles protruded from disturbed ground.\n\nBall told CNN that images of the excavation point to a direct gunfire attack and crushing by heavily armored vehicles. “There are some visible bullet holes in the fire truck, and the damage to the fire truck and UN vehicle looks more consistent with heavy vehicles,” he added.\n\nAn IDF forward-operating base and staging area at an unfinished hospital in Tal al-Sultan, about 1 kilometer from the site of the mass grave, is visible in satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Ball said tracks from heavy vehicles can be seen between the base and grave site, adding that the military would have had a clear line of sight to where the bodies and vehicles were buried.\n\nThe IDF claimed on April 1 without offering proof that “following an initial assessment, it was determined that the forces had eliminated a Hamas military operative, Mohammad Amin Ibrahim Shubaki, who took part in the October 7 massacre, along with 8 other terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.”\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the IDF revised that number, saying six Hamas operatives were identified among the casualties, without providing evidence.\n\nBut the aid agencies said the name given by the Israeli military did not match that of any emergency workers dispatched, and no Hamas militants were among the group. CNN obtained from the PRCS the names of 14 of those killed; none was identified as Mohammad Shubaki. A spokesperson with the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA said the name of the 15th man killed – an UNRWA employee – was not shared out of respect for his family but was not the name given by the Israeli military.\n\nAbed told CNN he does not know anybody by the name Shubaki, nor had he heard it before.\n\nThe mass grave\n\nOver the course of the next several days, PRCS and UN personnel negotiated permission from the Israeli military to visit the area on several occasions. It would be a week later that a convoy consisting of PRCS, Civil Defense, and UN OCHA crews unearthed the mass grave.\n\nThe operation recovered a total of 15 bodies: eight members of PRCS, six from Civil Defense, and one UNRWA employee. Photos and videos of the excavation reviewed by CNN and forensic experts offer clues as to the crews’ visibility as first responders in their final moments.\n\nOne PRCS medic from the convoy, Asaad Al-Nassasrah, remains missing and the organization has demanded information about his whereabouts from the Israeli military. CNN has also asked the IDF for more information about the missing medic.\n\nSome of the PRCS paramedics pictured in photos were buried in their uniforms emblazoned with the group’s emblem and reflective stripes. Others were still wearing their blue latex gloves, indicating that they were on duty and prepared to respond to distress calls. The bodies were mixed with mangled fragments of the crushed emergency vehicles, under mounds of sand, footage shared by UN OCHA of the exhumation shows.\n\nA UN OCHA crew digs through sand searching for bodies amidst the wreckage of emergency vehicles at the site of the mass grave in Rafah. OCHA\n\n“They were buried in their uniforms with their gloves on, they were ready to save lives, and they ended up in a mass grave,” Jonathan Whittall, the head of UN OCHA in the occupied Palestinian territories, said in a press briefing last week.\n\nA forensic pathologist examining the bodies of the emergency responders told CNN that their autopsies had shown bullet wounds.\n\nThe deaths have sparked international condemnation, and the emergence of the footage prompted the IDF to re-investigate the killings.\n\nThe findings of the IDF’s preliminary investigation included information from Israeli aerial surveillance video that has not been made public, an Israeli military official told CNN on Saturday.\n\nAccording to the military official, troops from the Golani infantry brigade had set up an ambush along a road in the early hours of March 23, opening fire in two instances on vehicles arriving in the area.\n\nSoldiers were told by drone operators that the vehicles in the convoy were advancing “in a suspicious manner,” the military official said, adding that soldiers involved in the attack claimed to investigators that they opened fire after being surprised by the convoy stopping on the side of the road and by individuals getting out of their vehicles quickly.\n\nAfter seeing the bodies of more than a dozen uniformed emergency responders on the ground, the troops said they still believed they had successfully carried out the attack following efforts to verify the identities of some of the deceased, the military official said.\n\nPRCS president Al-Khatib has demanded an independent investigation into the matter.\n\n“We don’t trust any of the army investigations and this is why we were very clear in saying that we need an independent inquiry into this,” Al-Khatib said in a UN press conference.\n\nFirst responders under attack\n\nFor Saleh Muammar – one of the PRCS paramedics killed and buried in the mass grave – this was not the first time he had been shot while on duty, according to his wife Hadeel.\n\nTwo months earlier, Saleh was shot in the chest by the IDF, Hadeel told CNN in an interview. She said that he survived the attack, getting “a new lease on life” and returned to work as a paramedic.\n\n“We bade him farewell every time he left, we expected that he would be martyred,” Hadeel said. “I felt that he would leave this world because the nature of his work is full of risks.”\n\nInternational aid and humanitarian organizations have repeatedly condemned the Israeli military’s attacks on medical facilities and personnel.\n\nThe bodies of Palestinian first responders killed in the Israeli attack were taken to the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, Gaza, for autopsies. The photo, taken on Monday, March 30, shows images of some of the PRCS workers on body bags. AFP/Getty Images\n\nMore than 400 aid workers have been killed in Israeli attacks in the enclave since October 7, 2023, according to OCHA’s latest update released last week. The PRCS says the number of its staff killed in line of duty by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 2023 has now reached 27.\n\n“The occupation’s targeting of Red Crescent medics … can only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world,” PCRS said.",

    "title": "‘Amazing’ reduction in Alzheimer’s risk verified by blood markers, study says",
    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "Editor’s note: CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta and writer Sandee LaMotte are part of the study covered in this story and have written about their experiences.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen Penny Ashford’s father was diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease at age 62, she knew the devastating brain disorder might one day steal her memory. In her late 50s, her free-floating anxiety turned to outright panic when she began struggling to find words.\n\n“I couldn’t tell a story. I couldn’t get my words out,” said Ashford, now 61. “I remember sitting at a dinner party one time, and I couldn’t finish my thoughts. It was the most unbelievable moment.\n\n“I came home and sobbed and told my husband, ‘Something is wrong with me. I can’t talk,’” she said. “I was petrified.”\n\nPenny Ashford's father Barry Murphy, 75, blows out his candles while granddaughters look on. Courtesy Penny Ashford\n\nToday, after a complete revamp of her lifestyle and overall health, Ashford’s struggles with retrieving words have eased, while measures of amyloid and tau proteins and neuroinflammation — all hallmark signs of Alzheimer’s — have fallen.\n\nAshford knows about these improvements because she’s part of a unique study tracking her progress via key blood biomarkers now being used to help diagnose early dementia. Instead of relying on painful spinal taps and expensive brain scans, these blood tests are heralded as a new, less invasive and time-consuming way to determine risk and aid in an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.\n\nThe preliminary data, presented Monday at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in San Diego, analyzed biomarkers on 54 participants in an ongoing preventive neurology study called the Biorepository Study for Neurodegenerative Diseases, or BioRAND.\n\n“The field is primarily using various biomarkers to determine if you have dementia or not,” said lead study author Dr. Kellyann Niotis, a preventive neurologist who researches risk reduction for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\n“No one is really looking at the changes in these biomarkers as outcome measures, as a way of tracking progress in a person’s journey to improve their brain,” Niotis said. “We believe these biomarkers may show how the disease progression is being modified biologically by a person’s actions.”\n\nLess invasive test for Alzheimer’s risk\n\nAlzheimer’s blood tests are the key to widespread prevention of dementia, experts say. If people can be diagnosed in their doctor’s office, they can more immediately move into preventive care and implement lifestyle changes designed to slow the progression of their disease.\n\nThe problem, said senior study author Dr. Richard Isaacson, is the variability in how well these new blood biomarker tests work to predict or track disease progression.\n\n“There is a dirty little secret in the Alzheimer’s blood testing community where so many testing platforms, biotech companies, and a flurry of new blood tests are released,” Isaacson said, “but it’s unclear which of these tests are most accurate to track progression and evaluate response to therapies to slow progression toward dementia.”\n\nTo address this gap, Isaacson’s research team and collaborators at five sites across the United States and Canada set forth to evaluate and eventually cross-compare the clinical use of what the neurologist said he believes will one day become “the cholesterol test for the brain.”\n\n“In the not so far future, people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond will get a baseline test to evaluate risk and help track progress over time — similar to how traditional cholesterol tests are used today,” said Isaacson, founder of one of the first Alzheimer’s prevention clinics in the United States.\n\n“Our eventual goal is to offer a blood panel at cost to help democratize access and broaden the ability for people to receive care,” he added.\n\nWhat Alzheimer’s blood tests currently measure\n\nMeasuring levels of both amyloid and tau is key to understanding and diagnosing Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.\n\nThis illustration depicts cells in an Alzheimer’s affected brain. The brown areas depict beta-amyloid protein plaques. The blue areas represent tau proteins that accumulate and form tangles. NIH/AP\n\nAmyloid plaques play a key role in the development of Alzheimer’s when small clusters gather at synapses in the brain and interfere with the nerve cells’ ability to communicate. Such plaques are thought to trigger changes in tau proteins, which form into tangles in parts of the brain controlling memory.\n\nTau tangles are also implicated in other neurological diseases such as frontal lobe dementia, or FTD, and Lewy body dementia in which abnormal clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the brain’s neurons.\n\nThe biomarker plasma phosphorylated tau 217, or p-tau217 for short, is a top contender in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. Its cousin, p-tau 181, is also a helpful indicator.\n\nP-tau 217 is a “beautiful marker for Alzheimer’s,” Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Association, told CNN in an earlier interview.\n\n“You’re not really measuring amyloid, but the test is telling you it’s there, and that’s been backed up with objective PET (positron emission tomography) scans that can see amyloid in the brain,” Carrillo said. “… If you have elevated tau in your brain, however, then we know that’s a sign of another type of dementia.”\n\nAnother biomarker test is the amyloid 42/40 ratio scan, which measures two types of amyloid proteins, another key biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease. At times, such tests work best when used together. In an earlier study, a combination of both amyloid and p-tau 217 tests, called the amyloid probability score, showed a 90% accuracy rate in determining whether memory loss is due to Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nGlial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, and neurofilament light chain, or NfL, which indicate brain inflammation and degenerative decay, are also helpful in tracking the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Dozens more biomarkers are being tested in labs around the world.\n\nIsaacson’s team at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases is studying more than 125 individual markers from a variety of commercial and research-based tests, some of which may soon be available in a clinical setting.\n\nWhy investigate so many? Because personalized medicine may demand it, Niotis said.\n\n“Neurodegenerative diseases present so differently in different people,” she said. “It may be we will need a very nuanced, individualized approach in clinical practice to monitor the effectiveness of what we’re doing for a given patient.”\n\nHard work pays off in reduced risk\n\nThe ongoing preventive neurology study called BioRAND reported on 71 participants, with biomarkers being analyzed on 54 people. The other 17 people served as the control group.\n\nThe group of 54 received a series of personalized lifestyle recommendations designed to improve their brain. Such interventions have been shown in past research to improve memory and thinking skills by five points on a cognitive test for people with mild cognitive impairment.\n\nThe recommendations include a focus on blood pressure control, diet, exercise, stress reduction, sleep hygiene and weight control as well as addressing metabolic, hormonal and nutrient imbalances. Medications, vitamins and supplements are tailored to each person’s unique needs.\n\nSimilar to a 2019 study led by Isaacson and Niotis, people who fulfilled at least 60% of the lifestyle recommendations were considered high compliance, while those who implemented less than 60% were low compliance. Periodic blood tests tracked progress in various brain biomarkers.\n\nThe outcome? The more work people put into change, the better their brains. Just look at Penny Ashford.\n\n“My blood work was terrible; my eating habits were terrible. I didn’t exercise, so my muscle tone was really bad — I had no muscles in my bottom or on my thighs,” Ashford said.\n\n“I got the lecture of a lifetime,” she said. “They told me, ‘Your window is closing, your markers are so bad. Either you’ve got to do this, or you’re done.’”\n\n‘A 10 out of 10’ on diet and exercise\n\nA lifelong sugar addict, Ashford stopped eating sweets.\n\n“I used to think I had a chemical imbalance because I was such a crazy freak about sugar — I could polish off a whole bag of Oreos, no problem, and I love ice cream,” Ashford said.\n\n“I haven’t had a dessert. I haven’t had ice cream. I haven’t had anything except fruit since a year ago March.”\n\nBy working hard to improve her lifestyle, Penny Ashford has greatly improved blood biomarkers that track brain health. Ted Ashford\n\nShe began an intense exercise program of cardio and resistance training, along with yoga for stress reduction, and moved to a plant-based Mediterranean style of eating. Under a doctor’s supervision, she added supplements and vitamins to boost energy and lower stress.\n\n“She was a 10 out of 10 with her diet and exercise,” Niotis said. “She lost around 30 pounds and gained lean muscle mass. It was amazing.”\n\nA year later, Ashford’s blood biomarkers told a completely different story about her brain health. Her p-tau 217 dropped by 43% and her p-tau 181 by 75%.\n\n“We also looked at GFAP and neurofilament light, the markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration,” Niotis said. “Penny’s GFAP went down by 66% and her NfL went down by 84%.\n\n“These are really impressive changes in these markers of neuronal health,” she said. “And the best part about it is it really did track with her clinical symptoms. Her word retrieval problems improved, and she felt so much better.”\n\n‘I’m so proud of myself’\n\nAshford wasn’t the only top performer in the study. Blood biomarkers also significantly improved across the entire group given risk reduction advice, Isaacson said, even those who were not as committed as Ashford.\n\n“I’ve lost count on how many people have shown blood markers of brain disease trend in the right direction, but every time it amazes me,” he said. “For over 20 years, I was told that what is happening right in front of my eyes was impossible, but the patients’ stories, clinical improvements and test results speak for themselves.”\n\nMuch more work remains before blood testing for Alzheimer’s becomes a routine part of clinical practice, Isaacson said.\n\n“Our group has a saying, ‘Promise not to overpromise.’ By this we mean it’s critical to be transparent about the current limitations of these tests, and the variability across different platforms,” he said.\n\nWhile science works out the kinks, Ashford counts herself lucky to be able to track changes in her biomarker numbers — a key motivator in her journey toward better brain health.\n\n“It’s huge, huge,” she said. “I’m so proud of myself. And each success that I have empowers me to do more, keep going and not let up.\n\n“I look back at my dad. He didn’t have any of these options. I watched my dad deteriorate, and I thank God, I am so lucky. We are so lucky.”",

    "title": "This American golfer won $1.5 million in a tournament. Here’s why he couldn’t cash the check",
    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "CNN —\n\nLife comes at you fast when you’re a prodigiously talented young golfer, so fast in fact that an awful lot of money might just slip through your fingers.\n\nAt the start of last year, Nick Dunlap was studying finance at the University of Alabama and he set himself up for a payday that no student could ever imagine: $1,512,000. Dunlap earned the money, but unfortunately, he never got to cash the check.\n\n“It stings a little bit,” Dunlap explained to CNN Sports, reflecting on his incredible performance at the PGA Tour’s American Express tournament in California, where he’d been invited to play on a sponsor’s exemption.\n\nFew could have imagined what would happen next, as Dunlap became the tour’s second youngest champion in 90 years and its first amateur champion since Phil Mickelson in 1991. It was a remarkable achievement, but it came with an extraordinary catch: as an amateur player, Dunlap had to forfeit the cash prize.\n\n“At the time, I don’t think I really knew what $1.5 million was,” he smiled. “It wasn’t as hard as it is now. But ultimately, I got what I wanted in the end: a trophy.”\n\nDunlap’s rapid success shouldn’t have been a complete surprise to anybody who’d been tracing his trajectory in the amateur game. Just months earlier, he’d joined Tiger Woods as the only other man to win both the US Junior Amateur and the US Amateur titles.\n\nA few months later, Dunlap achieved something that even Woods never did, he won again on the PGA Tour, but this time it was for money; nobody had ever won as both an amateur and a professional in the same season.\n\nWhile golf is a genteel sport, Dunlap describes himself almost like an adrenaline junkie. “I just love competing,” he explained. “I miss it when I’m at home. I miss being in the hunt and having that feeling of being nervous. My parents are both highly competitive as well, so I think I have them to blame for that!”\n\nDunlap never graduated from Alabama: he quickly packed up his schoolbooks and joined the PGA Tour in the days after his California win. Initially, he struggled on the course, recording just one top-10 finish in six months and missing the cut in the three majors that he played.\n\nBut at the end of his first season as a professional on the course, he’d put a tidy $3 million in the bank. If he struggled to adjust to his new life in any way, he thinks, it was off the course.\n\n“It was just learning how to be a man, a grown-up,” he reflected to CNN. “In college, everything is laid out for you.\n\n“Obviously, the step I took was very large and I skipped multiple levels, and I knew there were going to be some speed bumps along the way. I got a place in South Florida, figuring out all that stuff, figuring out taxes and accountants and how to open bank accounts, that was the biggest change for me.”\n\nSome of the more established players on the tour have teased Dunlap about his youthfulness and, in some ways, he’s in no hurry to grow up. “I’m my own worst critic, being out here is very stressful,” he mused. “I still try to be (a kid).”\n\nDunlap is looking to make his first cut at a major at the 2025 Masters. Andy Lyons/Getty Images\n\nDespite now being ranked as one of the top 50 golfers on the planet, he says it helps if he doesn’t always take the game so seriously: “I played with a buddy of mine at a Pop Stroke Putt Putt championship. I still try to have fun with it too.”\n\nThere is no question that Nick Dunlap is highly motivated, but he says that he tends to keep his goals and his dreams to himself. It’s no surprise, however, that he’d want to succeed in the major tournaments, where he’s still looking to make his first weekend appearance in five attempts and his Masters debut last year was as memorable as it was forgettable!\n\n“It’s the only place I’ve ever been nervous playing a practice round,” he recalled, “there’s just a different feeling about it. Ever since I picked up a golf club, you look forward to that.”\n\nPlaying alongside then defending champion Jon Rahm and the former US open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, Dunlap drove his opening tee shot way to the left of the fairway and into a crowd of patrons.\n\n“I expected myself to be pretty nervous,” he chuckled. “It didn’t help that I hooked it off the first tee and literally cracked some dude’s head open. Like, he’s bleeding everywhere. I’m like, ‘Yeah, that’s a good start,’” he added wryly. The next day, Dunlap was cut from the tournament too.\n\nAfter such an inauspicious start at Augusta, things will surely only improve for Nick Dunlap and he knows that, whatever happens on tour, he wouldn’t trade it for anything.\n\n“This is what I always wanted to do,” he said. “To play golf and get paid for it, even better. Traveling the world, seeing some of the greatest golf courses in the history of the game and playing against the best players in the world. I think it’s definitely a dream!”",

    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "New York CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump warned Americans in 2024 that a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris would be a vote for a market meltdown.\n\n“You want to see a market crash? If we lost this election, I think the market would go down the tubes,” Trump said at a Pennsylvania rally in late October.\n\nWeeks earlier, Trump confidently predicted that if he lost, “the result will be a Kamala economic crash, a 1929-style depression.”\n\nTrump won the election, but he may have been right about a crash occurring after the election.\n\nTrump and his tariffs have taken a bull stock market and are on the precipice of turning it into a bear faster than any president has overseen in modern history. If the stock market closes in bear territory – a drop of 20% from a recent peak – it would be the earliest in a new administration a bull market has turned into a bear in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.\n\nThese same tariffs may also take a booming economy and turn it into a recession.\n\nThe S&P 500 had lost 15% of its value since Inauguration Day as of Sunday night. And that doesn’t even count the massive losses set for Monday’s opening bell.\n\nThe only similar drop for an elected president so quickly into his presidency was under George W. Bush in 2001.\n\nThe next largest drop after Bush and Trump was Carter in early 1977. That decline was under 6%, to give you an idea of just how far the rabbit hole the market is right now.\n\nThe current market wipeout hit a crescendo after Trump’s “Liberation Day” event, where he shocked and alarmed the business world by promising to increase tariffs at an unprecedented pace. Indeed, two-thirds of the 15% fall in the S&P 500 has been since Liberation Day.\n\n“Liberation Day has been followed by Annihilation Days in the stock market,” Ed Yardeni, of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday.\n\nThe awfulness of the past two days of trading were matched only by the 1987 crash, the 2008 financial crisis and the Covid crash of 2020.\n\nOf course, the recent market’s plunge alone isn’t all that’s unique about the current situation. What was happening before the plunge makes it particularly special.\n\nBush took office with a market that was already in decline. As you read this article, it might be hard for some of you to remember or imagine that there was a stock market crash related to the internet.\n\nThe bursting of the dot-com bubble plunged the caused the S&P 500 by to drop 10% in 2000. It would, therefore, be tough to say that Bush was responsible for the poor state of the market in April 2001.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, inherited a bull market. The S&P 500 gained 23% in 2024.\n\nIndeed, it is quite easy to say that Trump is directly responsible for the dive under his presidency given how much of it occurred since Liberation Day.\n\nWe should note that the 15% drop under Trump in the S&P 500 does not qualify as a bear market yet. A bear market by most definitions requires a drop of 20% from a recent peak. The Nasdaq already crossed that threshold, however, closing in a bear market on Friday for the first time since 2022. The Russell 2000 is in a bear market, too.\n\nAn economy in decline\n\nOf course, there is the matter of whether what happens on Wall Street affects or is at least representative of the larger economy.\n\nThe answer to the first part of that sentence is probably “yes,” while the answer to the second part could very well be “yes,” too.\n\nAlthough some Trump officials have argued they are trying to help Main Street, even if it hurts Wall Street, it’s not easy to separate the two.\n\nThis isn’t the early 1970s anymore when polling indicated that less than 25% of Americans were involved in the stock market. Those were the days before IRAs and 401(k)s. As of 2024, more than three-in-five Americans were involved in the market in some way per Gallup.\n\n“Wall Street is Main Street,” Yardeni said. “The two streets prosper and suffer together…Main Street owns lots of stocks in American corporations that are facing massive disruptions as a result of Trump Tariffs 2.0.”\n\nMoreover, David Kotok, co-founder of Cumberland Advisors, warned the Trump tariffs will act as a massive supply shock akin to the 1973-1974 oil price shock during the Yom Kippur War.\n\n“The Trump tariffs are a massive tax hike imposed as a sales tax on American consumers,” Kotok said. “Supply shocks mean higher inflation coupled with slow growth or recession, which is the worst of all worlds for the central bank.”\n\nWhile there isn’t one universally agreed upon definition of a recession, take a look at these odds: JPMorgan has raised the chance of a recession to 60%. It had previously been 40%. Goldman Sachs has raised it from 20% to 45%. HSBC puts it at 40%.\n\nWe’ll see if the National Bureau of Economic Research calls a recession before the end of the year. They rely upon a host of metrics to make that determination.\n\nAnother definition of a recession is if we have two consecutive quarters of decline in the real gross domestic product. We’ve already seen forecasts for real GDP plummet. Some forecasts have it falling below zero for quarter 1 of this year, and others have it barely staying positive.\n\nThe last time real GDP had two consecutive negative quarters in the first year of an elected presidency after not having a recession the year before? 1953, as the United States was coming out of the Korean War.\n\nThe only war Trump can point to if a recession does occur is the trade war he started.\n\nAnd to be clear all of this could become a nasty cycle. If the market becomes convinced a recession is on the way, stocks could fall further. RBC Capital Markets notes that the median loss for the S&P 500 during a recession is 27%.\n\nConfidence is a fragile thing and the steep market selloff could easily spook CEOs and consumers alike. The hole blown in Americans’ 401(k) plans and investment portfolios is so massive that it will be hard to ignore. And if consumers stop spending, all bets are off in this economy.",

    "title": "Bessent’s Mar-a-Lago tariff message to Trump: zero in on the endgame",
    "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
    "content": "CNN —\n\nAs President Donald Trump’s new tariffs shook global markets and sent foreign leaders scrambling this weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent flew to Mar-a-Lago with a message.\n\nIt was imperative to get the administration’s tariff communications aligned, Bessent told Trump, and more focused on the endgame for Americans: better trade deals with foreign nations, according to people familiar with the conversation.\n\nThe risk in not doing so would be further market turmoil, Bessent conveyed.\n\nThe meeting was an example of the conflicting narratives swirling around Trump — with some corners pushing an effort to make deals and calm the markets. But five days after his splashy Rose Garden tariff announcement, foreign leaders and US investors alike are all still looking for clues of how willing the president is to negotiate down the duties. And as those outside observers pore over interviews and remarks from Trump’s constellation of economic advisers, it has not been clear what it will take to end the global trade war.\n\nDelegations from US trading partners large and small were preparing to seek out American officials or plan trips to Washington to try and ascertain exactly how to remove the new duties. Offers were already coming in from some of the world’s largest trading blocs. The European Union, for example, offered to drop tariffs to zero on automobiles and industrial goods.\n\nIn all, 70 countries had approached the US administration to discuss trade issues in the wake of the new tariffs, administration officials said late Monday.\n\nWhether any of that outreach works remained an open question, with significant ramifications both for the global economy and American consumers. Mixed signals from Trump and members of his economic team on Monday offered little clarity on how and when relief might appear.\n\nOne fact that did seem clear was Trump’s willingness to weather whatever political or financial fallout occurs in the near term as the new tariffs take effect later this week. Instead of endorsing an off-ramp, he said he was willing to further ratchet up tariffs on China if that country’s retaliatory tariffs remain in place.\n\nBessent has been one of the most visible proponents of Trump’s tariffs, and has ensured there is little daylight between himself and the president on the plan to apply the new duties. At the same time, he has also voiced the view that countries can and should seek out the administration for new trade agreements — a position the president himself took Monday after his meeting with his Treasury secretary in Florida, which was first reported by Politico.\n\nAfter a morning telephone call between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Bessent announced that Trump had tasked him and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer with opening new negotiations with Japan meant to “implement the President’s vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade.”\n\nYet at the same time, both Trump and his aides suggested those talks are not expected to yield results immediately.\n\nOther advisers continued to insist the conversations over tariffs were not “negotiations” at all, but rather a more permanent way to realign global trade.\n\nIn describing Trump’s approach, advisers said he was hoping to milk the United States’ trading partners for everything he can get, and that doing so will likely take time. Because every country is different, those negotiations will be tailored to Trump’s direct conversations with them, those advisers said.\n\n“Everyone is desperate. If you have a desperate partner you can get a lot more, in the long run,” one White House official told CNN, adding that dozens of countries are coming to the table with options for how to best move forward and that Trump “will choose the best deal he can make to ensure we’re getting fair rates and bringing down the deficits.”\n\nThe official added that for now, the White House expects other countries to bring them their best offers — and only then will Trump be willing to deal.\n\nA second Trump administration official told CNN that one of the highest priorities for the president is to work out deals that will erase America’s trade deficit with other countries.\n\nStill, some officials behind the scenes believe that Trump should work out some deals sooner rather than later to put wins on the board to show the American people his tariff plan is working, and to further restore confidence in their overall message encouraging Americans to be patient, people familiar with the talks said.\n\n“You need to instill hope in people who are watching their 401ks dwindle and the stock market crash. They need to do something to convince them to hold on a little longer and buy them the time they need to work this out,” a person close to Trump told CNN.\n\nSome of Trump’s wealthy supporters, such as billionaire investor Bill Ackman, publicly denounced the president’s actions on tariffs, but others remained silent Monday as the turmoil continued on Wall Street.\n\nIn interviews, some advisers to billionaire donors urged patience to see how Trump’s moves would play out, noting they could result in negotiations that would significantly lower the tariff rates imposed by other countries. Some indicated they were more focused on their own priorities in Washington and not inclined to risk those goals by public feuding with the administration.\n\nDivergent positions from the administration\n\nBut in the span of Monday afternoon, the administration offered divergent positions from different corners of the president’s team.\n\nJust as Bessent posted on social media about leading negotiations with Japan, trade adviser Peter Navarro published a new opinion article in the Financial Times, staking out a firm line against easing off the tariffs and declaring, once again, “This is not a negotiation.”\n\nSpeaking at a Washington think tank, another of Trump’s top economic advisers acknowledged there were a variety of viewpoints.\n\n“There are conflicting narratives because everyone’s got an opinion,” said Stephen Miran, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, during a speech at the Hudson Institute. “That’s fine. Disagreement is how you can avoid group think.”\n\nStill, the “conflicting narratives” emanating from the White House have also generated confusion on Wall Street and in foreign capitals. An erroneous report on social media Monday morning suggesting Trump was open to a 90-day pause on the new tariffs sent markets sharply higher, only to drop again after the White House denied it as “fake news.”\n\nLater in the Oval Office, Trump affirmed he wasn’t looking at a pause in the new tariffs. And he suggested deals to remove the new duties wouldn’t happen quickly.\n\n“We’re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don’t, we’re going to have nothing to do with them,” Trump said. “They’re not going to be allowed to participate in the United States.”\n\nHe went on to deny any disconnect in the messages his team has been conveying, on either the permanence of the tariffs or whether he was open to negotiations in bringing them down.\n\n“They can both be true. There can be permanent tariffs and they can also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,” he said alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who left Washington without any guarantee from Trump that the 17% tariff he announced on Israel last week would be lifted.\n\nCNN’s Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report.",

    "title": "AG Pam Bondi moves the goalposts on the nation’s ‘constitutional crisis’",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "As Donald Trump’s second term got underway, and his administration expressed indifference to legal limits, even going so far as to suggest the White House might disregard court rulings, there’s been ample discussion about whether the United States is facing a constitutional crisis. As it turns out, the president and his team are eager to join this public conversation, though they have some unusual thoughts on the matter.\n\nIn mid-February, for example, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that “the real constitutional crisis is taking place within our judicial branch,” because several judges had issued rulings the president did not like. While different political scientists define “constitutional crisis” in different ways, Leavitt’s assessment was, by any fair measure, ridiculous.\n\nBut another one of Trump’s prominent spokespersons, who ostensibly leads the Justice Department, took this absurdity one step further over the weekend. Politico reported:\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi on Sunday pushed back on the idea that President Donald Trump might ignore future rulings decided by the Supreme Court, spurring constitutional discord. The real crisis, she argued, is the barrage of lawsuits the White House faces as it tries to move quickly on its agenda.\n\n“Just since January 20th, we’ve had over 170 lawsuits filed against us. That should be the constitutional crisis right there, 50 injunctions,” Bondi said on “Fox News Sunday.” (For those keeping score, this was the attorney general’s 13th appearance on Fox since being sworn in nine weeks ago. She’s still averaging roughly one Fox appearance every four days.)\n\nTo be sure, the Republican lawyer makes weird political arguments all the time, but this was more outrageous than most. The White House’s Leavitt argued that it’s a “constitutional crisis” for judges to issue opinions that Trump disagrees with, but the nation’s chief law enforcement official’s claim was just as outlandish, if not more so: Bondi argued that for Americans to take their legal concerns to the courts is itself a “constitutional crisis.”\n\nIt reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how the American system works. In this country, if you believe the government is abusing its legal authority, you have the right to file a lawsuit and bring your concerns to a judge, who is expected to adjudicate the matter fairly and rule on the legal merits.\n\nTo hear the attorney general tell it, however, if Americans exercise their legal rights by filing such lawsuits, they’re necessarily creating a “crisis.”\n\nAs for how the administration might deal with such a crisis, Bondi didn’t say.\n\nDuring the same on-air appearance, the Fox host asked whether there might be a future scenario in which Trump defies a court order. The attorney general replied, “The president is going to comply with the law. He was overwhelmingly elected by an overwhelming majority of the United States citizens to be our commander-in-chief.”\n\nFirst, she could’ve said, “Of course the president will comply with court orders,” but Bondi instead answered a question that wasn’t asked. Second, suggesting that Trump will comply with the White House’s interpretation of the law was hardly reassuring. Third, Trump won with less than 50% of the popular vote, which isn’t even close to being “an overwhelming majority.”\n\nBut stepping back, it’s also worth appreciating the degree to which the line between the attorney general and the White House press office has grown awfully blurry of late. Those who at least pretended to be concerned about the politicization of federal law enforcement in recent years should probably take note.",

    "title": "The 3 words that Putin apologists use to blame the West for Russian aggression",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "This is the first in a five-part MSNBC Daily series, \"The Future of NATO.\" With the Trump administration attacking allies, removing troops from European training missions, handing Ukraine’s bargaining chips to Russia and refusing to guarantee European security even as “backstop” — we’re asking five crucial questions about the future of NATO, the U.S. and Europe.\n\nAt a time when NATO faces perhaps its greatest challenge, the question of its so-called “expansion” at the end of the Cold War remains very much alive. The two matters are, in fact, closely entwined. NATO’s enemies — both in Russia and now, sadly, in and around the White House — continue to deploy spurious arguments to weaken the alliance and justify Vladimir Putin’s brazen war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe flawed argument about NATO expansion flows from two false premises. One is that in February 1990, when then-U.S. Secretary of State James Baker uttered the words “not one inch eastward,” he allegedly “promised” Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that the American-led defense alliance would not enlarge.\n\nThe flawed argument about NATO expansion flows from two false premises.\n\nMany of those who have latched on to this phrase are oblivious to the context. Baker and Gorbachev were discussing German reunification, not central and Eastern European security. At the time, Baker made no hard and fast promises, for these were exploratory talks to test ideas, and both sides vowed to speak more in the future. Nor, as secretary of state, was Baker in a position to promise anything. The president needed to sign off on any pledge.\n\nCrucially, President George H.W. Bush never used the “not one inch” phrase. Instead, he spoke about the “special status” of East German territory, which would have to be negotiated (for this was seven months before the details were enshrined in the “Two Plus Four” treaty settling the German question).\n\nWhile the diplomatic reality of 1990 was complicated, the unscrupulous political use of these discussions has been quite simple. Putin has repeatedly deployed the false notion of the West’s “broken promises” in his propaganda campaign as he seeks to reclaim the Soviet sphere of influence lost at the end of the Cold War. For him, the “not one inch” phrase is a useful tool as he seeks to push NATO back to its 1997 borders while justifying his military actions and own revanchism and revisionism.\n\nUnfortunately, Putin has also found useful idiots in the West, willing to aid and abet his nefarious campaign.\n\nThe second flawed premise about the 1990s is based on the belief that America was in some way the aggressor — that Washington used NATO to expand America’s own influence while looking to humiliate and directly threaten the Russian Federation in the process.\n\nWhat this argument totally ignores is the agency of European states. After 1991, those in central and Eastern Europe especially benefited from NATO’s “open door” policy, effectively in existence since 1949, for it is based on Article 10 of the founding treaty.\n\nUnfortunately, Putin has also found useful idiots in the West, willing to aid and abet his nefarious campaign.\n\nWhat’s more, according to the principles of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, as sovereign states these European countries also have the right to freely choose whether to join any alliance — a right that Moscow acknowledged when it signed the act. The ex-Soviet satellite states and the Baltic states utilized these opportunities, in large part, because they had never wanted to be part of Stalin’s “empire by imposition” symbolized by the Warsaw Pact. They also feared that as soon as Russia recovered from its economic collapse and postcolonial trauma, it would expand again.\n\nThese concerns were met by significant skepticism. In the 1990s, Washington (and other capitals) were still gripped by hopes for a “commonwealth of nations” and a “better” post-Berlin Wall world.\n\nYet ultimately, Russia’s democracy was stillborn. Already under President Boris Yeltsin, ultranationalism, authoritarianism and talk of the “near abroad” and “russkii mir” raised the specter of Russian neo-imperialism. After Putin arrived at the Kremlin, Russian ambitions — and Eastern European fears — eventually came true.\n\nWhen Putin sent his troops into Ukraine in 2022, his goal was to wipe the country from the map. In response, Finland and Sweden quickly applied to join the NATO club, abandoning their traditional commitment to neutrality or military nonalignment in the process. By 2024, they too had entered the alliance through its open door.\n\nIn short, then, NATO “expansion” has been driven not so much by Washington’s imperial impulse. Rather, it has been a reaction to a shared European perception that Moscow remains a clear and present danger to its security.\n\nThis remains the situation today. Despite headlines that fluctuate by the hour, two fundamental developments are clear.\n\nWhen Putin sent his troops into Ukraine in 2022, his goal was to wipe the country from the map.\n\nOn the one hand, Putin does not tolerate the concept of “sovereign equality” of states. It is one of the fundamental principles of the liberal international order that he has declared obsolete. Putin (like China’s President Xi Jinping and, apparently, America’s President Donald Trump) believes in only strong states — Russia, China, the U.S. — being “truly sovereign.” Small states have no status. That is a main reason why he is so keen to talk bilaterally with Trump, ignoring Ukraine (and America’s European allies). Putin’s maxim is clear. Those not at the table are on the menu — and can potentially be eaten alive.\n\nOn the other, the erratic Trump has eroded — and perhaps even already destroyed — Europe’s faith in America’s reliability. Nor does America seem prepared to pursue a Rooseveltian view of Western security. In this view, which has largely held sway in Washington since the 1940s, cooperation and interdependence with Europe are in the U.S. national interest. The trans-Atlantic alliance is more than just an operative defense club under the American nuclear umbrella, but an organization based on genuine friendship. And both America and Europe share a common belief in order, stability, the rule of law and democracy.\n\nAll these key pillars of the cohesive postwar West were intended to secure long-term peace and prosperity. With their rapid crumbling, France’s Emmanuel Macron, the U.K.’s Keir Starmer and Germany’s Friedrich Merz — together with the rest of Europe — are not only heavily investing in their own defense and deterrence capabilities. They are also insisting on the vital relevance of this rules-based order.\n\nIndeed, Europe is fortunately rising to the challenge. Its leaders would prefer America to be an active and reliable partner. The invitation these countries extended in the late 1940s for Washington to lead a consensual empire still exists. Yet the leaders of these countries remain doubtful about America’s desire to stay at the party. While hoping for the best, they are therefore preparing for the worst. Which is a world where a distant, volatile and bullying America is no longer dependable, while a looming, brutalized and calculating Russia poses an ever-greater threat, not only symbolized by its direct military aggression in Ukraine, but also through its conduct of nonlinear and distinctly political warfare.\n\nRussian hybrid warfare is already an established fact. And the Kremlin’s continuous and erroneous claims of NATO’s wrongful expansion is merely one key prong in this political conflict. Besides the destruction of Ukraine, what Putin wants is to drive the Euro-Atlantic community apart — and to see it wrecked. Europeans are determined not to let this happen. What America really wants remains to be seen.",

    "content": "On Wednesday afternoon, shortly after stock market trading had wrapped up for the day, Donald Trump kicked off a trade war with sweeping international trade tariffs. On Thursday, Wall Street followed international markets off a cliff.\n\nIt was at that point that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, in apparent seriousness, that the two developments might’ve been unrelated.\n\n“For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told far-right media personality Tucker Carlson, in an interview that was released on Friday.\n\nTwo days later, as NBC News reported, the Cabinet secretary kept talking, though he hardly made matters any better.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” Bessent called it a “false narrative” that people who are close to retiring may be reluctant after their retirement savings may have dropped last week because of the stock market downturn. “I think that’s a false narrative,” he told moderator Kristen Welker. “Americans who want to retire right now, the Americans who put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don’t look at the day-to-day fluctuations.”\n\nPerhaps Bessent should have conversations with a wider range of people — because there were countless Americans looking at the “day-to-day fluctuations” in their retirement accounts last week.\n\nIn the same interview, the treasury secretary — ostensibly one of the most powerful and influential figures on the planet when it comes to the economy and financial markets — told host Kristen Welker, “[W]hat I’ve been very impressed with is the market infrastructure, that we had record volume on Friday and everything is working very smoothly. So, the American people, they can be very, take great comfort in that.”\n\nWhy would Americans take “great comfort” in the fact that trillions of dollars of wealth disappeared “very smoothly”? I’m not sure, though Bessent delivered the line as if he believed it made sense. It did not.\n\nStepping back, it’s worth emphasizing that Bessent was hardly seen as a controversial Cabinet choice for Trump. On the contrary, he was seen as one of the president’s most mainstream personnel choices for his second term, and the Treasury secretary was confirmed with more Democratic votes than most of his fellow secretaries.\n\nUpon his confirmation, many hoped that Bessent would be a voice of reason in the Trump administration. On a team filled with cranks and charlatans, Bessent might be in a position to steer the president in responsible directions, serving as the proverbial “adult in the room.”\n\nBut those hopes have been dashed. As The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell recently summarized in a column focused on the treasury secretary, “The ‘adults in the room’ sometimes failed in Trump’s first term. Now, they’re not even pretending to try.”\n\nMSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle told viewers, “My sources say that Scott Bessent is kind of the odd man out here and, in the inner circle that Trump has, he’s not even close to Scott Bessent or listening to him. Some have said to me, he’s looking for an exit door to try to get himself to the Fed, because in the last few days he’s really hurting his own credibility and history in the markets.”\n\nOf course, if Bessent is worried about salvaging his credibility, he might already be too late.",

    "title": "With protests and action, Democrats just had their best week since Election Day",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the April 6 episode of “Inside with Jen Psaki.”\n\nLast week, Donald Trump showed us, once again, just how much damage his administration and its misguided policies could inflict on the American people. But there’s also a hopeful lesson we can take from the last few days: People are fighting back. I’d even venture to say that last week was the best political week Democrats, and anyone else horrified by the Trump administration, have had since Election Day.\n\nAcross the country, it’s the people who are driving this huge energy shift. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of Americans poured into the streets in communities big and small to protest against Trump. While cities like New York and Washington, D.C., saw tens of thousands, and big crowds showed up in red areas, too.\n\nI’m not saying this is enough or that it will stop all the damage. Republicans still run both the Senate and the House, after all. But these are all steps in the right direction.\n\nThe American people are also making themselves heard at the ballot box. On Tuesday, the people of Wisconsin delivered a complete rebuke to Elon Musk as he attempted to buy a state Supreme Court seat. The world’s richest man went so far as to travel there to campaign with oversized checks and cheesehead hats. Voters responded by electing a liberal judge by a double-digit margin over the MAGA favorite. In Florida, the outpouring of anti-Trump and anti-Musk energy shaved roughly 15 to 20 points off Republicans’ November margins in two special elections for Congress. These are all good signs.\n\nPeople are also responding by throwing their hat in the ring to run for higher office. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra launched a bid for California governor; Garlin Gilchrist, Michigan’s lieutenant governor, entered the gubernatorial race; and Mallory McMorrow, a Michigan state senator, jumped into a race for an open U.S. Senate seat.\n\nDemocrats in Washington are also showing some signs of life. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes, breaking the record of segregationist Strom Thurmond and reminding Americans that someone is standing up for them.\n\nClearly a lot of people were hungry for somebody in Washington to take that kind of action. On Booker’s TikTok account alone, the livestream of his speech got over 350 million likes and 110,000 people watched the senator finish his remarks on his YouTube page. In the end, Booker’s speech sparked more attention and coverage than anything else Democrats in Washington have tried since Trump took office.\n\nOther Senate Democrats joined the fight, too. Sen. Adam Schiff of California placed a hold on the nomination of Ed Martin to be the top prosecutor in Washington, D.C. Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona pledged to do the same to block Trump’s nominees for top leaders at the Department of Veterans Affairs, in protest of the president’s plans to slash jobs and jeopardize benefits at the agency. Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington spearheaded a bipartisan push to have Congress take away Trump’s power to implement tariffs. And Senate Democrats convinced a handful of Republicans to join them in voting to suspend tariffs on Canada.\n\nI’m not saying this is enough or that it will stop all the damage. Republicans still run both the Senate and the House, after all. But these are all steps in the right direction.\n\nLast week showed that the Democratic Party still has a lot of life in it.\n\nAlso last week, some of the biggest names in Democratic politics stepped back into the fray. Former President Barack Obama spoke to a crowd at Hamilton College in upstate New York on Thursday, calling out just how outrageous the last few months have been. “Imagine if I had done any of this,” Obama told the crowd. “It’s unimaginable that the same parties that are silent now would have tolerated behavior like that from me, or a whole bunch of my predecessors.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris made a rare public appearance, also calling out organizations that aren’t meeting the moment: “There is a sense of fear that is taking hold in our country, and I understand it, but we’re seeing people stay quiet. We are seeing organizations stay quiet. We are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats.”\n\nLast week showed that the Democratic Party still has a lot of life in it. So, while there are plenty of reasons to fear the actions of the Trump administration, it’s important to note that people are standing up to it. People are making their elected officials listen. There is a lot of work ahead, but these are all steps in the right direction.\n\nAs Booker wrote on social media after his marathon speech, “After getting some rest, I am in awe of everyone who continues to lift their voice and speak out. This is a moment for our country, and we must make a choice about the America we want to be.”",

    "title": "5 good signs for Democrats: Cory Booker, Wisconsin, Hand's Off",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Time to get off the mat\n\nDemocrats are starting to shake off the fog of the 2024 election. Collectively, tens of thousands of people have attended recent rallies, and many others have crowded town hall meetings to express their frustration with current lawmakers.\n\nBut this week may have offered the best signs yet. Here are five reasons it felt like a turning point for Democrats.\n\n1. Booker’s history-making speech\n\nSen. Cory Booker’s 25-hour Senate floor speech didn’t just break Sen. Strom Thurmond’s decades-old record — it was a rallying cry for Democrats desperate for someone to stand up and fight. And people paid attention: Booker’s TikTok livestream received over 350 million likes and his office fielded over 28,000 calls.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Booker sent a clear message to his colleagues: Democrats can’t afford to coast. If officials want to hold on to their seats, they need to think creatively and do everything in their power to fight Trump’s agenda — or step aside for someone who will.\n\n2. Wisconsin and Florida voters sent a message\n\nWith Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court win and improvements in Florida’s special House elections, Democrats sent Trump a warning he can’t ignore.\n\nProgressive Judge Susan Crawford won her Supreme Court seat by double digits, despite Elon Musk pouring millions into the race. This suggests his money might be helping Democrats more than it’s helping Republicans.\n\nThe fallout from Wisconsin also suggests Trump is realizing Musk is a liability. It’s no coincidence that a few days after Crawford’s win, Trump told reporters that Musk would likely be wrapping up his current role in “a few months.”\n\n3. Young candidates across the country are stepping up\n\nIf 2024 was a gut punch for progressives, 2025 is looking like a generational wake-up call. And young Democrats are answering.\n\nFrom Kat Abughazaleh in Illinois to Deja Foxx in Arizona and Christian Menefee in Texas, a wave of smart, unflinching young candidates are stepping up.\n\nMeanwhile Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow — who became a viral sensation for her floor speech condemning a colleague who accused her of “grooming children” for promoting LGBTQ values — and New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas have both announced bids for Senate seats.\n\nThese are candidates who know voters are hungry for fighters, and if elected, would redefine which voices are front and center for Democrats.\n\n4. Democratic senators are flexing their power\n\nFreshman Sens. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Adam Schiff of California are showing what it looks like when Democrats fight fire with fire. Gallego is blocking Trump’s Veterans Affairs nominees in protest of sweeping job cuts at the VA — a bold move in a bipartisan committee. Schiff is putting a hold on Ed Martin’s nomination for U.S. attorney in D.C., citing Martin’s weaponization of the office.\n\nThis is what it looks like when Democrats stop playing nice and start playing to win.\n\n5. Today’s April 5 protests could be massive\n\nThe grassroots energy hasn’t faded. If anything, it’s growing.\n\nThe nationwide Hands Off! protests on April 5 are shaping up to be the largest single-day protest since Trump took office. Organizers have planned over 1,100 events across all 50 states — and more than 250,000 people have already RSVP’d.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nNo, Democrats don’t have the White House. But they have something else right now: momentum. And a party that is waking up to the reality that business as usual is no longer acceptable.\n\nA race to watch: Texas’ 18th Congressional District\n\nIt’s been nearly a month since Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner, who represented Texas’ 18th Congressional District, passed away. But instead of calling a special election — something Gov. Greg Abbott has done swiftly in the past — he’s stalling. Why? Because he knows sending just one more Democrat to the House of Representatives could erode House Speaker Mike Johnson’s thin GOP majority. And Abbott apparently has no qualms leaving 800,000 Texans without representation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries isn’t buying Abbott’s excuses, calling the delay a deliberate power play and warning that the governor should “lawyer up.” Christian Menefee, the chief civil lawyer for Harris County and a candidate for the seat, is also ready to take Abbott to court. His message: “Your silence is suppression.”\n\nAbbott could call an emergency election tomorrow, just like he did in 2018 and 2022 when vacancies benefited Republicans. But if he waits until November — or even later — Houston’s historically Black and Hispanic 18th District will be left voiceless for months.",

    "title": "Ovechkin is the hockey GOAT after breaking NHL goals record fair and square",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "It’s a debate as old as organized athletic competition itself. Who is the greatest of all time? Alex Ovechkin is now making his own GOAT case in professional hockey. With his 895th career goal on Sunday, the Washington Capitals star has accomplished what was once unthinkable and surpassed “The Great One,” Wayne Gretzky, as the all-time leading goal scorer in NHL history.\n\nWhen Gretzky hung up his skates after his 1998-99 season with the New York Rangers, nobody could have imagined his record being broken. Now, after watching Ovechkin’s historic season, I can’t help but wonder if this will be the last “unattainable” record to fall in my lifetime.\n\nWhen Gretzky hung up his skates after his 1998-99 season with the New York Rangers, nobody could have imagined his record being broken.\n\nIn baseball, it’s Barry Bonds’ 762 career home runs. For those denouncing PEDs, it’s Hank Aaron’s 755 home runs. In basketball, it’s LeBron James’ all-time career points total (which is increasing as we speak). In football, it’s Tom Brady's 649 career passing touchdowns and 89,214 passing yards.\n\nBut I think there’s something about Ovechkin’s record that puts it in a special category as far as individual records are considered.\n\nBonds’ steroid use will forever place an asterisk next to his statistics in record books. While Brady is widely considered the football GOAT, the NFL’s offensive-minded era of football has certainly helped. James is somehow still dominating games 20 years into a surefire spot on the Mount Rushmore of the game. But like Brady, I’d argue the league he plays in now is a physically softer one. If you simply breathe on a quarterback in the wrong way, you can draw a flag. Heck, the league made a rule banning lunging for a quarterback's legs while on the ground — a rule widely believed to be the result of Brady tearing his ACL in 2008.\n\nOvechkin, on the other hand, is playing in an era when goal-scoring is down compared with Gretzky’s generation. Goalies also had far smaller pads in the ’80s and ’90s than the goalies of today. Anecdotally, you can also argue the league has far more parity today than a few decades ago, with talent widely dispersed around the league. Gretzky played alongside a series of Hall of Famers for years, forcing opponents to split their focus. Ovechkin is generally the main target of defenses.\n\nNone of this is to say that Gretzky isn’t the greatest hockey player to ever lace up ice skates. His ability to distribute the puck shows in his insane career points total. And keep in mind that Gretzky still has more career assists than any other player has total points for his career. He’s more than 1,200 points clear of the second-best player. But if we’re just looking at goals scored, Ovechkin seems to have broken the record fair and square — including in the same number of games that it took Gretzky to set the benchmark.\n\nOvechkin is 39 years old. He has one year remaining on his current, and most likely final, contract in the league. That means he could realistically push his all-time total to around 950 goals. He’s already won a Stanley Cup for his championship-starved franchise. And even without another year, it’s likely his goal record may never be broken. In fact, if the Capitals win it all this year, I wouldn’t be surprised it Ovechkin retired at the end the season.\n\nFew athletes get to walk off the stage at the very pinnacle of their careers. A broken-down Peyton Manning won a Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos before retiring, David Robinson exited stage left after winning a title with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003, and Jerome Bettis ran off the field for the final time after a 2006 Super Bowl. What could be better than breaking the unbreakable record, winning a Stanley Cup and riding off into the sunset? For Ovechkin, it would be a final hat trick in a career filled with them.",

    "title": "Why Trump's tariff chart doesn't add up",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "When President Donald Trump presented his sweeping global tariffs from the Rose Garden on Wednesday, even the most basic questions were left up in the air. At the top of the list: How did the White House derive the wildly disparate rates listed on the graphic Trump so proudly displayed? As global markets roiled in the aftermath of the announcement, the White House gave an answer about its calculations that was patently ridiculous.\n\nAs global markets roiled in the aftermath of the announcement, the White House gave an answer about its calculations that was patently ridiculous.\n\nThe simple version is that the White House calculated the tariff rate for each country by putting our trade deficit with a country over the amount of goods we import from that country and dividing. Writer James Surowiecki was among the first to crack the code in a post on X. Here’s how he later explained it in an Inc. post:\n\nBy way of example, we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia, and import $28 billion in goods from them. $17.9 billion is 64 percent of $28 billion, and on Trump’s chart that became the “tariff rate” Indonesia supposedly charges us. We have a $66 billion trade deficit with South Korea, and we import $133 billion in goods from them. Sixty-six is 50.3 percent of 133, so South Korea’s “tariff rate” is listed as 50 percent. Similarly, our trade with the U.K. is close to balanced, so the U.K. was listed as having a tariff rate of just 10%.\n\nThe U.S. Office of the Trade Representative put out a document on Wednesday night trying to make the formula seem fancy by using Greek symbols but, in the process, confirmed Surowiecki’s hypothesis. (The best part is how in trying to pretend otherwise, the formula includes two variables whose values cancel each other out in the equation.) In doing so, it laid bare just how unnecessary these tariffs really are.\n\nTrump claimed in Wednesday’s announcement that the tariffs are “reciprocal” against nations that “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” American industry. There was nothing resembling reciprocity in the rates provided, including 20% levy on items imported from the European Union and 97% on items imported from Cambodia. All other countries, including the United Kingdom, are to be subject to a flat 10% import tax.\n\nTrump holds up a chart at the White House on Wednesday. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nWhile the president said that those rates equal half the duties on American exports to those countries, the math doesn’t check out. The executive order putting the new tariffs in place suggests that the difference could be explained away by the “non-tariff barriers” to trade that other countries impose on American goods. And that still didn’t fully jibe with the specific numbers plastered on Trump’s prop on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWhile politicians, especially Trump, have railed against trade deficits, there’s nothing inherently bad about them. All a trade deficit means is that one country imports more goods from another country than it exports to that other country. If the United States has a trade deficit with Costa Rica for bananas, it doesn’t mean that America is getting shorted.\n\nThis absurd formula's existence reflects a White House that started with a policy that Trump wants and worked backward to a justification for it.\n\nTrump appears to hold the nonsensical idea that there’ll be some great surge in American production based on these tariffs — when there are certain goods that will not and cannot be produced in the United States. For example, coffee and vanilla beans are going to be subject to massive price increases as importers bringing in product from Indonesia and Madagascar are forced to pay an extra 32% and 47%, respectively, for their products. (Does the president think we can grow those crops here?)\n\nI’m going to level with you, readers. I didn’t do great in my undergraduate economics classes. I understood the concepts but never applied myself, instead considering the field in general to be “political science gone wrong with math.” But even I can tell you that none of Trump’s tariffs policy makes any logical sense. There is a total disconnect between the tariffs and the problem that Trump says the tariffs will fix.\n\nAs Dean Baker, a senior economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, put it on Substack: “Suppose your doctor suddenly insisted that you needed to follow a strict diet and exercise regimen. He said he realized you had a serious problem when he divided your height by your birthday, and it came out way too high. You would probably decide that you need a new doctor.”\n\nThis absurd formula's existence reflects a White House that started with a policy that Trump wants and worked backward to a justification for it. We’ve spent months waiting to hear how the administration would administer the global tariff scheme, but the method for doing so was unclear until Wednesday’s news conference. Even more unsettling is that there’s no sign Trump plans to back off these beloved tariffs of his, no matter how much they hurt America’s economy. Math didn’t come into play when he put this tax hike into place. It’s unclear what math — a total wipeout in the midterm elections, maybe? — will force him to back off them.",

    "title": "Jefferson Griffin lost the North Carolina Supreme Court race and ought to admit it",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Judge Jefferson Griffin, a Republican who lost his November race for the North Carolina Supreme Court, has created a scene by refusing to concede the race for five months, and recently a 2001 photo has surfaced of him wearing a Confederate uniform at a fraternity party when he was a student at the University of North Carolina. Griffin insists that the photo “does not represent the person I am today.” If it’s true that he no longer supports the Lost Cause, a mythology that glorifies the Confederates that attacked the Union, then he should also give up the lost cause of election subversion.\n\nIf it’s true that he no longer supports the Lost Cause, then he should also give up the lost cause of election subversion.\n\nIncumbent Justice Allison Riggs, the Democrat in the race, won the election by 734 votes, but by challenging 65,000 ballots that were cast in November, Griffin continues to try to whittle down the electorate after the fact to tip the race in his favor. A Friday ruling by a three-judge panel on the Republican-controlled appeals court — on which Griffin, who recused himself, sits — ruled in Griffin’s favor. The panel decided 2-1 that the 65,000 voters whose eligibility Griffin challenges should have 15 business days to prove they were eligible to vote.\n\nBut the North Carolina Supreme Court intervened Monday with a stay against the appeals court ruling. We hope it's more than a temporary pause and that the Republican majority on the state's highest court agrees with the judge who dissented from Friday's appeals court ruling. That dissenting judge argued that Friday's ruling amounts to “changing the rules by which these lawful voters took part in our electoral process after the election to discard their otherwise valid votes,” and he rightly said that “an attempt to alter the outcome of only one race among many on the ballot is directly counter to law, equity, and the Constitution.”\n\nIf the appeals court ruling is allowed to stand, then some percentage of 65,000 North Carolina voters will have seen their vote erased.\n\nConfederates lost the Civil War, but as many historians of Reconstruction have noted, the South won the culture war. Consider that Griffin, then a college student, was proudly posing in Confederate grays 136 years after that side surrendered at Appomattox.\n\nWhile the particular myths of the Lost Cause have varied over the years, the motivation stays the same: Lies about the past are told to help people in power hold on to it in the present. Historic voter turnout in North Carolina in 2008 helped send Barack Obama to the White House, and since then the party that lost that race has been pushing the myth of “voter fraud.”\n\nWith the NC NAACP, a coalition of North Carolinians sued then-Gov. Pat McCrory to block the monster voter suppression law he signed in 2013. In federal court, we asked Republicans who claimed they were concerned about widespread voter fraud to produce evidence it existed. They could not then, and they cannot now. Voter fraud is the bogeyman they warn about to keep the Lost Cause alive today.\n\nI do not question Griffin’s sincerity when he says he regrets wearing a Confederate uniform nearly a quarter century ago. He may also regret the Confederate flag his fraternity used to fly at its “Old South” ball. They’re symbols of another era. But they are symbols of a story that says Black Americans having political equality hurts white people. This is the story of the Lost Cause. It’s a lie.\n\nGriffin lost. He may not like that result, but that doesn’t mean something nefarious happened.\n\nWhen all the votes legally cast in North Carolina were counted last November, Griffin lost. He may not like that result, but that doesn’t mean something nefarious happened. His ongoing challenge to North Carolinians’ choice has become its own lost cause, deeply rooted in the tradition of myths that have kept some people re-enacting the Civil War for 160 years. For a court to rule in support of this challenge is to establish a precedent as dangerous as the Plessy v. Ferguson decision that propped up Jim Crow for almost 60 years.\n\nIt’s past time to hang up (literally and figuratively) the Confederate uniform and give up the belief system that drives Lost Cause thinking. North Carolina does better when more people vote. Any politician who doesn’t acknowledge that can’t be trusted to represent the will of the voters. Any judge who doesn’t believe that cannot faithfully interpret our state or federal constitution. The moral foundations of “we the people” are at stake in this attempt at election subversion. Each of us has a responsibility to stand against the lies that have kept the Lost Cause alive this long.",

    "title": "Supreme Court splits 5-4 to grant Trump emergency relief in Alien Enemies Act deportation litigation",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "A divided Supreme Court vacated temporary restraining orders issued by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that had halted certain deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. The court split 5-4, with Republican appointees in the majority and Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett dissenting alongside the court's three Democratic appointees.\n\nThe majority framed the matter as a mere procedural disagreement, but dissenting justices cited loftier issues at play, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor highlighting potential “life or death consequences.”\n\nIn an unsigned \"per curiam\" ruling for the court, the majority said detainees must bring their challenges in habeas corpus proceedings and must do so where they are confined. “The detainees are confined in Texas, so venue is improper in the District of Columbia,” the majority said.\n\nThe majority also said detainees under the act “must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.” The majority emphasized that it wasn’t ruling on the government’s interpretation of the act itself.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union’s Lee Gelernt, who was counsel of record at the Supreme Court for the plaintiffs who brought the case, emphasized the due process aspect of the ruling. “The critical point of this ruling is that the Supreme Court said individuals must be given due process to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is an important victory,” he said.\n\nWriting a dissent joined by the two other Democratic appointees and partly by Barrett, Sotomayor called the majority’s legal conclusion “suspect.” She said the court granted the government “extraordinary relief” without mentioning “the grave harm Plaintiffs will face if they are erroneously removed to El Salvador or regard for the Government’s attempts to subvert the judicial process throughout this litigation.”\n\nThe majority chided the dissenters’ “rhetoric” and said it agrees the detainees are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal and that \"the only question is which court will resolve that challenge.\" Similarly, Justice Brett Kavanaugh (who was in the majority) added a concurring opinion to emphasize that “all nine Members of the Court agree that judicial review is available. The only question is where that judicial review should occur.”\n\nBut on the prospect of life-or-death stakes, Sotomayor wrote, “Individuals who are unable to secure counsel, or who cannot timely appeal an adverse judgment rendered by a habeas court, face the prospect of removal directly into the perilous conditions of El Salvador’s CECOT, where detainees suffer egregious human rights abuses.” She raised the concern of people being mistakenly deported and then the government not trying to get them back, which is at issue in another case pending before the justices.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson added her own dissent to lament the majority’s actions in the case, in which, as she put it, President Donald Trump “has invoked a centuries-old wartime statute to whisk people away to a notoriously brutal, foreign-run prison. For lovers of liberty, this should be quite concerning.”\n\nThe Trump administration sought high court intervention in litigation over the 1798 law, which Trump invoked to summarily deport alleged Venezuelan gang members on flights to El Salvador. The law has been invoked just three previous times in the nation’s history, all during declared wars.\n\nOn March 15, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued temporary restraining orders to halt certain deportations under the act pending further litigation. A divided federal appellate panel in Washington, D.C., declined to halt Boasberg’s orders, and the government appealed to the justices.\n\n“This case presents fundamental questions about who decides how to conduct sensitive national-security-related operations in this country — the President, through Article II, or the Judiciary, through TROs,” the administration wrote, referring to temporary restraining orders. “The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the President. The republic cannot afford a different choice,” it said in the March 28 application to Chief Justice John Roberts, who handles emergency litigation from Washington, D.C.\n\nOpposing the government’s application, the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit argued that the administration isn’t entitled to emergency relief.\n\nOpposing the government’s application, the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit argued that the administration isn’t entitled to emergency relief. They noted that the government can still remove people under other legal authorities besides the Alien Enemies Act. And they said that without Boasberg’s temporary orders in place, the plaintiffs “will suffer extraordinary and irreparable harms — being sent out of the United States to a notorious Salvadoran prison, where they will remain incommunicado, potentially for the rest of their lives, without having had any opportunity to contest their designation as gang members.”\n\nBoasberg has separately been examining whether Trump officials violated his orders. The government has questioned the Obama-appointed judge’s authority and has maintained that it technically didn’t violate his orders in any event. But the plaintiffs said officials clearly violated his orders when they didn’t even attempt to return individuals on planes, despite Boasberg’s unambiguous directive to do so and having the ability to do so. The judge is poised to rule on the matter in the coming days after a hearing last week at which he had a hard time getting answers from the government about its compliance with his orders.\n\nThe government’s citation of national security concerns comes amid the “Signalgate” scandal, in which top officials mistakenly disclosed sensitive military information, as well as the government’s admission in another case that it made an “administrative error” in removing an individual to a Salvadoran prison who wasn’t supposed to be sent there, which Sotomayor cited in her dissent.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

    "title": "Trump attacks immigrants in racist Sexual Assault Awareness Month proclamation",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Donald Trump, self-proclaimed “protector” of women, issued a proclamation Thursday acknowledging Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, in which he leveled a bigoted attack against undocumented migrants.\n\nThe announcement began:\n\nThis month, we recognize National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month by ending the unfathomable human abuse committed under open borders policies. One of the leading causes of sexual violence over the last 4 years has been the invasion of illegal aliens at our southern border. In a treasonous act of betrayal against the American people, the previous administration unleashed an army of gangs and criminal aliens from the darkest and most dangerous corners of the world — causing a dramatic increase of sexual violence in our neighborhoods and communities. These reckless policies empowered some of the most depraved people on the planet to exploit women and children in the most vicious ways imaginable.\n\nThe rest of the screed offered more of the same.\n\nLiterally the only true statement in that quoted section is that April is in fact Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. There has not been an “invasion” of immigrants through our southern border. And despite Trump’s efforts to convince the public otherwise, studies have repeatedly shown immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the U.S.\n\nIt’s perhaps not surprising that the president is less interested in bringing awareness to sexual assaults perpetrated by American citizens. Trump himself (as you likely know) was found liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in a civil trial in 2023. He famously boasted about groping women without their consent.\n\nTrump was once an associate of Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender (but he has never been implicated in any allegations). To serve as labor secretary in his first administration, Trump named Alex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney who oversaw a controversial plea deal for Epstein in a child sex abuse case. Trump also publicly sent well-wishes to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s co-defendant in his child sex trafficking case, as she fought the charges in 2020.\n\nThree of the men Trump selected for Cabinet positions this year previously faced accusations of sexual assault (two denied any wrongdoing; the third apologized to the woman via text message). Multiple Jan. 6 insurrectionists he pardoned had prior convictions for sexual assault. And some of the insurrectionists he pardoned have since been charged with sexual assault or soliciting a minor in connection with incidents alleged to have occurred before the insurrection. And, according to reporting from the Financial Times and The Times, Trump’s administration had a hand in helping accused sex trafficker Andrew Tate return to the U.S. after the administration allegedly pressured Romanian officials to loosen travel restrictions for Tate and his brother.\n\nSo Trump’s proclamation Thursday — ostensibly “to support survivors of sexual assault” — tracks with his and his administration’s overtly racist policies. At the same time, it refuses any “awareness” of his own history of sexual abuse or the sexual misconduct alleged against those in his inner circle.\n\nNo one needs Trump to proclaim anything in support of Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month — unless it’s an apology.",

    "title": "GOP senator says he was joking when he floated using violence against journalists",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "A Republican senator on Sunday said he was only joking when he suggested a day earlier that there would be less “fake news” if people were allowed to use violence against journalists.\n\nIn a video posted to X on Saturday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma recounted the story of William Taulbee, a former congressman from Kentucky who was shot and killed by Charles Kincaid, a news reporter, in 1890.\n\n“There’s a lot we can say about reporters of the stories they write, but I bet they would write a lot less false stories — as President Trump says, ‘fake news’ — if we could still handle our differences that way,” Mullin says in the nearly two-minute video.\n\nOn Feb. 28, 1890, Kincaid, a congressional reporter for The Louisville Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times, fatally shot Taulbee on the same U.S. Capitol staircase where Mullin stood in his video. The pair had a long-term feud arising from a report Kincaid published about Taulbee’s alleged extramarital affair. Kincaid was put on trial but acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.\n\nAfter The Oklahoman published a story about Mullin's video on Sunday, Mullin downplayed his remarks and insisted he was joking.\n\n“While you’re at it, don’t forget I also JOKED about bringing back caning to settle political disputes,” Mullin wrote in a post on X criticizing The Oklahoman. “Thanks for watching my videos.” Mullin also accused the outlet — the largest daily newspaper in the state — of being “out of touch” with Oklahomans.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Reporters Without Borders, Trump insulted, threatened or attacked members of the media more than 100 times from Sept. 1 to Oct. 24.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Mullin, a former MMA fighter, has made references to violence from the U.S. Capitol. In 2023, the senator almost got into a physical altercation with the president of the Teamsters union, Sean O’Brien, during a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. After sharing a series of critical social media posts O’Brien made about Mullin in the past, the congressman told the Teamsters president to “stand your butt up” so they could settle their differences in the room.\n\n“This is the time, this is the place,” Mullin said. “If you want to run your mouth, we can be two consenting adults. We can finish it here.” Mullin eventually sat down, and the hearing continued without a physical fight.\n\nMullin is a loyal supporter of President Donald Trump, who has espoused violent rhetoric about journalists. Just days before the 2024 presidential election, Trump said he wouldn’t mind if members of the press were killed. (His spokesperson later told ABC News that the president had been joking.)\n\nBut those November comments were not an isolated incident. According to an analysis by Reporters Without Borders, Trump insulted, threatened or attacked members of the media more than 100 times in the run-up to the election.\n\nSince retaking the White House, Trump has continued his attacks on the press. His administration has blocked reporters from covering news events at the White House, ousted some outlets from their working spaces inside the Pentagon, and called for investigations into public media companies.",

    "content": "Thousands of demonstrators took part in a series of nationwide “Hands Off” protests against the Trump administration Saturday, with many articulating their ire toward the 47th president’s policies using pithy slogans on handmade signs.\n\nSome signs expressed outrage over top Trump adviser Elon Musk’s efforts to gut federal agencies and slash the federal workforce.

    "title": "The 'Hands off!' protests against Trump show the left is finding its voice",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "The day after President Donald Trump was sworn into office for his first term, he was met with the largest single-day protest in American history. But the second time around, the protests surrounding Trump’s inauguration were comparably muted — they were a fraction of the size, and generated far less impact than the first round. The disparity seemed to capture the demoralized, depleted mood among Americans who opposed Trump and stared slack-jawed as he won the popular vote upon his third attempt at the White House.\n\nYet on Saturday, mass protests swept the nation, and it could mean that dissenting Americans are finding their voices again. At a time when Trump is moving aggressively to crack down on intellectual and political dissent at universities, last weekend’s protests represented a massive rebuke of the Trump administration — and suggested the left is regaining its footing, as it figures out how to fight back.\n\nRegistering dissent is an important democratic exercise.\n\nSaturday’s “Hands Off!” rallies were backed by a large coalition of organizations that included civil rights groups, labor unions, climate groups, progressive activist outfits and left-wing groups like the Democratic Socialists of America. The organizers put forth three demands: “an end to the billionaire takeover and rampant corruption of the Trump administration”; “an end to slashing federal funds for Medicaid, Social Security, and other programs working people rely on”; and “an end to the attacks on immigrants, trans people, and other communities.”\n\nThe turnout was big: Over 1,000 “Hands Off” protests were planned across all 50 states, and organizers said turnout far exceeded the turnout of 500,000 RSVPs. There aren’t any independent estimates of national turnout, but dense, large crowds made their presence known in many cities. Per The New York Times:\n\nOn Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the protest stretched for nearly 20 blocks. In Chicago, thousands flooded Daley Plaza and adjacent streets, while, in the nation’s capital, tens of thousands surrounded the Washington Monument. In Atlanta, the police estimated the crowd marching to the gold-domed statehouse at over 20,000.\n\nIn addition to the crowds of thousands — or tens of thousands — who showed up in cities and towns across the nation, protests also took place abroad in cities including London, Paris and Berlin.\n\nLike all mass protests, the messages conveyed at these ones were diverse and sprawled beyond the overarching themes of the organizers. Protest signs expressed concern about free speech at a time when Trump is trying to quash it by bullying universities and attempting to deport legal immigrants who express pro-Palestinian speech. There were objections to Trump’s global economy-destabilizing tariff regime. In Washington, D.C., a rally for Gaza, in which protesters marched to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters, took place adjacent to the main “Hands Off” rally. And a lot of signs framed Trump and billionaire Elon Musk as posing a fascist threat to the country.\n\nPeople gather for the \"Hands Off!\" protest against the policies of President Donald Trump and his adviser, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, outside the Michigan Capitol in Lansing, Mich., on April 5. Jeff Kowlasky / AFP / Getty Images\n\nThe broad scope of the protests mirrors the broad scope of Trump’s assault on our republic — and underscores how big of a tent the anti-Trump coalition is going to need to be to effectively resist Trump’s dismantling of the administrative state, social services and democratic institutions.\n\nTo be sure, though it’s been on a smaller scale and less noticed, there actually has been a lot of protest activity in the first few months of Trump’s second administration. Indivisible, a liberal grassroots network, was effective in encouraging outraged citizens to go to town halls to make noise and hold Republicans accountable — so much so that the National Republican Congressional Committee advised GOP lawmakers to stop attending town halls rather than face their constituents’ wrath. Musk’s Tesla has been the object of boycotts and protests that appear to be hurting its bottom line. Anti-DOGE protests have taken place across the country for months. And while the Democratic Party leadership has largely shown itself to be feckless and is increasingly losing the trust of its members, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has been drawing huge crowds in swing states across the U.S. with his “Fighting Oligarchy” Tour.\n\nDemonstrators gather outside the Minnesota State Capitol during the nationwide \"Hands Off!\" protest, in St. Paul, Minn., on April 5. Kerem Yucel / AFP / Getty Images\n\nIt can be easy to overestimate the significance of a single protest, even a huge one. One-off protests can be forgotten rather quickly in an era where the news cycle moves at an unfathomable speed. And it’s relatively easy to get people to object to something; it’s far harder to get them to organize around a widely desired alternative.\n\nStill, registering dissent is an important democratic exercise, and reports of older first-time protesters coming out to say “no” to Trump are positive signs. As the republic teeters on the edge of myriad crises, the left is exhausted and afraid. But on Saturday it reminded us it’s still here, and it’s not going to go quietly into the night.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Florida police recently arrested a transgender woman for using the women’s restroom in the state Capitol in Tallahassee, in what is believed to be the first such arrest in a state with an anti-trans bathroom ban.\n\nMarcy Rheintgen, a 20-year-old college student and Illinois resident, was arrested March 19 on a trespassing charge after she used a women’s restroom in a protest against Florida’s law barring people from using bathrooms that don’t align with their assigned sex at birth in government-owned or -leased buildings.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Rheintgen had sent letters to every Florida state lawmaker to inform them that she planned to use a restroom at the statehouse that corresponded with her gender identity. She included a photo of herself for identification, the Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\n“I know that you know in your heart that this law is wrong and unjust. I know that you know in your heart that transgender people are human too, and that you can’t arrest us away,” she wrote. “I know that you know that I have dignity. That’s why I know that you won’t arrest me.”\n\nJon Davidson, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told the AP that Rheintgen’s arrest is the first of its kind that ACLU’s attorneys are aware of in any state with a bathroom ban.\n\nRheintgen, who the AP reported had been visiting her grandparents, was freed on pretrial release the day after her arrest, according to the Miami Herald. If convicted on the misdemeanor trespassing charge, she could face up to 60 days in jail.\n\nRheintgen told the AP that she wanted to show “the absurdity of this law in practice.”\n\n“If I’m a criminal, it’s going to be so hard for me to live a normal life, all because I washed my hands,” she said, adding that she was “horrified and scared” over what might happen next.\n\nNadine Smith, the executive director of Equality Florida, an LGBTQ civil rights organization, said in a statement that Rheintgen’s arrest was not about safety, but “about cruelty, humiliation, and the deliberate erosion of human dignity.”\n\n“Transgender people have been using restrooms aligned with their gender for generations without incident,” Smith wrote. “What’s changed is not their presence — it’s a wave of laws designed to intimidate them out of public life.”\n\nFlorida is one of more than a dozen states with a bathroom ban, though Utah is the only other state to criminalize the act. In recent years, GOP lawmakers across the country have passed legislation to crack down on trans rights and strip protections — a pattern that the Trump administration has mirrored on the federal level as well.",

    "title": "Elon Musk’s X reacts to reports of potential penalties from the E.U.",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "The New York Times reported Thursday that the European Union may soon levy penalties against Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, under an E.U. law aimed at curbing disinformation, hate speech and other harmful content.\n\nIn July, the E.U. released preliminary findings of an investigation that found X had violated the Digital Services Act. Specifically, the E.U. concluded that:\n\nX’s interface for so-called verified accounts was not in line with industry practice and had been abused by “malicious actors” to deceive users.\n\nX has created barriers that hinder transparency about advertisements, thwarting “required supervision and research into emerging risks brought about by the distribution of advertising online.”\n\nX doesn’t comply with the Digital Services Act’s rules around providing public data to researchers who can use it to study the spread of things like disinformation.\n\nThe New York Times, citing four people with knowledge of the E.U.’s plans who declined to be identified because of the ongoing investigation, reported that penalties are expected to be announced this summer. The report has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News.\n\nThese days, X is a political weapon more than anything else. And Europe is right to want to regulate it.\n\nEarlier this year, Musk seemed to demonstrate how necessary the E.U.’s precautions are when he used X to spread disinformation in hopes of swaying voters toward the far-right, Nazi-friendly Alternative for Deutschland party, or AfD, in Germany’s snap elections. The platform also has apparently quashed dissent against Turkey’s illiberal regime and promoted disinformation in support of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who stands accused of attempting a coup — to say nothing of the ways it’s been used to spread disinformation in the U.S.\n\nThese days, X is a political weapon more than anything else. And Europe is right to want to regulate it.\n\nPredictably, the E.U.’s efforts to deter disinformation and hate speech have angered President Donald Trump and members of his administration, both of which are widely known to promote disinformation and hateful rhetoric online. The White House recently released a memo attacking the Digital Services Act, claiming it unfairly targets American companies and vowing that such regulations “will face scrutiny from the Administration.”\n\nOn Thursday, X’s Global Government Affairs team posted a statement saying that the platform “has gone above and beyond to comply with the EU’s Digital Services Act, and we will use every option at our disposal to defend our business, keep our users safe, and protect freedom of speech in Europe.”\n\nThat seems utterly detached from the clear dangers that Musk’s platform has posed to democracy and, frankly, public safety. But when you’re accustomed to operating free from oversight, accountability can feel like oppression.",

    "content": "UPDATE (April 7, 2025, 4:02 p.m. ET): Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday halted a lower court order that would’ve required the Trump administration to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States from El Salvador by midnight. Litigation will continue in the case, with further possible rulings to come in the future from Roberts or the full court in the matter.\n\nThe Trump administration once again turns to the Supreme Court for emergency relief. This time, it’s ahead of a midnight deadline to return a man to the U.S. who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.\n\nThe federal government admits what it called an “administrative error” in sending Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. But it told the high court Monday that having done so “does not license district courts to seize control over foreign relations, treat the Executive Branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight.”\n\nThe federal government admits what it called an “administrative error” in sending Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.\n\nThe district court in this case is a Maryland federal judge, Obama appointee Paula Xinis, who issued the order and deadline that the administration wants the justices to upend. In the pending high court application, the recently confirmed solicitor general, John Sauer, called her action “unprecedented” in “dictating to the United States that it must not only negotiate with a foreign country to return an enemy alien on foreign soil, but also succeed by 11:59 p.m. tonight.”\n\nThe president nominated Sauer to the prestigious post — representing the federal government at the Supreme Court — after the lawyer represented Donald Trump in the appeal in which a divided high court granted Trump broad criminal immunity last year as he ran for office again.\n\nThe administration failed to get a Richmond, Virginia-based federal appeals court to halt Xinis’ order. In separate opinions explaining their views Monday, judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the government “has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process”; that the government’s contrary arguments are “unconscionable”; and that there’s “no question that the government screwed up here.”\n\nGuards lead a man Jennifer Vasquez Sura identified as her husband, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, through the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador. U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland via AP\n\nJustifying her order in an opinion over the weekend, Xinis wrote that the government acknowledged it “had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador — let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nAs to the government’s claim that he’s an MS-13 gang member, she wrote: “The ‘evidence’ against Abrego Garcia consisted of nothing more than his Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie, and a vague, uncorroborated allegation from a confidential informant claiming he belonged to MS-13’s ‘Western’ clique in New York — a place he has never lived.”\n\nMonday’s application is one of several emergency motions pending before the justices in which the administration wants relief from adverse rulings from lower courts. In resolving one of those motions on Friday, related to the canceling of education-related grants, the court sided with the administration in a contentious 5-4 decision.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "The Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration Friday in litigation over education-related grants, splitting 5-4 with Republican appointees in the majority. Chief Justice John Roberts and the three Democratic appointees dissented.\n\nThe administration had asked the high court to halt a Massachusetts federal trial judge’s order that, the Justice Department wrote, “requires the government to immediately reinstate millions of dollars in federal grants that had been lawfully terminated.”\n\nThe court granted the government emergency relief in an unsigned opinion on Friday. The majority halted the district court order pending appeal, reasoning in part that the states arguing against the federal government in this case “have represented in this litigation that they have the financial wherewithal to keep their programs running. So, if respondents ultimately prevail, they can recover any wrongfully withheld funds through suit in an appropriate forum.”\n\nBut in one of the dissents, Justice Elena Kagan called the majority’s decision a “mistake.” She wrote that the federal government didn’t even defend the legality of canceling the grants at issue. “And contra the per curiam [majority opinion], the respondent States have consistently represented that the loss of these grants will force them — indeed, has already forced them — to curtail teacher training programs,” she wrote.\n\nIn another dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the majority’s “eagerness to insert itself into this early stage of ongoing litigation over the lawfulness of the Department’s actions — even when doing so facilitates the infliction of significant harms on the Plaintiff States, and even though the Government has not bothered to press any argument that the Department’s harm‐causing conduct is lawful — is equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate. It is also entirely unwarranted.”\n\nJoined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Jackson noted that the high court doesn’t “ordinarily exercise jurisdiction over TROs [temporary restraining orders], and this one is no different.” She added that the federal government hasn’t “articulated any concrete harm it will suffer if the grant terminations are not implemented in the next three days.”\n\nRoberts did not write his own dissent, but rather the opinion simply reflects a notation that he would’ve denied the application.\n\nThe appeal stemmed from the administration’s decision to terminate grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. “Yet the district court’s order is enabling many of those grantees to request payments on their grants, which grantees now have an incentive to do quickly,” acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in the March 26 application.\n\nShe highlighted an example of a grant that, she wrote, “funded a project that involved a ‘racial and ethnic autobiography’ that asked whether individuals ever ‘felt threatened? marginalized? privileged?’ and how they would ‘seek to challenge power imbalances.’” Another, she wrote, “sought to ensure that teachers were ‘purposeful in implementing cultural and SEL [social-emotional learning]/DEI practices with fidelity.’”\n\nThe appeal came as the Trump administration seeks to dismantle the Education Department. It also represented just one of the administration’s several recent complaints to the high court about lower court judges running amok in the administration’s view. Harris wrote that the case “exemplifies a flood of recent suits that raise the question: ‘Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever)’ millions in taxpayer dollars?”\n\nShe was quoting from Justice Samuel Alito’s dissent from the court’s March 5 refusal to help the government avoid paying nearly $2 billion in foreign aid funds for already completed work. The court split 5-4 in that case, and the administration wants to flip that dissent to a majority as it presses a series of urgent appeals in the early days of Trump’s second term.\n\nFriday’s decision therefore represents at least a temporarily significant victory for the administration. Whether it reflects an outlier or the start of a trend could become clearer with several other emergency decisions pending on immigration, employment and birthright citizenship.\n\nOpposing the application, a coalition of states led by California wrote that the federal government was seeking extraordinary relief from the justices that it wasn’t entitled to. The states noted that the government was asking not only to halt the lower court’s temporary restraining order but also to summarily overturn it.\n\nIn addition, the states accused the government of taking its problems with other cases out on this one.\n\n“It appears that defendants’ real concern is not with this case or the courts below; it is with other cases in other ‘forums across the country’ where courts are grappling with a raft of legal disputes arising out of recent actions by the Executive Branch,” the states wrote, citing the administration’s application and adding: “Those concerns are properly litigated in the context of those other cases.”\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

    "title": "A lawsuit opposing Trump's tariffs rightly cites the Constitution",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "The details of President Donald Trump’s promised tariffs have been announced, and as many Americans are mourning what the plummeting stock market is doing to their 401(k) plans and investment accounts, others are asking if his tariffs are even legal. Does Trump, or any American president, really have the power to unilaterally impose these tariffs?\n\nDoes Trump, or any American president, really have the power to unilaterally impose these tariffs?\n\nA Florida company that sells stationery supplies believes he doesn’t, and on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Trump and other members of his administration, alleging that the president lacks the ability to impose tariffs on China. The suit’s argument, boiled down, is that while Trump claims he has the power to levy these tariffs under a federal statute called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (“IEEPA”), he does not have such power.\n\nWe knew that legal challenges to the Trump tariffs would come and that they’d argue that Trump had exceeded the admittedly broad authority Congress has granted presidents.\n\nThere is perhaps a more foundational question, though. Why is a president imposing tariffs at all, when the Constitution grants that power to Congress? You wouldn’t necessarily know it if you’ve been listening to the president, but the Constitution assigns the power to regulate foreign commerce and impose tariffs to Congress, not the White House.\n\nSo why does Trump believe that he has the power to do what he’s doing? The answer is that for almost a century, Congress has ceded much of its authority to regulate foreign commerce to the president. Congress’ abdication of responsibility allowed presidents to usurp that power and impose their own will on our global trading partners. And, as we see with the tumbling stock marking, putting such decisions in the hands of one person can bring potentially disastrous results. This is not what the founders intended. Those who drafted our Constitution envisioned a government of truly shared power, between three co-equal branches, two of them political. Sadly, on the issue of imposing tariffs, the legislative branch hobbled itself to the benefit of the executive branch.\n\nIn 1934, in the middle of the Great Depression, Congress delegated much of its authority when it passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, giving the president the power to negotiate trade agreements and make certain changes to U.S. tariff rates without congressional approval. Thus, Franklin D. Roosevelt, our country’s 32nd president, was the first one granted the power to unilaterally alter tariffs.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, our country’s 32nd president, was the first one granted the power to unilaterally alter tariffs\n\nThree decades later, in 1962, Congress passed the Trade Expansion Act, which gives the president the power to change tariffs based on an investigation and determination by the Department of Commerce that some imports pose a national security threat. During his first administration, Trump used this power much more liberally than his predecessors, and he twice imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum pursuant to his power under that law’s Section 232. He is relying on the same section of that law this term to reimpose tariffs on steel and aluminum, which he alleges are necessary to maintain national security.\n\nTwelve years after the Trade Expansion Act, Congress relinquished even more power over foreign commerce to the executive branch. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 gives the U.S. trade representative, a Cabinet member, the power to impose trade sanctions on foreign countries when they break trade agreements or harm U.S. commerce by taking actions that are “unjustifiable” or “unreasonable.” Indeed, the Trump administration cited Section 301 when it imposed “reciprocal tariffs” this week. Trump has argued that China has broken one or more trade agreements, thus providing a pathway to impose sanctions (aka tariffs) on goods imported from there.\n\nEmily Ley Paper, the Florida company that sued the Trump administration on Thursday, argued that the government is seeking to illegally “bypass” those trade statutes. The suit focuses on yet another statute, the above-mentioned IEEPA, arguing that it does not provide the president the power to impose taxes. In fact, the suit points out that no president has ever used that law to impose tariffs. The plaintiffs argue that, even if the IEEPA does provide presidents with the power to levy tariffs, that is only the case when there is a national emergency that trade sanctions can alleviate.\n\nTrump says his tariffs are a response to the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the United States. But the plaintiffs allege that there is no real connection between the tariffs on China and the opioid crisis.\n\nWhile there may be an inclination to think that the conservative U.S. Supreme Court might bless the Trump administration’s broad claim of executive authority, the type of challenge we see being made in Thursday’s lawsuit might gain new traction with the court for three reasons spelled out in that lawsuit.\n\nUnder what’s called the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot simply throw up its hands and delegate its constitutionally mandated duties to the executive branch.\n\nFirst, there’s the foundational argument that Congress simply ceded too much authority to the president. The Constitution gave the power to impose tariffs to Congress. Though Congress gave that power away to another branch of government 150 years later, it may not have had the power to do that. Under what’s called the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot simply throw up its hands and delegate its constitutionally mandated duties to the executive branch. While it’s true that in 1976 the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a portion of Section 232 on the Trade Expansion Act was not an unconstitutional delegation of power from Congress to the president, that Supreme Court differed greatly from the one we have now. Chief Justice John Roberts’ conservative court may be willing to revisit this case, or at least embrace a more robust view of the nondelegation doctrine.\n\nA second related argument is that Congress has violated the “major questions doctrine,” under which Congress must provide clear authorization before an executive agency can decide an issue of national significance.\n\nAlthough the history of our courts indicates that judges will generally defer to the president’s decisions in this area, a recent Supreme Court case provides yet a third reason to wonder if Trump’s power will be checked in this case. In June 2024, Roberts wrote the opinion overturning the doctrine of “Chevron deference” and concluded that courts should exercise independent judgment and not defer to an executive agency’s interpretation of a congressional statute when it is ambiguous. This would allow courts to perform a more searching review of actions that Trump takes under the congressional statutes authorizing him to impose tariffs in certain circumstances.\n\nA federal judge or the Supreme Court may pump the breaks on Trump’s tariffs. But the best solution to this problem that’s destroying Americans’ investment accounts is not to rely on the judiciary. It is instead for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority and claw back the power it should have never given (and may not have been constitutionally allowed to give) to the White House.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "As of Friday, the Texas Department of State Health Services had reported 481 confirmed cases of measles, which would put the total number of cases in the U.S. well over 600 since the start of the year. During all of 2024, fewer than 300 measles cases were reported across the entire United States.\n\nAnother thing is showing up in the routine lab work for unvaccinated children with measles: liver damage.\n\nMore than 50 children have been hospitalized in Texas, and the vast majority of cases and hospitalizations are occurring in unvaccinated kids. One unvaccinated school-age child has died. In addition to measles itself, another thing is showing up in the routine lab work for unvaccinated children with measles: liver damage. According to the physicians treating such children at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, vitamin A toxicity from high doses of cod liver oil is the most likely culprit.\n\nCod liver oil, which Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has touted in several Fox News interviews as a cure and prophylaxis for measles, contains a rich amount of vitamin A. Symptoms of vitamin A toxicity include dry skin, fatigue, blurred vision, bone pain and the above-mentioned liver damage. In some cases, too much vitamin A can cause a person to fall into a coma or even die.\n\nSince the beginning of the measles outbreak in Texas, Kennedy has downplayed the role of vaccines in preventing measles. In a March 2 op-ed that he wrote for Fox News’ website, he claims to care about the dissemination of “accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy” and says vaccines should be available “for all those who want them.”\n\nBut in the same piece, Kennedy writes that it is also “our responsibility to provide up-to-date guidance on available therapeutic medications.” That’s when he argues that the “CDC has recently updated their recommendation supporting administration of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate, and severe infection. Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality.”\n\nDespite Kennedy’s claims that cod liver oil, steroids and antibiotics can be used to prevent or treat measles, the only evidence-based method that has been shown to prevent against a measles infection is vaccination. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two shots of the MMR vaccine provides 97% protection against the disease.\n\nSymptoms of vitamin A toxicity include dry skin, fatigue, blurred vision, bone pain and liver damage. In some cases, too much vitamin A can cause a person to fall into a coma or even die.\n\nChildren showing up at hospitals with vitamin A toxicity underscores the importance of effective communication of lifesaving information.\n\nWith the exception of measles cases that are the result of international travelers bringing it into the U.S., the disease has spread across 19 states because of misinformation. Instead of deliberately and intentionally advocating for parents to inoculate their children against measles, as every responsible public health official should, Kennedy has instead expressed support for alternative therapies that are proven not to prevent measles.\n\nWords matter, particularly the words from leaders who have the power and influence to shape public behavior. Words have consequences, and we can see the results of inaccurate public health messaging in Texas. Parents are deciding on alternative therapies to treat measles rather than giving their children the vaccines that science shows prevent infection.\n\nThese parents are causing their own children to suffer. No otherwise healthy child should be in the hospital. They should be enjoying their childhood playing outside with family and friends. Instead, these children with vitamin A toxicity are being hospitalized, put on medications and being given fluids intravenously.\n\nThe vast majority of the measles cases across the United States, and certainly all the hospitalized cases, could be entirely prevented with vaccines. The measles outbreak will not improve until vaccination rates improve and a concerted effort is made to combat the rise of vaccine hesitancy that Kennedy and other anti-vaccine advocates have push onto many Americans. To that end, our influential public health leaders must provide clarity and transparency when discussing and educating the public about how to prevent measles.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on his nomination on Jan. 29. Alex Wroblewski / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nIt is not enough to claim that vaccines are an important part of measles prevention but then promote cod liver oil, antibiotics and steroids for therapy when an active measles outbreak is affecting hundreds of Americans. Lives are at stake. One child has already died, and that’s one too many.\n\nIf innocent children continue to suffer and be hospitalized for a completely preventable disease, shouldn’t leaders who are spreading misinformation be held accountable? Where is the justice for the dozens of people, most of them children, who are suffering in Texas hospitals because their parents used remedies recommended by irresponsible government officials?\n\nIn a time where misinformation can spread swiftly through social and mass media, we need real public health leaders who can communicate effectively and clearly. The lives of our children depend upon it.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Louisiana gets hot. Brutally hot in the summer. In 2023, New Orleans had about 20 sweaty nights when the temperature never dipped below 80 degrees. Ours is the kind of heat that requires air conditioning to sleep, and it often feels like we need AC just to breathe.\n\nImagine you’re already struggling with the high cost of living. Your rent has spiked, your grocery bill has spiked even more, it’s summer in Louisiana, and because you can’t afford your $350 electricity bill, you receive a disconnection notice. How do you survive?\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has fired the 10-person staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.\n\nThat’s a question about 6 million American families will be asking now that President Donald Trump’s administration has fired the 10-person staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.\n\nA bipartisan effort to protect America’s most vulnerable households, LIHEAP has been around since 1981, but now it’s one of the many federal programs that is seriously threatened in the latest round of stunning layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. While the dollars are dispensed to residents by locally trusted community action agencies, LIHEAP is a federal program with experienced administrators who ensure the funds are put to best use. Again, every one of the program’s administrators has been fired.\n\nTens of thousands of elderly or disabled residents and households with children depend on lifesaving support from LIHEAP to stay safe in Louisiana’s extreme summers. Our state receives roughly $53 million annually to help people manage electric and gas bills.\n\nLIHEAP is fundamentally about helping vulnerable Americans pay their home energy bills. But it’s much more than that. Energy costs are housing costs, and when a family falls behind on utilities, the effects can cascade, leading to the loss of housing, food, health care and other essentials. Unfortunately, disconnections for inability to pay are already on the rise, causing illness and death. Between June and August 2023, extreme heat in Louisiana cost 25 people their lives, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.\n\nI run the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a policy organization in Louisiana working to ensure everyone has access to the energy they need to thrive. Residents threatened with disconnection call us year-round, and we direct them to LIHEAP, which helps them make ends meet when they are forced to choose between food and medication or keeping the lights on. There’s a good reason LIHEAP is a health program.\n\nBut LIHEAP isn’t just about paying bills. The program has also provided millions of dollars each year to help weatherize homes. Many of our homes are ill-equipped to keep occupants safe, healthy and comfortable during July’s heat dome or January’s polar vortex, and LIHEAP weatherization funds help reduce wasted energy, which saves us all money in the long run. Weatherization includes sealing up leaks around doors and windows, installing insulation and making air-conditioning systems more efficient. The Weatherization Assistance Program, which is largely funded by LIHEAP, is an investment that puts money directly into homes, reducing the need for bill assistance in the future. To paraphrase the old parable, give a family cash assistance and they can pay their bills that month; weatherize that family’s home, and they’ll be able to afford their bills year-round.\n\nUtilities around the country also depend on LIHEAP revenue to cover their costs when their customers can’t pay. If utilities aren’t able to meet their operating costs, then they’ll need to turn to their regulators and ask for rate increases, and rate increases raise everyone’s bills. This means that LIHEAP has benefited every American household for nearly 45 years. You’ve benefited from it, even if you’ve never applied for help. This administration keeps using the word “efficiency,” but this appears to be yet another cut that make things generally less efficient and hurts not only the most vulnerable people who apply to LIHEAP, but all of us.\n\nIt’s been surprising that the LIHEAP staff being fired hasn’t led to broad objections from regulators and utilities nationwide. Utilities have historically been very outspoken advocates for LIHEAP and have joined consumer advocates and community action agencies in annually lobbying Congress for more funds. That’s because the program has always been underfunded. But according to a piece by the Energy and Policy Institute, since the firing of the LIHEAP staff was announced April 1, utilities have largely stayed mum or refused to comment either on the impacts it will have on their customers or on their own bottom lines. It is puzzling and concerning that some of the most powerful voices on this issue are staying silent.\n\nTemperatures in some part of Louisiana reached 89 degrees Thursday, and as spring gives way to the even more intense heat of summer, I worry about the tens of thousands of Louisianans who are already barely making ends meet and can’t access LIHEAP funds. These layoffs and federal cost-cutting measures are dangerous, and every legislator, regulator and utility has a responsibility to protect programs like LIHEAP, a program that is a clear example of how government efficiency and “cost saving” is already being achieved, even as millions of Americans are helped.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the April 7 episode of “Morning Joe.”\n\nThe markets are in crisis following Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs announcement last week, with experts warning that a recession could be on the horizon. According to a new survey from CNBC, a majority of CEOs, 69%, now say they expect a recession. That comes just days after JPMorgan’s economics team raised their recession probability to 60%.\n\nThe administration has tried to brush off these recession fears, sending out their top officials to defend Trump’s tariffs and pretend like there’s nothing to see here. Trump’s ultra-wealthy Cabinet members, like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, are taking to the airwaves to tell middle-class and working-class Americans, entrepreneurs, people who have spent their entire lives building up their family businesses, that “there’s nothing to worry about; this had to be done.”\n\nIf you hear Republicans saying they can’t do anything, that’s just a lie.\n\nAlthough the focus right now is on the stock market and the banks, the people who will be hurt most by Trump’s trade war aren’t the millionaires and billionaires in his administration, it’s working-class Americans — the people who can afford it the least. And right now, those hardworking Americans are being told by Trump’s billionaire buddies that there’s nothing to see here.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about tariffs, what we’re witnessing is a self-induced war that Trump, with the backing of the Republican Party, started.\n\nSince November’s election, I have been warning Republicans that they needed to be careful. The U.S. has the strongest economy in the world, but it has to be managed wisely. And now, Republicans are standing by as Trump drives that strong economy into the ground.\n\nRepublicans are not powerless here. The GOP-controlled Congress has the power to stop Trump’s trade war. They have the power to moderate it. They have the constitutional power to decide if 46% tariffs are too much to push on Vietnam. They have the power to make this less tough on American businesses. They have the power to talk and negotiate with the president and come up with something that’s not quite as extreme. If you hear Republicans saying they can’t do anything, that’s just a lie.\n\nAmericans can’t fall for these lies. They must understand that when this administration goes on television and says that this has to be done, they’re not telling the truth. And when Republicans refuse to stand up to Trump and tell the American people they can’t do anything about it, that’s not true either. It’s doublespeak.",

    "title": "Trump’s attacks on law firms aim to alter the balance of power in American democracy",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "The Trump administration’s recent executive actions targeting some of the country’s most prominent law firms should not be mistaken for routine political conflict. These moves signal a deeper strategy to weaken Democratic-leaning institutions and profoundly and permanently alter the balance of power in American democracy.\n\nAs political scientists who have studied the politics of the legal profession, we recognize Trump’s executive orders as part of a broader pattern. Like elite university professors and students, the legal profession, particularly at its highest levels, tilts to the left. Our research shows that lawyers are significantly more liberal than the general population. This ideological bent is especially pronounced at the nation’s top law schools — the very institutions that produce the attorneys at the firms targeted.\n\nThe firms Trump targeted first were not chosen randomly.\n\nThis isn’t just a reflection of educational polarization, in which higher levels of education increasingly correlate with left-leaning political views. Even compared with other highly educated professionals, such as doctors and business leaders, lawyers are among the most reliably left-leaning. That reality ironically makes “Big Law” — despite its traditional role defending big businesses and moneyed interests — a formidable adversary for an administration seemingly intent on dismantling opposition piece by piece.\n\nAnd the firms Trump targeted first were not chosen randomly. These firms do not just employ some left-leaning lawyers; they are among the most liberal in the country. Our analysis finds that WilmerHale, Paul Weiss, Jenner & Block, and Perkins Coie — all firms that have been prominently targeted by Trump in recent weeks — rank in the most left-leaning quartile of top American law firms. WilmerHale, Jenner & Block, and Paul Weiss sit within the top 25 most liberal law firms nationwide.\n\nThese firms also don’t just lean left; they are Democratic power centers, deeply embedded in the intersection of law and politics. They exert influence in many ways: direct lobbying, fighting critical court battles over voting rights and providing campaign cash through donations and fundraising. Many federal judges and candidates, as well as staffers for Democratic presidential administrations, come from these firms. Perkins Coie, the first firm targeted by Trump, frequently represents Democratic Party interests.\n\nBut Trump’s targeting of law firms goes beyond mere partisan retribution. Policy is forged not only through legislation and regulation but also through litigation. Law firms are central actors in this, often acting as critical counterweights to government power. Their ability to bring complex cases, backed by resources and expertise — often deployed via pro bono efforts — makes them essential players.\n\nBy kneecapping some of the most effective legal adversaries on the left, Trump is attempting to tilt the scales in conservatives’ favor — not through victories in the courtroom, but through the outright elimination of the opposition.\n\nDisturbingly, Trump’s pressure is yielding results.\n\nBarring firms from obtaining security clearances, threatening government contracts, or restricting federal employee contact — key provisions in these executive orders — doesn’t just deprive law firms of clients; it cripples their ability to function effectively across numerous practice areas, potentially denying due process to numerous clients. The goal is clear: to sap these firms of their power, marginalize their influence and send a chilling message to any other legal entity contemplating a challenge to administration policy or actions.\n\nDisturbingly, Trump’s pressure is yielding results. Though firms like Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Perkins Coie are challenging these orders in court, others have bent the knee. The settlements by Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps — in which they agreed to provide millions in legal services for causes favored by the administration — have emboldened the president and his administration to continue their campaign of intimidation.\n\nWe have criticized the legal profession in the past for its resistance to public oversight and its outsize political influence. In turn the bar has continued to claim a unique position for lawyers as guardians of democracy. Having carved out and defended this privileged position — deserved or not — the legal establishment now faces a defining moment. Lawyers cannot credibly claim a special role in protecting democratic norms while simultaneously compromising with those undermining them.\n\nThe stakes for the legal profession are high. The more firms respond in isolation, hoping to avoid Trump’s ire, the easier it will be for Trump to pick them off one by one. An independent, robust and liberal-leaning legal profession presents too much of a risk to the Trump administration. The entire profession — Big Law, the legal academy and bar associations — must present a unified front to resist these encroachments, something we have begun seeing with the news that more than 500 firms have voiced support to Perkins Coie in its legal fight against the administration. Bar associations, which set ethical rules that lawyers must follow, will be particularly important in mandating that law firms not be punished for the clients they represent. With individual partners nervous about losing business, it is crucial that firms, law schools and bar associations be more vocal.\n\nBecause if they don’t, they may not only lose the battle for their profession, but we may lose a critical pillar of how U.S. democracy operates.",

    "title": "Watch tonight's 'White Lotus' Season 3 finale for its surprise star: Aimee Lou Wood's teeth",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Actress Aimee Lou Wood, one of the surprise standouts of the third season of “The White Lotus,” is having what she describes as a “full circle” moment ahead of Sunday’s season finale. Amid a cast stacked with the likes of Parker Posey, Walton Goggins and Carrie Coon, an unlikely new star has emerged: Wood’s buckteeth.\n\nWood’s character, a young woman named Chelsea, meets Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon), another resort guest, early in the HBO drama. In one of the most memorable lines of the season, Chloe breaks the ice with disarming candor. “I love your teeth,” she tells a smiling Chelsea. “You’re from England, right?”\n\nWood later told the online magazine The Face that the line was actually improvised, beautiful in its simplicity.\n\nCalled ‘radical’ and ‘inspiring,’ Wood’s decision not to ‘fix’ her teeth has earned her fans — a lot of them.\n\nCalled “radical” and “inspiring,” Wood’s decision not to “fix” her teeth has earned her fans — a lot of them. Some are so fascinated with Wood’s overbite — a flare complete with a large space between her two front teeth — that the actress has felt compelled to warn against overeager DIY copycats. Dentists and orthodontists meanwhile have taken to TikTok to diagnose Wood’s dental condition, sight unseen.\n\nFans can be extraordinarily ridiculous; this is not a new phenomenon. In Victoria-era Britain, Alexandra, the Princess of Wales, developed a limp after a case of rheumatic fever. Before long, her female fans and followers decided to imitate the so-called “Alexandra Limp,” with some going so far as to purchase shoes with mismatched heels in order to achieve it.\n\nBut for those of us with a wild set of chompers, Wood’s claim to fame is both welcome and bittersweet. My own malocclusion (the medical term for teeth that dare to exist one way or another in misalignment) combined with a set of cruel and vicious peers made my childhood a living hell.\n\nLike Wood, I suffered years of intermittent bullying, with some of the worst abuse delivered by adults. Anyone with a craniofacial anomaly (another fancy term for anyone born with facial structure that dares to deviate from the socially accepted norm) knows that living with defiant teeth can be brutal. In my case, the bullying and unsolicited criticism was life-altering.\n\nMy own experiences inspired a bestselling children’s book on the same topic, so I also know what it’s like to face your pain and come out the other side triumphant. But unlike Wood, I’ve never met an orthodontist or dentist who said they “wouldn’t change a thing” about my teeth or smile — even after extensive treatment.\n\nI remember when, at 23 years old, I moved from New York City to suburban New Jersey and found a new local dentist. After the standard pleasantries, he tapped my front teeth with his pointer finger and said, “This isn’t very nice.”\n\nSuch moments, beginning around the time I turned 8 years old, shaped what became a lifetime of severe body dysmorphia. I endured three separate rounds of braces across three decades to correct an overbite. My stubborn front teeth, however, resisted even the most modern orthodontic technology. Mine is a deeply structural problem. I was born with misaligned jaws that could only be corrected with orthognathic surgery.\n\nMy dysmorphia has proven just as entrenched. Despite various (and expensive) treatments, I am still unable to imagine my teeth as anything other than socially unacceptable. And I envy Wood’s seeming self-acceptance.\n\nBut while cultural attitudes do seem to be changing in Hollywood and on fashion runways, it’s a slow process.\n\nBut while cultural attitudes do seem to be changing in Hollywood and on fashion runways, it’s a slow process.\n\nAccording to 2022 data published by the the American Association of Orthodontists, there are over 3 million children between the ages of 8 and 17 receiving orthodontic treatment. A good chunk of orthodontic patients, around a 25% or more, are adults. Indeed, according to the British Orthodontic Society, demand for orthodontic treatment is increasing in Britain.\n\nBut this quest for the perfect smile is often wildly expensive, even for “easier” cases.\n\nIt’s also impermanent. Teeth shift as we grow older. When I finished my third round of braces 13 years ago, my teeth were perfect. But I knew I would have to wear retainers and a bite guard for the rest of my life in order to maintain all of that grueling work. And even despite these efforts, my teeth have shifted.\n\nWood, of course, is also a beautiful, thin white young woman and an excellent actress. In this context, her “perfectly imperfect” teeth arguably add to her appeal in a way that might not be true for someone less conventionally attractive. I also don’t think that words like novel or inspiring are the compliments people seem to think they are — instead, they suggest just how brainwashed we’ve become when it comes to conventional beauty. The reactions also highlight an enduring sense of entitlement; an intense need to judge others, and especially to judge their bodies. This entitlement, as both Wood and I have experienced, can be life-altering for those on the receiving end.\n\nWhile I could have really used Wood’s newfound notoriety when I was growing up, it shouldn’t take a celebrity’s “radical” natural features for the rest of us to feel a little more socially acceptable.",

    "title": "Trump wants the Federal Reserve to bail him out",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Though the Trump administration inherited a strong economy, in under three months, it has generated a steep stock market sell-off and deep concerns about where things are headed. The market losses Thursday and Friday were worse than 99.9% of all trading days since 1929, and Monday morning brought even further declines. This historical sell-off was without doubt the result of Trump’s big “Liberation Day,” when he revealed a set of tariffs that raises the average U.S. tax on imports to levels not seen in almost a century.\n\nTariffs of this magnitude pose an especially tough challenge for the economy. Because they are largely passed forward to consumers, they raise prices. And because they similarly raise the price of inputs for domestic producers — 45% of our imports are “intermediate goods” — they raise the cost of production, which hurts growth. Add to these woes the tremendous uncertainty created by Trump’s on-again, off-again policy lurching, along with the aforementioned market meltdown, and you understand a) why both consumer and investor sentiment has fallen off a cliff, and b) why economic forecasters have lowered their growth expectations and raised their inflation forecasts.\n\nFaced with stagflation, what’s a central banker to do?\n\nThis combination of lower growth and faster inflation is called stagflation, and it is a particular challenge for the Federal Reserve. To counteract slower growth, Fed officials can lower the benchmark interest rate they control. But to counteract inflationary pressures, they typically raise rates. Faced with stagflation, what’s a central banker to do?\n\nTheir best play is to leave rates where they are until it is clear which problem requires addressing with a rate change. In fact, that’s just what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday. Given that the appropriate path for Fed policy is “not clear at this time,” he said, “it feels like we don’t need to be in a hurry.”\n\nSo, what’s the problem? Well, here’s what the president posted on Truth Social that same day, as the stock market was tanking: “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates. He is always “late,” but he could now change his image, and quickly.”\n\n“CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!” Trump concluded.\n\nNow, to understand what’s going on here, we need to go back to one of Powell’s predecessors, Alan Greenspan. Under Greenspan, the Fed was so consistent in cutting rates as soon as the market softened that investors came to depend on the Fed chair to protect them from bear markets. This was known as the “Greenspan put,” a reference to a financial tool by which an investor is protected from downside losses.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not saying Trump is an avid student of monetary history. I am saying he wants and expects Powell to bail him out, and he know there’s a precedent for the Fed to provide a macroeconomic insurance policy against a policy shock, even if it’s Trump’s own doing.\n\nIf you let the president oversee the central bank, the risk that he will force it to overly juice the economy is just too high.\n\nHis post also reveals that he’s clearly uninterested in a guiding principle of past administrations, including the Biden presidency, during which I chaired the Council of Economic Advisers. When I was asked about Fed policy, with zero exceptions, my answer was to say nothing. Well, not exactly nothing, but nothing more than this: “We don’t talk about Fed policy because we are fully committed to Fed independence. History is littered with examples of economies severely damaged by the inflation unleashed by pressuring the Fed to cut rates.” In fact, at CEA, we published a detailed defense of this stance, showing the historical importance of Fed independence, especially to control inflation.\n\nIt’s common sense. If you let the president oversee the central bank, the risk that he will force it to overly juice the economy is just too damn high.\n\nThere’s one more important wrinkle here for the Fed to consider. Because a tariff is a tax that takes effect at a point in time and stays on until it’s lifted, it does raise prices, but it does so just once. You get a spike in inflation over a month or two, and then inflation drifts back to where it was pre-tariff. Economists call this a “one-time rise in the price level” versus a permanently higher inflation rate.\n\nThe Fed probably doesn’t like that anymore than you or I do, but as long as inflation doesn’t stay elevated, it doesn't have to raise interest rates to get it back down.\n\nThat could work to Trump’s advantage — unless the tariffs just keep coming. Remember, the scenario I just outlined requires one and done. But if Trump keeps lurching around the way he has since he got back into office, the producers, businesses and employers who set prices and wages in the economy are going to expect ever-higher price pressures.\n\nThis is a huge problem for the Fed that deeply depends on inflationary expectations remaining “anchored.” A one-time hit doesn’t dislodge the anchor. But repeated hits definitely can. As Powell said Friday, “While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent … Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”\n\nThe upshot is that Powell and the Federal Reserve must ignore Trump, maintain independence, watch what happens to both policy and inflation, and raise or lower rates as they see fit. But ignoring Trump is a lot easier said than done. Especially if the markets keep tanking, Trump will demand a “Powell put” with increasing fury. But the Fed chair is unquestionably right about tuning Trump out, and those of us who speak on such matters should give him all the backup we can.",

    "title": "Netflix’s ‘Adolescence’ drags us through the manosphere in search of answers",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "In the third episode of Netflix’s No. 1 hit series, “Adolescence,” 13-year-old Jamie, the boy arrested on suspicion of murdering his classmate Katie with a kitchen knife, speaks with a clinical psychologist. The psychologist is pretty, dressed in a flattering blue chiffon blouse, and exudes a kind of feminine strength. Her appearance matters to Jamie. The episode underscores Jamie’s feelings of inadequacy, his desire for acceptance, his anger and, crucially, the way he views women in relation to himself.\n\nFilmed, like each installment in the series, in one linear shot, the episode is a claustrophobic and gutting watch. In fact the entire four-part series, following Jamie, his family and the police as they attempt to understand what drove this child to violence, is a gripping, necessary lesson in modern day masculinity and the chilling realities young men today face.\n\nSince “Adolescence” premiered on Netflix about three weeks ago, 96.7 million people around the world have streamed it.\n\nSince “Adolescence” premiered on Netflix about three weeks ago, 96.7 million people around the world have streamed it. That number’s likely higher by now. “Adolescence” is the ninth most watched series of all time on Netflix, beating out the third season of the mega-popular “Stranger Things.” I watched it for the first time just a few days ago. I waited because, honestly, it just felt too heavy of a lift.\n\nI’m married just over a year. My husband and I are beginning to talk about children, a family. Sometimes it’s a fun conversation — What would their names be? Would they inherent my husband’s musical abilities and his gentle stoicism? Would they like to read and write like me? — and sometimes it’s a scary, serious conversation. “Adolescence” sparked one such conversation. After watching it, I felt deeply fearful for my future children and for our society.\n\nThe show is an examination of how a confluence of typical factors — cyberbullying, an underfunded school, a lack of community or belonging, coming-of-age angst, an inability to communicate, and the deadly influence of the internet’s “manosphere” — can create an utterly broken and dangerous young man. In her book “The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity and Love,” crucial feminist and civil rights scholar bell hooks writes, “The first act of violence that patriarchy demands of all males is not violence toward women, instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves. If an individual is not successful in emotionally crippling himself, he can count on patriarchal men to enact rituals of power that will assault his self-esteem.”\n\nUltimately, “Adolescence” is a condemnation of patriarchy. For all the discussion around that word, there is a consistent frustrating and fundamental misunderstanding of what patriarchy is. The textbook definition, the social order that gives men a disproportionately larger share of social, economic and political power, doesn’t make it clear that it exists at the cost of both men and women. The patriarchy — this is critical — hurts men.\n\n“Adolescence” also grapples with the dangerous and very real manosphere, the deeply misogynistic faction of the internet pioneered by the likes of self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate. Users often enter the rabbit hole with tutorials on how to charm women, ultimately how to get women to have sex with them and how to be “masculine.” But the further you go, the more misogynistic the content becomes: from deeply regressive gender roles to violence and degradation against women. Fundamentally, the manosphere casts blame on women and feminism for the crisis of male loneliness. In one scene, Jamie brings up the so-called 80-20 rule to his therapist, an obviously incorrect concept that posits 80% of women are attracted to only the “top” 20% of men. The 80-20 rule allows men to, again, cast blame on women for their lack of romantic prospects. Instead of looking inward and examining what might be repelling a possible partner, it’s women’s fault for never giving the other 80% of men a chance. Jamie tells his therapist that he agrees.\n\nI’m one of the lucky ones. I know good men. I have a father who gave me the gift of self-esteem, two brothers with whom I have genuine respectful relationships, and a loving husband who views me as an equal, a partner. I have wonderful uncles, cousins, and friends. I’ve also known bad men. I’ve given out a fake phone number or lied about having a boyfriend to end an uncomfortable interaction. I’ve heard countless men qualify their misogynistic beliefs with a Democratic voting record. I’ve calculated the cost of saying no. I’ve feared for my life while alone with a man. But like I said, I’ve ultimately been lucky.\n\nI’m not yet a parent. I don’t have the answers, nor the experience. I do know one thing, though: I am grateful that I will raise a child in the wake of “Adolescence.”\n\nI’m not yet a parent. I don’t have the answers, nor the experience. I do know one thing, though: I am grateful that I will raise a child in the wake of “Adolescence.” I am grateful for the conversations I hear and read that are happening right now, because of this series. The show and the devastating story it tells has sparked heavy and painful conversations between couples, parents, sons and their parents, sons and their fathers, and, God willing, between young men.\n\nOne of the final scenes in the last episode of “Adolescence” takes place between Jamie’s parents. They sit shoulder-to-shoulder on their neatly made bedspread and discuss, through tears, where they failed their son. “Adolescence” is careful to make it clear that they are not to blame. Jamie didn’t come from a home without love. His heinous act of violence wasn’t born from another heinous act of violence.\n\nThere is no easy fix and there is no single scapegoat. The solution isn’t merely removing cellphones and limiting internet access. The solution isn’t blaming parents, or teachers, or little girls. If we keep talking, though, perhaps we will find one.",

Executives, many of whom backed Donald Trump’s candidacy last year, responded to the White House’s trade tariffs with “anger, anxiety, frustration, and fear.”\n\nThe Times’ report added, “One prominent deals lawyer described himself as ‘flabbergasted’ as he grappled with how far the share prices of his clients had fallen. A top Goldman Sachs executive summed up the frustration with Mr. Trump succinctly: Someone has to stop him.”\n\nOther prominent voices have spoken up in similar ways. Billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman — who backed Trump’s candidacy and publicly defended the then-candidate’s economic agenda during the 2024 campaign — wrote over the weekend, “Business is a confidence game. The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe. The consequences for our country and the millions of our citizens who have supported the president — in particular low-income consumers who are already under a huge amount of economic stress — are going to be severely negative.”\n\nAckman added, “This is not what we voted for.”\n\nReactions like these reminded me of a recent Washington Post column from Catherine Rampell, a new MSNBC anchor, who marveled at the degree to which Wall Street is “shocked that President Donald Trump is destroying the robust economy he inherited.”\n\nWere any of these people watching the same campaign the rest of the country saw? Trump’s self-sabotaging agenda was not subtext; it was explicit text, often delivered in all caps. He devoted much more time in his rally speeches to trade wars and fantasies of retaliation against personal enemies than to corporate tax breaks. And some commentators (ahem) tried to convey that even if those precious tax cuts passed, there’s a lot more to capitalism than low taxes.\n\nThe column was published two weeks before the White House rolled out its radical tariffs agenda, sending global markets into a tailspin.\n\nRampell added, “C-suite executives and market analysts have no excuses for getting Trump’s economic agenda wrong. They are paid to make accurate predictions and to follow incremental regulatory and legislative developments. They were supposed to know that the ‘Tariff Man’ might raise tariffs, and that the guardrails were being dismantled. They went into this eyes-wide-open.”\n\nIf you spend enough time online, you’ll probably see references to the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party. I’ve seen this summary making the rounds, and it’s is as good as any: “Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party refers to a parody of regretful voters who vote for cruel and unjust policies (and politicians) and are then surprised when their own lives become worse as a result.”\n\nIt appears to have started in 2015 with someone who wrote, “‘I never thought leopards would eat MY face,’ sobs woman who voted for the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party.”\n\nThe more Trump’s Wall Street backers recoil in reaction to the agenda they helped advance, the more the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party comes to mind.",

    "title": "AG Pam Bondi moves the goalposts on the nation’s ‘constitutional crisis’",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "As Donald Trump’s second term got underway, and his administration expressed indifference to legal limits, even going so far as to suggest the White House might disregard court rulings, there’s been ample discussion about whether the United States is facing a constitutional crisis. As it turns out, the president and his team are eager to join this public conversation, though they have some unusual thoughts on the matter.\n\nIn mid-February, for example, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that “the real constitutional crisis is taking place within our judicial branch,” because several judges had issued rulings the president did not like. While different political scientists define “constitutional crisis” in different ways, Leavitt’s assessment was, by any fair measure, ridiculous.\n\nBut another one of Trump’s prominent spokespersons, who ostensibly leads the Justice Department, took this absurdity one step further over the weekend. Politico reported:\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi on Sunday pushed back on the idea that President Donald Trump might ignore future rulings decided by the Supreme Court, spurring constitutional discord. The real crisis, she argued, is the barrage of lawsuits the White House faces as it tries to move quickly on its agenda.\n\n“Just since January 20th, we’ve had over 170 lawsuits filed against us. That should be the constitutional crisis right there, 50 injunctions,” Bondi said on “Fox News Sunday.” (For those keeping score, this was the attorney general’s 13th appearance on Fox since being sworn in nine weeks ago. She’s still averaging roughly one Fox appearance every four days.)\n\nTo be sure, the Republican lawyer makes weird political arguments all the time, but this was more outrageous than most. The White House’s Leavitt argued that it’s a “constitutional crisis” for judges to issue opinions that Trump disagrees with, but the nation’s chief law enforcement official’s claim was just as outlandish, if not more so: Bondi argued that for Americans to take their legal concerns to the courts is itself a “constitutional crisis.”\n\nIt reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how the American system works. In this country, if you believe the government is abusing its legal authority, you have the right to file a lawsuit and bring your concerns to a judge, who is expected to adjudicate the matter fairly and rule on the legal merits.\n\nTo hear the attorney general tell it, however, if Americans exercise their legal rights by filing such lawsuits, they’re necessarily creating a “crisis.”\n\nAs for how the administration might deal with such a crisis, Bondi didn’t say.\n\nDuring the same on-air appearance, the Fox host asked whether there might be a future scenario in which Trump defies a court order. The attorney general replied, “The president is going to comply with the law. He was overwhelmingly elected by an overwhelming majority of the United States citizens to be our commander-in-chief.”\n\nFirst, she could’ve said, “Of course the president will comply with court orders,” but Bondi instead answered a question that wasn’t asked. Second, suggesting that Trump will comply with the White House’s interpretation of the law was hardly reassuring. Third, Trump won with less than 50% of the popular vote, which isn’t even close to being “an overwhelming majority.”\n\nBut stepping back, it’s also worth appreciating the degree to which the line between the attorney general and the White House press office has grown awfully blurry of late. Those who at least pretended to be concerned about the politicization of federal law enforcement in recent years should probably take note.",

    "title": "The 3 words that Putin apologists use to blame the West for Russian aggression",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "This is the first in a five-part MSNBC Daily series, \"The Future of NATO.\" With the Trump administration attacking allies, removing troops from European training missions, handing Ukraine’s bargaining chips to Russia and refusing to guarantee European security even as “backstop” — we’re asking five crucial questions about the future of NATO, the U.S. and Europe.\n\nAt a time when NATO faces perhaps its greatest challenge, the question of its so-called “expansion” at the end of the Cold War remains very much alive. The two matters are, in fact, closely entwined. NATO’s enemies — both in Russia and now, sadly, in and around the White House — continue to deploy spurious arguments to weaken the alliance and justify Vladimir Putin’s brazen war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe flawed argument about NATO expansion flows from two false premises. One is that in February 1990, when then-U.S. Secretary of State James Baker uttered the words “not one inch eastward,” he allegedly “promised” Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that the American-led defense alliance would not enlarge.\n\nThe flawed argument about NATO expansion flows from two false premises.\n\nMany of those who have latched on to this phrase are oblivious to the context. Baker and Gorbachev were discussing German reunification, not central and Eastern European security. At the time, Baker made no hard and fast promises, for these were exploratory talks to test ideas, and both sides vowed to speak more in the future. Nor, as secretary of state, was Baker in a position to promise anything. The president needed to sign off on any pledge.\n\nCrucially, President George H.W. Bush never used the “not one inch” phrase. Instead, he spoke about the “special status” of East German territory, which would have to be negotiated (for this was seven months before the details were enshrined in the “Two Plus Four” treaty settling the German question).\n\nWhile the diplomatic reality of 1990 was complicated, the unscrupulous political use of these discussions has been quite simple. Putin has repeatedly deployed the false notion of the West’s “broken promises” in his propaganda campaign as he seeks to reclaim the Soviet sphere of influence lost at the end of the Cold War. For him, the “not one inch” phrase is a useful tool as he seeks to push NATO back to its 1997 borders while justifying his military actions and own revanchism and revisionism.\n\nUnfortunately, Putin has also found useful idiots in the West, willing to aid and abet his nefarious campaign.\n\nThe second flawed premise about the 1990s is based on the belief that America was in some way the aggressor — that Washington used NATO to expand America’s own influence while looking to humiliate and directly threaten the Russian Federation in the process.\n\nWhat this argument totally ignores is the agency of European states. After 1991, those in central and Eastern Europe especially benefited from NATO’s “open door” policy, effectively in existence since 1949, for it is based on Article 10 of the founding treaty.\n\nUnfortunately, Putin has also found useful idiots in the West, willing to aid and abet his nefarious campaign.\n\nWhat’s more, according to the principles of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, as sovereign states these European countries also have the right to freely choose whether to join any alliance — a right that Moscow acknowledged when it signed the act. The ex-Soviet satellite states and the Baltic states utilized these opportunities, in large part, because they had never wanted to be part of Stalin’s “empire by imposition” symbolized by the Warsaw Pact. They also feared that as soon as Russia recovered from its economic collapse and postcolonial trauma, it would expand again.\n\nThese concerns were met by significant skepticism. In the 1990s, Washington (and other capitals) were still gripped by hopes for a “commonwealth of nations” and a “better” post-Berlin Wall world.\n\nYet ultimately, Russia’s democracy was stillborn. Already under President Boris Yeltsin, ultranationalism, authoritarianism and talk of the “near abroad” and “russkii mir” raised the specter of Russian neo-imperialism. After Putin arrived at the Kremlin, Russian ambitions — and Eastern European fears — eventually came true.\n\nWhen Putin sent his troops into Ukraine in 2022, his goal was to wipe the country from the map. In response, Finland and Sweden quickly applied to join the NATO club, abandoning their traditional commitment to neutrality or military nonalignment in the process. By 2024, they too had entered the alliance through its open door.\n\nIn short, then, NATO “expansion” has been driven not so much by Washington’s imperial impulse. Rather, it has been a reaction to a shared European perception that Moscow remains a clear and present danger to its security.\n\nThis remains the situation today. Despite headlines that fluctuate by the hour, two fundamental developments are clear.\n\nWhen Putin sent his troops into Ukraine in 2022, his goal was to wipe the country from the map.\n\nOn the one hand, Putin does not tolerate the concept of “sovereign equality” of states. It is one of the fundamental principles of the liberal international order that he has declared obsolete. Putin (like China’s President Xi Jinping and, apparently, America’s President Donald Trump) believes in only strong states — Russia, China, the U.S. — being “truly sovereign.” Small states have no status. That is a main reason why he is so keen to talk bilaterally with Trump, ignoring Ukraine (and America’s European allies). Putin’s maxim is clear. Those not at the table are on the menu — and can potentially be eaten alive.\n\nOn the other, the erratic Trump has eroded — and perhaps even already destroyed — Europe’s faith in America’s reliability. Nor does America seem prepared to pursue a Rooseveltian view of Western security. In this view, which has largely held sway in Washington since the 1940s, cooperation and interdependence with Europe are in the U.S. national interest. The trans-Atlantic alliance is more than just an operative defense club under the American nuclear umbrella, but an organization based on genuine friendship. And both America and Europe share a common belief in order, stability, the rule of law and democracy.\n\nAll these key pillars of the cohesive postwar West were intended to secure long-term peace and prosperity. With their rapid crumbling, France’s Emmanuel Macron, the U.K.’s Keir Starmer and Germany’s Friedrich Merz — together with the rest of Europe — are not only heavily investing in their own defense and deterrence capabilities. They are also insisting on the vital relevance of this rules-based order.\n\nIndeed, Europe is fortunately rising to the challenge. Its leaders would prefer America to be an active and reliable partner. The invitation these countries extended in the late 1940s for Washington to lead a consensual empire still exists. Yet the leaders of these countries remain doubtful about America’s desire to stay at the party. While hoping for the best, they are therefore preparing for the worst. Which is a world where a distant, volatile and bullying America is no longer dependable, while a looming, brutalized and calculating Russia poses an ever-greater threat, not only symbolized by its direct military aggression in Ukraine, but also through its conduct of nonlinear and distinctly political warfare.\n\nRussian hybrid warfare is already an established fact. And the Kremlin’s continuous and erroneous claims of NATO’s wrongful expansion is merely one key prong in this political conflict. Besides the destruction of Ukraine, what Putin wants is to drive the Euro-Atlantic community apart — and to see it wrecked. Europeans are determined not to let this happen. What America really wants remains to be seen.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "On Wednesday afternoon, shortly after stock market trading had wrapped up for the day, Donald Trump kicked off a trade war with sweeping international trade tariffs. On Thursday, Wall Street followed international markets off a cliff.\n\nIt was at that point that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, in apparent seriousness, that the two developments might’ve been unrelated.\n\n“For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president’s economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,” Bessent told far-right media personality Tucker Carlson, in an interview that was released on Friday.\n\nTwo days later, as NBC News reported, the Cabinet secretary kept talking, though he hardly made matters any better.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” Bessent called it a “false narrative” that people who are close to retiring may be reluctant after their retirement savings may have dropped last week because of the stock market downturn. “I think that’s a false narrative,” he told moderator Kristen Welker. “Americans who want to retire right now, the Americans who put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don’t look at the day-to-day fluctuations.”\n\nPerhaps Bessent should have conversations with a wider range of people — because there were countless Americans looking at the “day-to-day fluctuations” in their retirement accounts last week.\n\nIn the same interview, the treasury secretary — ostensibly one of the most powerful and influential figures on the planet when it comes to the economy and financial markets — told host Kristen Welker, “[W]hat I’ve been very impressed with is the market infrastructure, that we had record volume on Friday and everything is working very smoothly. So, the American people, they can be very, take great comfort in that.”\n\nWhy would Americans take “great comfort” in the fact that trillions of dollars of wealth disappeared “very smoothly”? I’m not sure, though Bessent delivered the line as if he believed it made sense. It did not.\n\nStepping back, it’s worth emphasizing that Bessent was hardly seen as a controversial Cabinet choice for Trump. On the contrary, he was seen as one of the president’s most mainstream personnel choices for his second term, and the Treasury secretary was confirmed with more Democratic votes than most of his fellow secretaries.\n\nUpon his confirmation, many hoped that Bessent would be a voice of reason in the Trump administration. On a team filled with cranks and charlatans, Bessent might be in a position to steer the president in responsible directions, serving as the proverbial “adult in the room.”\n\nBut those hopes have been dashed. As The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell recently summarized in a column focused on the treasury secretary, “The ‘adults in the room’ sometimes failed in Trump’s first term. Now, they’re not even pretending to try.”\n\nMSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle told viewers, “My sources say that Scott Bessent is kind of the odd man out here and, in the inner circle that Trump has, he’s not even close to Scott Bessent or listening to him. Some have said to me, he’s looking for an exit door to try to get himself to the Fed, because in the last few days he’s really hurting his own credibility and history in the markets.”\n\nOf course, if Bessent is worried about salvaging his credibility, he might already be too late.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the April 6 episode of “Inside with Jen Psaki.”\n\nLast week, Donald Trump showed us, once again, just how much damage his administration and its misguided policies could inflict on the American people. But there’s also a hopeful lesson we can take from the last few days: People are fighting back. I’d even venture to say that last week was the best political week Democrats, and anyone else horrified by the Trump administration, have had since Election Day.\n\nAcross the country, it’s the people who are driving this huge energy shift. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of Americans poured into the streets in communities big and small to protest against Trump. While cities like New York and Washington, D.C., saw tens of thousands, and big crowds showed up in red areas, too.\n\nI’m not saying this is enough or that it will stop all the damage. Republicans still run both the Senate and the House, after all. But these are all steps in the right direction.\n\nThe American people are also making themselves heard at the ballot box. On Tuesday, the people of Wisconsin delivered a complete rebuke to Elon Musk as he attempted to buy a state Supreme Court seat. The world’s richest man went so far as to travel there to campaign with oversized checks and cheesehead hats. Voters responded by electing a liberal judge by a double-digit margin over the MAGA favorite. In Florida, the outpouring of anti-Trump and anti-Musk energy shaved roughly 15 to 20 points off Republicans’ November margins in two special elections for Congress. These are all good signs.\n\nPeople are also responding by throwing their hat in the ring to run for higher office. Former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra launched a bid for California governor; Garlin Gilchrist, Michigan’s lieutenant governor, entered the gubernatorial race; and Mallory McMorrow, a Michigan state senator, jumped into a race for an open U.S. Senate seat.\n\nDemocrats in Washington are also showing some signs of life. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey held the Senate floor for 25 hours and 5 minutes, breaking the record of segregationist Strom Thurmond and reminding Americans that someone is standing up for them.\n\nClearly a lot of people were hungry for somebody in Washington to take that kind of action. On Booker’s TikTok account alone, the livestream of his speech got over 350 million likes and 110,000 people watched the senator finish his remarks on his YouTube page. In the end, Booker’s speech sparked more attention and coverage than anything else Democrats in Washington have tried since Trump took office.\n\nOther Senate Democrats joined the fight, too. Sen. Adam Schiff of California placed a hold on the nomination of Ed Martin to be the top prosecutor in Washington, D.C. Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona pledged to do the same to block Trump’s nominees for top leaders at the Department of Veterans Affairs, in protest of the president’s plans to slash jobs and jeopardize benefits at the agency. Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington spearheaded a bipartisan push to have Congress take away Trump’s power to implement tariffs. And Senate Democrats convinced a handful of Republicans to join them in voting to suspend tariffs on Canada.\n\nI’m not saying this is enough or that it will stop all the damage. Republicans still run both the Senate and the House, after all. But these are all steps in the right direction.\n\nLast week showed that the Democratic Party still has a lot of life in it.\n\nAlso last week, some of the biggest names in Democratic politics stepped back into the fray. Former President Barack Obama spoke to a crowd at Hamilton College in upstate New York on Thursday, calling out just how outrageous the last few months have been. “Imagine if I had done any of this,” Obama told the crowd. “It’s unimaginable that the same parties that are silent now would have tolerated behavior like that from me, or a whole bunch of my predecessors.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris made a rare public appearance, also calling out organizations that aren’t meeting the moment: “There is a sense of fear that is taking hold in our country, and I understand it, but we’re seeing people stay quiet. We are seeing organizations stay quiet. We are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats.”\n\nLast week showed that the Democratic Party still has a lot of life in it. So, while there are plenty of reasons to fear the actions of the Trump administration, it’s important to note that people are standing up to it. People are making their elected officials listen. There is a lot of work ahead, but these are all steps in the right direction.\n\nAs Booker wrote on social media after his marathon speech, “After getting some rest, I am in awe of everyone who continues to lift their voice and speak out. This is a moment for our country, and we must make a choice about the America we want to be.”",

    "title": "5 good signs for Democrats: Cory Booker, Wisconsin, Hand's Off",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Time to get off the mat\n\nDemocrats are starting to shake off the fog of the 2024 election. Collectively, tens of thousands of people have attended recent rallies, and many others have crowded town hall meetings to express their frustration with current lawmakers.\n\nBut this week may have offered the best signs yet. Here are five reasons it felt like a turning point for Democrats.\n\n1. Booker’s history-making speech\n\nSen. Cory Booker’s 25-hour Senate floor speech didn’t just break Sen. Strom Thurmond’s decades-old record — it was a rallying cry for Democrats desperate for someone to stand up and fight. And people paid attention: Booker’s TikTok livestream received over 350 million likes and his office fielded over 28,000 calls.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Booker sent a clear message to his colleagues: Democrats can’t afford to coast. If officials want to hold on to their seats, they need to think creatively and do everything in their power to fight Trump’s agenda — or step aside for someone who will.\n\n2. Wisconsin and Florida voters sent a message\n\nWith Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court win and improvements in Florida’s special House elections, Democrats sent Trump a warning he can’t ignore.\n\nProgressive Judge Susan Crawford won her Supreme Court seat by double digits, despite Elon Musk pouring millions into the race. This suggests his money might be helping Democrats more than it’s helping Republicans.\n\nThe fallout from Wisconsin also suggests Trump is realizing Musk is a liability. It’s no coincidence that a few days after Crawford’s win, Trump told reporters that Musk would likely be wrapping up his current role in “a few months.”\n\n3. Young candidates across the country are stepping up\n\nIf 2024 was a gut punch for progressives, 2025 is looking like a generational wake-up call. And young Democrats are answering.\n\nFrom Kat Abughazaleh in Illinois to Deja Foxx in Arizona and Christian Menefee in Texas, a wave of smart, unflinching young candidates are stepping up.\n\nMeanwhile Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow — who became a viral sensation for her floor speech condemning a colleague who accused her of “grooming children” for promoting LGBTQ values — and New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas have both announced bids for Senate seats.\n\nThese are candidates who know voters are hungry for fighters, and if elected, would redefine which voices are front and center for Democrats.\n\n4. Democratic senators are flexing their power\n\nFreshman Sens. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Adam Schiff of California are showing what it looks like when Democrats fight fire with fire. Gallego is blocking Trump’s Veterans Affairs nominees in protest of sweeping job cuts at the VA — a bold move in a bipartisan committee. Schiff is putting a hold on Ed Martin’s nomination for U.S. attorney in D.C., citing Martin’s weaponization of the office.\n\nThis is what it looks like when Democrats stop playing nice and start playing to win.\n\n5. Today’s April 5 protests could be massive\n\nThe grassroots energy hasn’t faded. If anything, it’s growing.\n\nThe nationwide Hands Off! protests on April 5 are shaping up to be the largest single-day protest since Trump took office. Organizers have planned over 1,100 events across all 50 states — and more than 250,000 people have already RSVP’d.\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nNo, Democrats don’t have the White House. But they have something else right now: momentum. And a party that is waking up to the reality that business as usual is no longer acceptable.\n\nA race to watch: Texas’ 18th Congressional District\n\nIt’s been nearly a month since Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner, who represented Texas’ 18th Congressional District, passed away. But instead of calling a special election — something Gov. Greg Abbott has done swiftly in the past — he’s stalling. Why? Because he knows sending just one more Democrat to the House of Representatives could erode House Speaker Mike Johnson’s thin GOP majority. And Abbott apparently has no qualms leaving 800,000 Texans without representation.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries isn’t buying Abbott’s excuses, calling the delay a deliberate power play and warning that the governor should “lawyer up.” Christian Menefee, the chief civil lawyer for Harris County and a candidate for the seat, is also ready to take Abbott to court. His message: “Your silence is suppression.”\n\nAbbott could call an emergency election tomorrow, just like he did in 2018 and 2022 when vacancies benefited Republicans. But if he waits until November — or even later — Houston’s historically Black and Hispanic 18th District will be left voiceless for months.",

    "title": "Ovechkin is the hockey GOAT after breaking NHL goals record fair and square",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "It’s a debate as old as organized athletic competition itself. Who is the greatest of all time? Alex Ovechkin is now making his own GOAT case in professional hockey. With his 895th career goal on Sunday, the Washington Capitals star has accomplished what was once unthinkable and surpassed “The Great One,” Wayne Gretzky, as the all-time leading goal scorer in NHL history.\n\nWhen Gretzky hung up his skates after his 1998-99 season with the New York Rangers, nobody could have imagined his record being broken. Now, after watching Ovechkin’s historic season, I can’t help but wonder if this will be the last “unattainable” record to fall in my lifetime.\n\nWhen Gretzky hung up his skates after his 1998-99 season with the New York Rangers, nobody could have imagined his record being broken.\n\nIn baseball, it’s Barry Bonds’ 762 career home runs. For those denouncing PEDs, it’s Hank Aaron’s 755 home runs. In basketball, it’s LeBron James’ all-time career points total (which is increasing as we speak). In football, it’s Tom Brady's 649 career passing touchdowns and 89,214 passing yards.\n\nBut I think there’s something about Ovechkin’s record that puts it in a special category as far as individual records are considered.\n\nBonds’ steroid use will forever place an asterisk next to his statistics in record books. While Brady is widely considered the football GOAT, the NFL’s offensive-minded era of football has certainly helped. James is somehow still dominating games 20 years into a surefire spot on the Mount Rushmore of the game. But like Brady, I’d argue the league he plays in now is a physically softer one. If you simply breathe on a quarterback in the wrong way, you can draw a flag. Heck, the league made a rule banning lunging for a quarterback's legs while on the ground — a rule widely believed to be the result of Brady tearing his ACL in 2008.\n\nOvechkin, on the other hand, is playing in an era when goal-scoring is down compared with Gretzky’s generation. Goalies also had far smaller pads in the ’80s and ’90s than the goalies of today. Anecdotally, you can also argue the league has far more parity today than a few decades ago, with talent widely dispersed around the league. Gretzky played alongside a series of Hall of Famers for years, forcing opponents to split their focus. Ovechkin is generally the main target of defenses.\n\nNone of this is to say that Gretzky isn’t the greatest hockey player to ever lace up ice skates. His ability to distribute the puck shows in his insane career points total. And keep in mind that Gretzky still has more career assists than any other player has total points for his career. He’s more than 1,200 points clear of the second-best player. But if we’re just looking at goals scored, Ovechkin seems to have broken the record fair and square — including in the same number of games that it took Gretzky to set the benchmark.\n\nOvechkin is 39 years old. He has one year remaining on his current, and most likely final, contract in the league. That means he could realistically push his all-time total to around 950 goals. He’s already won a Stanley Cup for his championship-starved franchise. And even without another year, it’s likely his goal record may never be broken. In fact, if the Capitals win it all this year, I wouldn’t be surprised it Ovechkin retired at the end the season.\n\nFew athletes get to walk off the stage at the very pinnacle of their careers. A broken-down Peyton Manning won a Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos before retiring, David Robinson exited stage left after winning a title with the San Antonio Spurs in 2003, and Jerome Bettis ran off the field for the final time after a 2006 Super Bowl. What could be better than breaking the unbreakable record, winning a Stanley Cup and riding off into the sunset? For Ovechkin, it would be a final hat trick in a career filled with them.",

    "title": "Why Trump's tariff chart doesn't add up",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "When President Donald Trump presented his sweeping global tariffs from the Rose Garden on Wednesday, even the most basic questions were left up in the air. At the top of the list: How did the White House derive the wildly disparate rates listed on the graphic Trump so proudly displayed? As global markets roiled in the aftermath of the announcement, the White House gave an answer about its calculations that was patently ridiculous.\n\nAs global markets roiled in the aftermath of the announcement, the White House gave an answer about its calculations that was patently ridiculous.\n\nThe simple version is that the White House calculated the tariff rate for each country by putting our trade deficit with a country over the amount of goods we import from that country and dividing. Writer James Surowiecki was among the first to crack the code in a post on X. Here’s how he later explained it in an Inc. post:\n\nBy way of example, we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia, and import $28 billion in goods from them. $17.9 billion is 64 percent of $28 billion, and on Trump’s chart that became the “tariff rate” Indonesia supposedly charges us. We have a $66 billion trade deficit with South Korea, and we import $133 billion in goods from them. Sixty-six is 50.3 percent of 133, so South Korea’s “tariff rate” is listed as 50 percent. Similarly, our trade with the U.K. is close to balanced, so the U.K. was listed as having a tariff rate of just 10%.\n\nThe U.S. Office of the Trade Representative put out a document on Wednesday night trying to make the formula seem fancy by using Greek symbols but, in the process, confirmed Surowiecki’s hypothesis. (The best part is how in trying to pretend otherwise, the formula includes two variables whose values cancel each other out in the equation.) In doing so, it laid bare just how unnecessary these tariffs really are.\n\nTrump claimed in Wednesday’s announcement that the tariffs are “reciprocal” against nations that “looted, pillaged, raped and plundered” American industry. There was nothing resembling reciprocity in the rates provided, including 20% levy on items imported from the European Union and 97% on items imported from Cambodia. All other countries, including the United Kingdom, are to be subject to a flat 10% import tax.\n\nTrump holds up a chart at the White House on Wednesday. Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images\n\nWhile the president said that those rates equal half the duties on American exports to those countries, the math doesn’t check out. The executive order putting the new tariffs in place suggests that the difference could be explained away by the “non-tariff barriers” to trade that other countries impose on American goods. And that still didn’t fully jibe with the specific numbers plastered on Trump’s prop on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWhile politicians, especially Trump, have railed against trade deficits, there’s nothing inherently bad about them. All a trade deficit means is that one country imports more goods from another country than it exports to that other country. If the United States has a trade deficit with Costa Rica for bananas, it doesn’t mean that America is getting shorted.\n\nThis absurd formula's existence reflects a White House that started with a policy that Trump wants and worked backward to a justification for it.\n\nTrump appears to hold the nonsensical idea that there’ll be some great surge in American production based on these tariffs — when there are certain goods that will not and cannot be produced in the United States. For example, coffee and vanilla beans are going to be subject to massive price increases as importers bringing in product from Indonesia and Madagascar are forced to pay an extra 32% and 47%, respectively, for their products. (Does the president think we can grow those crops here?)\n\nI’m going to level with you, readers. I didn’t do great in my undergraduate economics classes. I understood the concepts but never applied myself, instead considering the field in general to be “political science gone wrong with math.” But even I can tell you that none of Trump’s tariffs policy makes any logical sense. There is a total disconnect between the tariffs and the problem that Trump says the tariffs will fix.\n\nAs Dean Baker, a senior economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, put it on Substack: “Suppose your doctor suddenly insisted that you needed to follow a strict diet and exercise regimen. He said he realized you had a serious problem when he divided your height by your birthday, and it came out way too high. You would probably decide that you need a new doctor.”\n\nThis absurd formula's existence reflects a White House that started with a policy that Trump wants and worked backward to a justification for it. We’ve spent months waiting to hear how the administration would administer the global tariff scheme, but the method for doing so was unclear until Wednesday’s news conference. Even more unsettling is that there’s no sign Trump plans to back off these beloved tariffs of his, no matter how much they hurt America’s economy. Math didn’t come into play when he put this tax hike into place. It’s unclear what math — a total wipeout in the midterm elections, maybe? — will force him to back off them.",

    "title": "Jefferson Griffin lost the North Carolina Supreme Court race and ought to admit it",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Judge Jefferson Griffin, a Republican who lost his November race for the North Carolina Supreme Court, has created a scene by refusing to concede the race for five months, and recently a 2001 photo has surfaced of him wearing a Confederate uniform at a fraternity party when he was a student at the University of North Carolina. Griffin insists that the photo “does not represent the person I am today.” If it’s true that he no longer supports the Lost Cause, a mythology that glorifies the Confederates that attacked the Union, then he should also give up the lost cause of election subversion.\n\nIf it’s true that he no longer supports the Lost Cause, then he should also give up the lost cause of election subversion.\n\nIncumbent Justice Allison Riggs, the Democrat in the race, won the election by 734 votes, but by challenging 65,000 ballots that were cast in November, Griffin continues to try to whittle down the electorate after the fact to tip the race in his favor. A Friday ruling by a three-judge panel on the Republican-controlled appeals court — on which Griffin, who recused himself, sits — ruled in Griffin’s favor. The panel decided 2-1 that the 65,000 voters whose eligibility Griffin challenges should have 15 business days to prove they were eligible to vote.\n\nBut the North Carolina Supreme Court intervened Monday with a stay against the appeals court ruling. We hope it's more than a temporary pause and that the Republican majority on the state's highest court agrees with the judge who dissented from Friday's appeals court ruling. That dissenting judge argued that Friday's ruling amounts to “changing the rules by which these lawful voters took part in our electoral process after the election to discard their otherwise valid votes,” and he rightly said that “an attempt to alter the outcome of only one race among many on the ballot is directly counter to law, equity, and the Constitution.”\n\nIf the appeals court ruling is allowed to stand, then some percentage of 65,000 North Carolina voters will have seen their vote erased.\n\nConfederates lost the Civil War, but as many historians of Reconstruction have noted, the South won the culture war. Consider that Griffin, then a college student, was proudly posing in Confederate grays 136 years after that side surrendered at Appomattox.\n\nWhile the particular myths of the Lost Cause have varied over the years, the motivation stays the same: Lies about the past are told to help people in power hold on to it in the present. Historic voter turnout in North Carolina in 2008 helped send Barack Obama to the White House, and since then the party that lost that race has been pushing the myth of “voter fraud.”\n\nWith the NC NAACP, a coalition of North Carolinians sued then-Gov. Pat McCrory to block the monster voter suppression law he signed in 2013. In federal court, we asked Republicans who claimed they were concerned about widespread voter fraud to produce evidence it existed. They could not then, and they cannot now. Voter fraud is the bogeyman they warn about to keep the Lost Cause alive today.\n\nI do not question Griffin’s sincerity when he says he regrets wearing a Confederate uniform nearly a quarter century ago. He may also regret the Confederate flag his fraternity used to fly at its “Old South” ball. They’re symbols of another era. But they are symbols of a story that says Black Americans having political equality hurts white people. This is the story of the Lost Cause. It’s a lie.\n\nGriffin lost. He may not like that result, but that doesn’t mean something nefarious happened.\n\nWhen all the votes legally cast in North Carolina were counted last November, Griffin lost. He may not like that result, but that doesn’t mean something nefarious happened. His ongoing challenge to North Carolinians’ choice has become its own lost cause, deeply rooted in the tradition of myths that have kept some people re-enacting the Civil War for 160 years. For a court to rule in support of this challenge is to establish a precedent as dangerous as the Plessy v. Ferguson decision that propped up Jim Crow for almost 60 years.\n\nIt’s past time to hang up (literally and figuratively) the Confederate uniform and give up the belief system that drives Lost Cause thinking. North Carolina does better when more people vote. Any politician who doesn’t acknowledge that can’t be trusted to represent the will of the voters. Any judge who doesn’t believe that cannot faithfully interpret our state or federal constitution. The moral foundations of “we the people” are at stake in this attempt at election subversion. Each of us has a responsibility to stand against the lies that have kept the Lost Cause alive this long.",

    "title": "Supreme Court splits 5-4 to grant Trump emergency relief in Alien Enemies Act deportation litigation",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "A divided Supreme Court vacated temporary restraining orders issued by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that had halted certain deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. The court split 5-4, with Republican appointees in the majority and Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett dissenting alongside the court's three Democratic appointees.\n\nThe majority framed the matter as a mere procedural disagreement, but dissenting justices cited loftier issues at play, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor highlighting potential “life or death consequences.”\n\nIn an unsigned \"per curiam\" ruling for the court, the majority said detainees must bring their challenges in habeas corpus proceedings and must do so where they are confined. “The detainees are confined in Texas, so venue is improper in the District of Columbia,” the majority said.\n\nThe majority also said detainees under the act “must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.” The majority emphasized that it wasn’t ruling on the government’s interpretation of the act itself.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union’s Lee Gelernt, who was counsel of record at the Supreme Court for the plaintiffs who brought the case, emphasized the due process aspect of the ruling. “The critical point of this ruling is that the Supreme Court said individuals must be given due process to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is an important victory,” he said.\n\nWriting a dissent joined by the two other Democratic appointees and partly by Barrett, Sotomayor called the majority’s legal conclusion “suspect.” She said the court granted the government “extraordinary relief” without mentioning “the grave harm Plaintiffs will face if they are erroneously removed to El Salvador or regard for the Government’s attempts to subvert the judicial process throughout this litigation.”\n\nThe majority chided the dissenters’ “rhetoric” and said it agrees the detainees are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal and that \"the only question is which court will resolve that challenge.\" Similarly, Justice Brett Kavanaugh (who was in the majority) added a concurring opinion to emphasize that “all nine Members of the Court agree that judicial review is available. The only question is where that judicial review should occur.”\n\nBut on the prospect of life-or-death stakes, Sotomayor wrote, “Individuals who are unable to secure counsel, or who cannot timely appeal an adverse judgment rendered by a habeas court, face the prospect of removal directly into the perilous conditions of El Salvador’s CECOT, where detainees suffer egregious human rights abuses.” She raised the concern of people being mistakenly deported and then the government not trying to get them back, which is at issue in another case pending before the justices.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson added her own dissent to lament the majority’s actions in the case, in which, as she put it, President Donald Trump “has invoked a centuries-old wartime statute to whisk people away to a notoriously brutal, foreign-run prison. For lovers of liberty, this should be quite concerning.”\n\nThe Trump administration sought high court intervention in litigation over the 1798 law, which Trump invoked to summarily deport alleged Venezuelan gang members on flights to El Salvador. The law has been invoked just three previous times in the nation’s history, all during declared wars.\n\nOn March 15, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued temporary restraining orders to halt certain deportations under the act pending further litigation. A divided federal appellate panel in Washington, D.C., declined to halt Boasberg’s orders, and the government appealed to the justices.\n\n“This case presents fundamental questions about who decides how to conduct sensitive national-security-related operations in this country — the President, through Article II, or the Judiciary, through TROs,” the administration wrote, referring to temporary restraining orders. “The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the President. The republic cannot afford a different choice,” it said in the March 28 application to Chief Justice John Roberts, who handles emergency litigation from Washington, D.C.\n\nOpposing the government’s application, the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit argued that the administration isn’t entitled to emergency relief.\n\nOpposing the government’s application, the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit argued that the administration isn’t entitled to emergency relief. They noted that the government can still remove people under other legal authorities besides the Alien Enemies Act. And they said that without Boasberg’s temporary orders in place, the plaintiffs “will suffer extraordinary and irreparable harms — being sent out of the United States to a notorious Salvadoran prison, where they will remain incommunicado, potentially for the rest of their lives, without having had any opportunity to contest their designation as gang members.”\n\nBoasberg has separately been examining whether Trump officials violated his orders. The government has questioned the Obama-appointed judge’s authority and has maintained that it technically didn’t violate his orders in any event. But the plaintiffs said officials clearly violated his orders when they didn’t even attempt to return individuals on planes, despite Boasberg’s unambiguous directive to do so and having the ability to do so. The judge is poised to rule on the matter in the coming days after a hearing last week at which he had a hard time getting answers from the government about its compliance with his orders.\n\nThe government’s citation of national security concerns comes amid the “Signalgate” scandal, in which top officials mistakenly disclosed sensitive military information, as well as the government’s admission in another case that it made an “administrative error” in removing an individual to a Salvadoran prison who wasn’t supposed to be sent there, which Sotomayor cited in her dissent.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Donald Trump, self-proclaimed “protector” of women, issued a proclamation Thursday acknowledging Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, in which he leveled a bigoted attack against undocumented migrants.\n\nThe announcement began:\n\nThis month, we recognize National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month by ending the unfathomable human abuse committed under open borders policies. One of the leading causes of sexual violence over the last 4 years has been the invasion of illegal aliens at our southern border. In a treasonous act of betrayal against the American people, the previous administration unleashed an army of gangs and criminal aliens from the darkest and most dangerous corners of the world — causing a dramatic increase of sexual violence in our neighborhoods and communities. These reckless policies empowered some of the most depraved people on the planet to exploit women and children in the most vicious ways imaginable.\n\nThe rest of the screed offered more of the same.\n\nLiterally the only true statement in that quoted section is that April is in fact Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. There has not been an “invasion” of immigrants through our southern border. And despite Trump’s efforts to convince the public otherwise, studies have repeatedly shown immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the U.S.\n\nIt’s perhaps not surprising that the president is less interested in bringing awareness to sexual assaults perpetrated by American citizens. Trump himself (as you likely know) was found liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in a civil trial in 2023. He famously boasted about groping women without their consent.\n\nTrump was once an associate of Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender (but he has never been implicated in any allegations). To serve as labor secretary in his first administration, Trump named Alex Acosta, the former U.S. attorney who oversaw a controversial plea deal for Epstein in a child sex abuse case. Trump also publicly sent well-wishes to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s co-defendant in his child sex trafficking case, as she fought the charges in 2020.\n\nThree of the men Trump selected for Cabinet positions this year previously faced accusations of sexual assault (two denied any wrongdoing; the third apologized to the woman via text message). Multiple Jan. 6 insurrectionists he pardoned had prior convictions for sexual assault. And some of the insurrectionists he pardoned have since been charged with sexual assault or soliciting a minor in connection with incidents alleged to have occurred before the insurrection. And, according to reporting from the Financial Times and The Times, Trump’s administration had a hand in helping accused sex trafficker Andrew Tate return to the U.S. after the administration allegedly pressured Romanian officials to loosen travel restrictions for Tate and his brother.\n\nSo Trump’s proclamation Thursday — ostensibly “to support survivors of sexual assault” — tracks with his and his administration’s overtly racist policies. At the same time, it refuses any “awareness” of his own history of sexual abuse or the sexual misconduct alleged against those in his inner circle.\n\nNo one needs Trump to proclaim anything in support of Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month — unless it’s an apology.",

    "title": "GOP senator says he was joking when he floated using violence against journalists",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "A Republican senator on Sunday said he was only joking when he suggested a day earlier that there would be less “fake news” if people were allowed to use violence against journalists.\n\nIn a video posted to X on Saturday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma recounted the story of William Taulbee, a former congressman from Kentucky who was shot and killed by Charles Kincaid, a news reporter, in 1890.\n\n“There’s a lot we can say about reporters of the stories they write, but I bet they would write a lot less false stories — as President Trump says, ‘fake news’ — if we could still handle our differences that way,” Mullin says in the nearly two-minute video.\n\nOn Feb. 28, 1890, Kincaid, a congressional reporter for The Louisville Courier-Journal and The Louisville Times, fatally shot Taulbee on the same U.S. Capitol staircase where Mullin stood in his video. The pair had a long-term feud arising from a report Kincaid published about Taulbee’s alleged extramarital affair. Kincaid was put on trial but acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.\n\nAfter The Oklahoman published a story about Mullin's video on Sunday, Mullin downplayed his remarks and insisted he was joking.\n\n“While you’re at it, don’t forget I also JOKED about bringing back caning to settle political disputes,” Mullin wrote in a post on X criticizing The Oklahoman. “Thanks for watching my videos.” Mullin also accused the outlet — the largest daily newspaper in the state — of being “out of touch” with Oklahomans.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Reporters Without Borders, Trump insulted, threatened or attacked members of the media more than 100 times from Sept. 1 to Oct. 24.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Mullin, a former MMA fighter, has made references to violence from the U.S. Capitol. In 2023, the senator almost got into a physical altercation with the president of the Teamsters union, Sean O’Brien, during a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. After sharing a series of critical social media posts O’Brien made about Mullin in the past, the congressman told the Teamsters president to “stand your butt up” so they could settle their differences in the room.\n\n“This is the time, this is the place,” Mullin said. “If you want to run your mouth, we can be two consenting adults. We can finish it here.” Mullin eventually sat down, and the hearing continued without a physical fight.\n\nMullin is a loyal supporter of President Donald Trump, who has espoused violent rhetoric about journalists. Just days before the 2024 presidential election, Trump said he wouldn’t mind if members of the press were killed. (His spokesperson later told ABC News that the president had been joking.)\n\nBut those November comments were not an isolated incident. According to an analysis by Reporters Without Borders, Trump insulted, threatened or attacked members of the media more than 100 times in the run-up to the election.\n\nSince retaking the White House, Trump has continued his attacks on the press. His administration has blocked reporters from covering news events at the White House, ousted some outlets from their working spaces inside the Pentagon, and called for investigations into public media companies.",

    "title": "The 'Hands off!' protests against Trump show the left is finding its voice",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "The day after President Donald Trump was sworn into office for his first term, he was met with the largest single-day protest in American history. But the second time around, the protests surrounding Trump’s inauguration were comparably muted — they were a fraction of the size, and generated far less impact than the first round. The disparity seemed to capture the demoralized, depleted mood among Americans who opposed Trump and stared slack-jawed as he won the popular vote upon his third attempt at the White House.\n\nYet on Saturday, mass protests swept the nation, and it could mean that dissenting Americans are finding their voices again. At a time when Trump is moving aggressively to crack down on intellectual and political dissent at universities, last weekend’s protests represented a massive rebuke of the Trump administration — and suggested the left is regaining its footing, as it figures out how to fight back.\n\nRegistering dissent is an important democratic exercise.\n\nSaturday’s “Hands Off!” rallies were backed by a large coalition of organizations that included civil rights groups, labor unions, climate groups, progressive activist outfits and left-wing groups like the Democratic Socialists of America. The organizers put forth three demands: “an end to the billionaire takeover and rampant corruption of the Trump administration”; “an end to slashing federal funds for Medicaid, Social Security, and other programs working people rely on”; and “an end to the attacks on immigrants, trans people, and other communities.”\n\nThe turnout was big: Over 1,000 “Hands Off” protests were planned across all 50 states, and organizers said turnout far exceeded the turnout of 500,000 RSVPs. There aren’t any independent estimates of national turnout, but dense, large crowds made their presence known in many cities. Per The New York Times:\n\nOn Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the protest stretched for nearly 20 blocks. In Chicago, thousands flooded Daley Plaza and adjacent streets, while, in the nation’s capital, tens of thousands surrounded the Washington Monument. In Atlanta, the police estimated the crowd marching to the gold-domed statehouse at over 20,000.\n\nIn addition to the crowds of thousands — or tens of thousands — who showed up in cities and towns across the nation, protests also took place abroad in cities including London, Paris and Berlin.\n\nLike all mass protests, the messages conveyed at these ones were diverse and sprawled beyond the overarching themes of the organizers. Protest signs expressed concern about free speech at a time when Trump is trying to quash it by bullying universities and attempting to deport legal immigrants who express pro-Palestinian speech. There were objections to Trump’s global economy-destabilizing tariff regime. In Washington, D.C., a rally for Gaza, in which protesters marched to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters, took place adjacent to the main “Hands Off” rally. And a lot of signs framed Trump and billionaire Elon Musk as posing a fascist threat to the country.\n\nPeople gather for the \"Hands Off!\" protest against the policies of President Donald Trump and his adviser, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, outside the Michigan Capitol in Lansing, Mich., on April 5. Jeff Kowlasky / AFP / Getty Images\n\nThe broad scope of the protests mirrors the broad scope of Trump’s assault on our republic — and underscores how big of a tent the anti-Trump coalition is going to need to be to effectively resist Trump’s dismantling of the administrative state, social services and democratic institutions.\n\nTo be sure, though it’s been on a smaller scale and less noticed, there actually has been a lot of protest activity in the first few months of Trump’s second administration. Indivisible, a liberal grassroots network, was effective in encouraging outraged citizens to go to town halls to make noise and hold Republicans accountable — so much so that the National Republican Congressional Committee advised GOP lawmakers to stop attending town halls rather than face their constituents’ wrath. Musk’s Tesla has been the object of boycotts and protests that appear to be hurting its bottom line. Anti-DOGE protests have taken place across the country for months. And while the Democratic Party leadership has largely shown itself to be feckless and is increasingly losing the trust of its members, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has been drawing huge crowds in swing states across the U.S. with his “Fighting Oligarchy” Tour.\n\nDemonstrators gather outside the Minnesota State Capitol during the nationwide \"Hands Off!\" protest, in St. Paul, Minn., on April 5. Kerem Yucel / AFP / Getty Images\n\nIt can be easy to overestimate the significance of a single protest, even a huge one. One-off protests can be forgotten rather quickly in an era where the news cycle moves at an unfathomable speed. And it’s relatively easy to get people to object to something; it’s far harder to get them to organize around a widely desired alternative.\n\nStill, registering dissent is an important democratic exercise, and reports of older first-time protesters coming out to say “no” to Trump are positive signs. As the republic teeters on the edge of myriad crises, the left is exhausted and afraid. But on Saturday it reminded us it’s still here, and it’s not going to go quietly into the night.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Florida police recently arrested a transgender woman for using the women’s restroom in the state Capitol in Tallahassee, in what is believed to be the first such arrest in a state with an anti-trans bathroom ban.\n\nMarcy Rheintgen, a 20-year-old college student and Illinois resident, was arrested March 19 on a trespassing charge after she used a women’s restroom in a protest against Florida’s law barring people from using bathrooms that don’t align with their assigned sex at birth in government-owned or -leased buildings.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Rheintgen had sent letters to every Florida state lawmaker to inform them that she planned to use a restroom at the statehouse that corresponded with her gender identity. She included a photo of herself for identification, the Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\n“I know that you know in your heart that this law is wrong and unjust. I know that you know in your heart that transgender people are human too, and that you can’t arrest us away,” she wrote. “I know that you know that I have dignity. That’s why I know that you won’t arrest me.”\n\nJon Davidson, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told the AP that Rheintgen’s arrest is the first of its kind that ACLU’s attorneys are aware of in any state with a bathroom ban.\n\nRheintgen, who the AP reported had been visiting her grandparents, was freed on pretrial release the day after her arrest, according to the Miami Herald. If convicted on the misdemeanor trespassing charge, she could face up to 60 days in jail.\n\nRheintgen told the AP that she wanted to show “the absurdity of this law in practice.”\n\n“If I’m a criminal, it’s going to be so hard for me to live a normal life, all because I washed my hands,” she said, adding that she was “horrified and scared” over what might happen next.\n\nNadine Smith, the executive director of Equality Florida, an LGBTQ civil rights organization, said in a statement that Rheintgen’s arrest was not about safety, but “about cruelty, humiliation, and the deliberate erosion of human dignity.”\n\n“Transgender people have been using restrooms aligned with their gender for generations without incident,” Smith wrote. “What’s changed is not their presence — it’s a wave of laws designed to intimidate them out of public life.”\n\nFlorida is one of more than a dozen states with a bathroom ban, though Utah is the only other state to criminalize the act. In recent years, GOP lawmakers across the country have passed legislation to crack down on trans rights and strip protections — a pattern that the Trump administration has mirrored on the federal level as well.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "The New York Times reported Thursday that the European Union may soon levy penalties against Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, under an E.U. law aimed at curbing disinformation, hate speech and other harmful content.\n\nIn July, the E.U. released preliminary findings of an investigation that found X had violated the Digital Services Act. Specifically, the E.U. concluded that:\n\nX’s interface for so-called verified accounts was not in line with industry practice and had been abused by “malicious actors” to deceive users.\n\nX has created barriers that hinder transparency about advertisements, thwarting “required supervision and research into emerging risks brought about by the distribution of advertising online.”\n\nX doesn’t comply with the Digital Services Act’s rules around providing public data to researchers who can use it to study the spread of things like disinformation.\n\nThe New York Times, citing four people with knowledge of the E.U.’s plans who declined to be identified because of the ongoing investigation, reported that penalties are expected to be announced this summer. The report has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News.\n\nThese days, X is a political weapon more than anything else. And Europe is right to want to regulate it.\n\nEarlier this year, Musk seemed to demonstrate how necessary the E.U.’s precautions are when he used X to spread disinformation in hopes of swaying voters toward the far-right, Nazi-friendly Alternative for Deutschland party, or AfD, in Germany’s snap elections. The platform also has apparently quashed dissent against Turkey’s illiberal regime and promoted disinformation in support of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who stands accused of attempting a coup — to say nothing of the ways it’s been used to spread disinformation in the U.S.\n\nThese days, X is a political weapon more than anything else. And Europe is right to want to regulate it.\n\nPredictably, the E.U.’s efforts to deter disinformation and hate speech have angered President Donald Trump and members of his administration, both of which are widely known to promote disinformation and hateful rhetoric online. The White House recently released a memo attacking the Digital Services Act, claiming it unfairly targets American companies and vowing that such regulations “will face scrutiny from the Administration.”\n\nOn Thursday, X’s Global Government Affairs team posted a statement saying that the platform “has gone above and beyond to comply with the EU’s Digital Services Act, and we will use every option at our disposal to defend our business, keep our users safe, and protect freedom of speech in Europe.”\n\nThat seems utterly detached from the clear dangers that Musk’s platform has posed to democracy and, frankly, public safety. But when you’re accustomed to operating free from oversight, accountability can feel like oppression.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "UPDATE (April 7, 2025, 4:02 p.m. ET): Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday halted a lower court order that would’ve required the Trump administration to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States from El Salvador by midnight. Litigation will continue in the case, with further possible rulings to come in the future from Roberts or the full court in the matter.\n\nThe Trump administration once again turns to the Supreme Court for emergency relief. This time, it’s ahead of a midnight deadline to return a man to the U.S. who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.\n\nThe federal government admits what it called an “administrative error” in sending Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. But it told the high court Monday that having done so “does not license district courts to seize control over foreign relations, treat the Executive Branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight.”\n\nThe federal government admits what it called an “administrative error” in sending Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.\n\nThe district court in this case is a Maryland federal judge, Obama appointee Paula Xinis, who issued the order and deadline that the administration wants the justices to upend. In the pending high court application, the recently confirmed solicitor general, John Sauer, called her action “unprecedented” in “dictating to the United States that it must not only negotiate with a foreign country to return an enemy alien on foreign soil, but also succeed by 11:59 p.m. tonight.”\n\nThe president nominated Sauer to the prestigious post — representing the federal government at the Supreme Court — after the lawyer represented Donald Trump in the appeal in which a divided high court granted Trump broad criminal immunity last year as he ran for office again.\n\nThe administration failed to get a Richmond, Virginia-based federal appeals court to halt Xinis’ order. In separate opinions explaining their views Monday, judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the government “has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process”; that the government’s contrary arguments are “unconscionable”; and that there’s “no question that the government screwed up here.”\n\nGuards lead a man Jennifer Vasquez Sura identified as her husband, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, through the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador. U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland via AP\n\nJustifying her order in an opinion over the weekend, Xinis wrote that the government acknowledged it “had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador — let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nAs to the government’s claim that he’s an MS-13 gang member, she wrote: “The ‘evidence’ against Abrego Garcia consisted of nothing more than his Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie, and a vague, uncorroborated allegation from a confidential informant claiming he belonged to MS-13’s ‘Western’ clique in New York — a place he has never lived.”\n\nMonday’s application is one of several emergency motions pending before the justices in which the administration wants relief from adverse rulings from lower courts. In resolving one of those motions on Friday, related to the canceling of education-related grants, the court sided with the administration in a contentious 5-4 decision.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

So, if respondents ultimately prevail, they can recover any wrongfully withheld funds through suit in an appropriate forum.”\n\nBut in one of the dissents, Justice Elena Kagan called the majority’s decision a “mistake.” She wrote that the federal government didn’t even defend the legality of canceling the grants at issue. “And contra the per curiam [majority opinion], the respondent States have consistently represented that the loss of these grants will force them — indeed, has already forced them — to curtail teacher training programs,” she wrote.\n\nIn another dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the majority’s “eagerness to insert itself into this early stage of ongoing litigation over the lawfulness of the Department’s actions — even when doing so facilitates the infliction of significant harms on the Plaintiff States, and even though the Government has not bothered to press any argument that the Department’s harm‐causing conduct is lawful — is equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate. It is also entirely unwarranted.”\n\nJoined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Jackson noted that the high court doesn’t “ordinarily exercise jurisdiction over TROs [temporary restraining orders], and this one is no different.” She added that the federal government hasn’t “articulated any concrete harm it will suffer if the grant terminations are not implemented in the next three days.”\n\nRoberts did not write his own dissent, but rather the opinion simply reflects a notation that he would’ve denied the application.\n\nThe appeal stemmed from the administration’s decision to terminate grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. “Yet the district court’s order is enabling many of those grantees to request payments on their grants, which grantees now have an incentive to do quickly,” acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in the March 26 application.\n\nShe highlighted an example of a grant that, she wrote, “funded a project that involved a ‘racial and ethnic autobiography’ that asked whether individuals ever ‘felt threatened? marginalized? privileged?’ and how they would ‘seek to challenge power imbalances.’” Another, she wrote, “sought to ensure that teachers were ‘purposeful in implementing cultural and SEL [social-emotional learning]/DEI practices with fidelity.’”\n\nThe appeal came as the Trump administration seeks to dismantle the Education Department. It also represented just one of the administration’s several recent complaints to the high court about lower court judges running amok in the administration’s view. Harris wrote that the case “exemplifies a flood of recent suits that raise the question: ‘Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever)’ millions in taxpayer dollars?”\n\nShe was quoting from Justice Samuel Alito’s dissent from the court’s March 5 refusal to help the government avoid paying nearly $2 billion in foreign aid funds for already completed work. The court split 5-4 in that case, and the administration wants to flip that dissent to a majority as it presses a series of urgent appeals in the early days of Trump’s second term.\n\nFriday’s decision therefore represents at least a temporarily significant victory for the administration. Whether it reflects an outlier or the start of a trend could become clearer with several other emergency decisions pending on immigration, employment and birthright citizenship.\n\nOpposing the application, a coalition of states led by California wrote that the federal government was seeking extraordinary relief from the justices that it wasn’t entitled to. The states noted that the government was asking not only to halt the lower court’s temporary restraining order but also to summarily overturn it.\n\nIn addition, the states accused the government of taking its problems with other cases out on this one.\n\n“It appears that defendants’ real concern is not with this case or the courts below; it is with other cases in other ‘forums across the country’ where courts are grappling with a raft of legal disputes arising out of recent actions by the Executive Branch,” the states wrote, citing the administration’s application and adding: “Those concerns are properly litigated in the context of those other cases.”\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

    "title": "A lawsuit opposing Trump's tariffs rightly cites the Constitution",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "The details of President Donald Trump’s promised tariffs have been announced, and as many Americans are mourning what the plummeting stock market is doing to their 401(k) plans and investment accounts, others are asking if his tariffs are even legal. Does Trump, or any American president, really have the power to unilaterally impose these tariffs?\n\nDoes Trump, or any American president, really have the power to unilaterally impose these tariffs?\n\nA Florida company that sells stationery supplies believes he doesn’t, and on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Trump and other members of his administration, alleging that the president lacks the ability to impose tariffs on China. The suit’s argument, boiled down, is that while Trump claims he has the power to levy these tariffs under a federal statute called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (“IEEPA”), he does not have such power.\n\nWe knew that legal challenges to the Trump tariffs would come and that they’d argue that Trump had exceeded the admittedly broad authority Congress has granted presidents.\n\nThere is perhaps a more foundational question, though. Why is a president imposing tariffs at all, when the Constitution grants that power to Congress? You wouldn’t necessarily know it if you’ve been listening to the president, but the Constitution assigns the power to regulate foreign commerce and impose tariffs to Congress, not the White House.\n\nSo why does Trump believe that he has the power to do what he’s doing? The answer is that for almost a century, Congress has ceded much of its authority to regulate foreign commerce to the president. Congress’ abdication of responsibility allowed presidents to usurp that power and impose their own will on our global trading partners. And, as we see with the tumbling stock marking, putting such decisions in the hands of one person can bring potentially disastrous results. This is not what the founders intended. Those who drafted our Constitution envisioned a government of truly shared power, between three co-equal branches, two of them political. Sadly, on the issue of imposing tariffs, the legislative branch hobbled itself to the benefit of the executive branch.\n\nIn 1934, in the middle of the Great Depression, Congress delegated much of its authority when it passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, giving the president the power to negotiate trade agreements and make certain changes to U.S. tariff rates without congressional approval. Thus, Franklin D. Roosevelt, our country’s 32nd president, was the first one granted the power to unilaterally alter tariffs.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, our country’s 32nd president, was the first one granted the power to unilaterally alter tariffs\n\nThree decades later, in 1962, Congress passed the Trade Expansion Act, which gives the president the power to change tariffs based on an investigation and determination by the Department of Commerce that some imports pose a national security threat. During his first administration, Trump used this power much more liberally than his predecessors, and he twice imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum pursuant to his power under that law’s Section 232. He is relying on the same section of that law this term to reimpose tariffs on steel and aluminum, which he alleges are necessary to maintain national security.\n\nTwelve years after the Trade Expansion Act, Congress relinquished even more power over foreign commerce to the executive branch. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 gives the U.S. trade representative, a Cabinet member, the power to impose trade sanctions on foreign countries when they break trade agreements or harm U.S. commerce by taking actions that are “unjustifiable” or “unreasonable.” Indeed, the Trump administration cited Section 301 when it imposed “reciprocal tariffs” this week. Trump has argued that China has broken one or more trade agreements, thus providing a pathway to impose sanctions (aka tariffs) on goods imported from there.\n\nEmily Ley Paper, the Florida company that sued the Trump administration on Thursday, argued that the government is seeking to illegally “bypass” those trade statutes. The suit focuses on yet another statute, the above-mentioned IEEPA, arguing that it does not provide the president the power to impose taxes. In fact, the suit points out that no president has ever used that law to impose tariffs. The plaintiffs argue that, even if the IEEPA does provide presidents with the power to levy tariffs, that is only the case when there is a national emergency that trade sanctions can alleviate.\n\nTrump says his tariffs are a response to the flow of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the United States. But the plaintiffs allege that there is no real connection between the tariffs on China and the opioid crisis.\n\nWhile there may be an inclination to think that the conservative U.S. Supreme Court might bless the Trump administration’s broad claim of executive authority, the type of challenge we see being made in Thursday’s lawsuit might gain new traction with the court for three reasons spelled out in that lawsuit.\n\nUnder what’s called the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot simply throw up its hands and delegate its constitutionally mandated duties to the executive branch.\n\nFirst, there’s the foundational argument that Congress simply ceded too much authority to the president. The Constitution gave the power to impose tariffs to Congress. Though Congress gave that power away to another branch of government 150 years later, it may not have had the power to do that. Under what’s called the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot simply throw up its hands and delegate its constitutionally mandated duties to the executive branch. While it’s true that in 1976 the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a portion of Section 232 on the Trade Expansion Act was not an unconstitutional delegation of power from Congress to the president, that Supreme Court differed greatly from the one we have now. Chief Justice John Roberts’ conservative court may be willing to revisit this case, or at least embrace a more robust view of the nondelegation doctrine.\n\nA second related argument is that Congress has violated the “major questions doctrine,” under which Congress must provide clear authorization before an executive agency can decide an issue of national significance.\n\nAlthough the history of our courts indicates that judges will generally defer to the president’s decisions in this area, a recent Supreme Court case provides yet a third reason to wonder if Trump’s power will be checked in this case. In June 2024, Roberts wrote the opinion overturning the doctrine of “Chevron deference” and concluded that courts should exercise independent judgment and not defer to an executive agency’s interpretation of a congressional statute when it is ambiguous. This would allow courts to perform a more searching review of actions that Trump takes under the congressional statutes authorizing him to impose tariffs in certain circumstances.\n\nA federal judge or the Supreme Court may pump the breaks on Trump’s tariffs. But the best solution to this problem that’s destroying Americans’ investment accounts is not to rely on the judiciary. It is instead for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority and claw back the power it should have never given (and may not have been constitutionally allowed to give) to the White House.",

    "title": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s cure for measles is making infected kids even sicker",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "As of Friday, the Texas Department of State Health Services had reported 481 confirmed cases of measles, which would put the total number of cases in the U.S. well over 600 since the start of the year. During all of 2024, fewer than 300 measles cases were reported across the entire United States.\n\nAnother thing is showing up in the routine lab work for unvaccinated children with measles: liver damage.\n\nMore than 50 children have been hospitalized in Texas, and the vast majority of cases and hospitalizations are occurring in unvaccinated kids. One unvaccinated school-age child has died. In addition to measles itself, another thing is showing up in the routine lab work for unvaccinated children with measles: liver damage. According to the physicians treating such children at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, vitamin A toxicity from high doses of cod liver oil is the most likely culprit.\n\nCod liver oil, which Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has touted in several Fox News interviews as a cure and prophylaxis for measles, contains a rich amount of vitamin A. Symptoms of vitamin A toxicity include dry skin, fatigue, blurred vision, bone pain and the above-mentioned liver damage. In some cases, too much vitamin A can cause a person to fall into a coma or even die.\n\nSince the beginning of the measles outbreak in Texas, Kennedy has downplayed the role of vaccines in preventing measles. In a March 2 op-ed that he wrote for Fox News’ website, he claims to care about the dissemination of “accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy” and says vaccines should be available “for all those who want them.”\n\nBut in the same piece, Kennedy writes that it is also “our responsibility to provide up-to-date guidance on available therapeutic medications.” That’s when he argues that the “CDC has recently updated their recommendation supporting administration of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate, and severe infection. Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality.”\n\nDespite Kennedy’s claims that cod liver oil, steroids and antibiotics can be used to prevent or treat measles, the only evidence-based method that has been shown to prevent against a measles infection is vaccination. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two shots of the MMR vaccine provides 97% protection against the disease.\n\nSymptoms of vitamin A toxicity include dry skin, fatigue, blurred vision, bone pain and liver damage. In some cases, too much vitamin A can cause a person to fall into a coma or even die.\n\nChildren showing up at hospitals with vitamin A toxicity underscores the importance of effective communication of lifesaving information.\n\nWith the exception of measles cases that are the result of international travelers bringing it into the U.S., the disease has spread across 19 states because of misinformation. Instead of deliberately and intentionally advocating for parents to inoculate their children against measles, as every responsible public health official should, Kennedy has instead expressed support for alternative therapies that are proven not to prevent measles.\n\nWords matter, particularly the words from leaders who have the power and influence to shape public behavior. Words have consequences, and we can see the results of inaccurate public health messaging in Texas. Parents are deciding on alternative therapies to treat measles rather than giving their children the vaccines that science shows prevent infection.\n\nThese parents are causing their own children to suffer. No otherwise healthy child should be in the hospital. They should be enjoying their childhood playing outside with family and friends. Instead, these children with vitamin A toxicity are being hospitalized, put on medications and being given fluids intravenously.\n\nThe vast majority of the measles cases across the United States, and certainly all the hospitalized cases, could be entirely prevented with vaccines. The measles outbreak will not improve until vaccination rates improve and a concerted effort is made to combat the rise of vaccine hesitancy that Kennedy and other anti-vaccine advocates have push onto many Americans. To that end, our influential public health leaders must provide clarity and transparency when discussing and educating the public about how to prevent measles.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on his nomination on Jan. 29. Alex Wroblewski / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nIt is not enough to claim that vaccines are an important part of measles prevention but then promote cod liver oil, antibiotics and steroids for therapy when an active measles outbreak is affecting hundreds of Americans. Lives are at stake. One child has already died, and that’s one too many.\n\nIf innocent children continue to suffer and be hospitalized for a completely preventable disease, shouldn’t leaders who are spreading misinformation be held accountable? Where is the justice for the dozens of people, most of them children, who are suffering in Texas hospitals because their parents used remedies recommended by irresponsible government officials?\n\nIn a time where misinformation can spread swiftly through social and mass media, we need real public health leaders who can communicate effectively and clearly. The lives of our children depend upon it.",

    "title": "Trump fired federal workers who provide energy assistance during brutal heat and cold",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Louisiana gets hot. Brutally hot in the summer. In 2023, New Orleans had about 20 sweaty nights when the temperature never dipped below 80 degrees. Ours is the kind of heat that requires air conditioning to sleep, and it often feels like we need AC just to breathe.\n\nImagine you’re already struggling with the high cost of living. Your rent has spiked, your grocery bill has spiked even more, it’s summer in Louisiana, and because you can’t afford your $350 electricity bill, you receive a disconnection notice. How do you survive?\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has fired the 10-person staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.\n\nThat’s a question about 6 million American families will be asking now that President Donald Trump’s administration has fired the 10-person staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.\n\nA bipartisan effort to protect America’s most vulnerable households, LIHEAP has been around since 1981, but now it’s one of the many federal programs that is seriously threatened in the latest round of stunning layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. While the dollars are dispensed to residents by locally trusted community action agencies, LIHEAP is a federal program with experienced administrators who ensure the funds are put to best use. Again, every one of the program’s administrators has been fired.\n\nTens of thousands of elderly or disabled residents and households with children depend on lifesaving support from LIHEAP to stay safe in Louisiana’s extreme summers. Our state receives roughly $53 million annually to help people manage electric and gas bills.\n\nLIHEAP is fundamentally about helping vulnerable Americans pay their home energy bills. But it’s much more than that. Energy costs are housing costs, and when a family falls behind on utilities, the effects can cascade, leading to the loss of housing, food, health care and other essentials. Unfortunately, disconnections for inability to pay are already on the rise, causing illness and death. Between June and August 2023, extreme heat in Louisiana cost 25 people their lives, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.\n\nI run the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a policy organization in Louisiana working to ensure everyone has access to the energy they need to thrive. Residents threatened with disconnection call us year-round, and we direct them to LIHEAP, which helps them make ends meet when they are forced to choose between food and medication or keeping the lights on. There’s a good reason LIHEAP is a health program.\n\nBut LIHEAP isn’t just about paying bills. The program has also provided millions of dollars each year to help weatherize homes. Many of our homes are ill-equipped to keep occupants safe, healthy and comfortable during July’s heat dome or January’s polar vortex, and LIHEAP weatherization funds help reduce wasted energy, which saves us all money in the long run. Weatherization includes sealing up leaks around doors and windows, installing insulation and making air-conditioning systems more efficient. The Weatherization Assistance Program, which is largely funded by LIHEAP, is an investment that puts money directly into homes, reducing the need for bill assistance in the future. To paraphrase the old parable, give a family cash assistance and they can pay their bills that month; weatherize that family’s home, and they’ll be able to afford their bills year-round.\n\nUtilities around the country also depend on LIHEAP revenue to cover their costs when their customers can’t pay. If utilities aren’t able to meet their operating costs, then they’ll need to turn to their regulators and ask for rate increases, and rate increases raise everyone’s bills. This means that LIHEAP has benefited every American household for nearly 45 years. You’ve benefited from it, even if you’ve never applied for help. This administration keeps using the word “efficiency,” but this appears to be yet another cut that make things generally less efficient and hurts not only the most vulnerable people who apply to LIHEAP, but all of us.\n\nIt’s been surprising that the LIHEAP staff being fired hasn’t led to broad objections from regulators and utilities nationwide. Utilities have historically been very outspoken advocates for LIHEAP and have joined consumer advocates and community action agencies in annually lobbying Congress for more funds. That’s because the program has always been underfunded. But according to a piece by the Energy and Policy Institute, since the firing of the LIHEAP staff was announced April 1, utilities have largely stayed mum or refused to comment either on the impacts it will have on their customers or on their own bottom lines. It is puzzling and concerning that some of the most powerful voices on this issue are staying silent.\n\nTemperatures in some part of Louisiana reached 89 degrees Thursday, and as spring gives way to the even more intense heat of summer, I worry about the tens of thousands of Louisianans who are already barely making ends meet and can’t access LIHEAP funds. These layoffs and federal cost-cutting measures are dangerous, and every legislator, regulator and utility has a responsibility to protect programs like LIHEAP, a program that is a clear example of how government efficiency and “cost saving” is already being achieved, even as millions of Americans are helped.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the April 7 episode of “Morning Joe.”\n\nThe markets are in crisis following Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs announcement last week, with experts warning that a recession could be on the horizon. According to a new survey from CNBC, a majority of CEOs, 69%, now say they expect a recession. That comes just days after JPMorgan’s economics team raised their recession probability to 60%.\n\nThe administration has tried to brush off these recession fears, sending out their top officials to defend Trump’s tariffs and pretend like there’s nothing to see here. Trump’s ultra-wealthy Cabinet members, like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, are taking to the airwaves to tell middle-class and working-class Americans, entrepreneurs, people who have spent their entire lives building up their family businesses, that “there’s nothing to worry about; this had to be done.”\n\nIf you hear Republicans saying they can’t do anything, that’s just a lie.\n\nAlthough the focus right now is on the stock market and the banks, the people who will be hurt most by Trump’s trade war aren’t the millionaires and billionaires in his administration, it’s working-class Americans — the people who can afford it the least. And right now, those hardworking Americans are being told by Trump’s billionaire buddies that there’s nothing to see here.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about tariffs, what we’re witnessing is a self-induced war that Trump, with the backing of the Republican Party, started.\n\nSince November’s election, I have been warning Republicans that they needed to be careful. The U.S. has the strongest economy in the world, but it has to be managed wisely. And now, Republicans are standing by as Trump drives that strong economy into the ground.\n\nRepublicans are not powerless here. The GOP-controlled Congress has the power to stop Trump’s trade war. They have the power to moderate it. They have the constitutional power to decide if 46% tariffs are too much to push on Vietnam. They have the power to make this less tough on American businesses. They have the power to talk and negotiate with the president and come up with something that’s not quite as extreme. If you hear Republicans saying they can’t do anything, that’s just a lie.\n\nAmericans can’t fall for these lies. They must understand that when this administration goes on television and says that this has to be done, they’re not telling the truth. And when Republicans refuse to stand up to Trump and tell the American people they can’t do anything about it, that’s not true either. It’s doublespeak.",

    "title": "Trump’s attacks on law firms aim to alter the balance of power in American democracy",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "The Trump administration’s recent executive actions targeting some of the country’s most prominent law firms should not be mistaken for routine political conflict. These moves signal a deeper strategy to weaken Democratic-leaning institutions and profoundly and permanently alter the balance of power in American democracy.\n\nAs political scientists who have studied the politics of the legal profession, we recognize Trump’s executive orders as part of a broader pattern. Like elite university professors and students, the legal profession, particularly at its highest levels, tilts to the left. Our research shows that lawyers are significantly more liberal than the general population. This ideological bent is especially pronounced at the nation’s top law schools — the very institutions that produce the attorneys at the firms targeted.\n\nThe firms Trump targeted first were not chosen randomly.\n\nThis isn’t just a reflection of educational polarization, in which higher levels of education increasingly correlate with left-leaning political views. Even compared with other highly educated professionals, such as doctors and business leaders, lawyers are among the most reliably left-leaning. That reality ironically makes “Big Law” — despite its traditional role defending big businesses and moneyed interests — a formidable adversary for an administration seemingly intent on dismantling opposition piece by piece.\n\nAnd the firms Trump targeted first were not chosen randomly. These firms do not just employ some left-leaning lawyers; they are among the most liberal in the country. Our analysis finds that WilmerHale, Paul Weiss, Jenner & Block, and Perkins Coie — all firms that have been prominently targeted by Trump in recent weeks — rank in the most left-leaning quartile of top American law firms. WilmerHale, Jenner & Block, and Paul Weiss sit within the top 25 most liberal law firms nationwide.\n\nThese firms also don’t just lean left; they are Democratic power centers, deeply embedded in the intersection of law and politics. They exert influence in many ways: direct lobbying, fighting critical court battles over voting rights and providing campaign cash through donations and fundraising. Many federal judges and candidates, as well as staffers for Democratic presidential administrations, come from these firms. Perkins Coie, the first firm targeted by Trump, frequently represents Democratic Party interests.\n\nBut Trump’s targeting of law firms goes beyond mere partisan retribution. Policy is forged not only through legislation and regulation but also through litigation. Law firms are central actors in this, often acting as critical counterweights to government power. Their ability to bring complex cases, backed by resources and expertise — often deployed via pro bono efforts — makes them essential players.\n\nBy kneecapping some of the most effective legal adversaries on the left, Trump is attempting to tilt the scales in conservatives’ favor — not through victories in the courtroom, but through the outright elimination of the opposition.\n\nDisturbingly, Trump’s pressure is yielding results.\n\nBarring firms from obtaining security clearances, threatening government contracts, or restricting federal employee contact — key provisions in these executive orders — doesn’t just deprive law firms of clients; it cripples their ability to function effectively across numerous practice areas, potentially denying due process to numerous clients. The goal is clear: to sap these firms of their power, marginalize their influence and send a chilling message to any other legal entity contemplating a challenge to administration policy or actions.\n\nDisturbingly, Trump’s pressure is yielding results. Though firms like Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Perkins Coie are challenging these orders in court, others have bent the knee. The settlements by Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps — in which they agreed to provide millions in legal services for causes favored by the administration — have emboldened the president and his administration to continue their campaign of intimidation.\n\nWe have criticized the legal profession in the past for its resistance to public oversight and its outsize political influence. In turn the bar has continued to claim a unique position for lawyers as guardians of democracy. Having carved out and defended this privileged position — deserved or not — the legal establishment now faces a defining moment. Lawyers cannot credibly claim a special role in protecting democratic norms while simultaneously compromising with those undermining them.\n\nThe stakes for the legal profession are high. The more firms respond in isolation, hoping to avoid Trump’s ire, the easier it will be for Trump to pick them off one by one. An independent, robust and liberal-leaning legal profession presents too much of a risk to the Trump administration. The entire profession — Big Law, the legal academy and bar associations — must present a unified front to resist these encroachments, something we have begun seeing with the news that more than 500 firms have voiced support to Perkins Coie in its legal fight against the administration. Bar associations, which set ethical rules that lawyers must follow, will be particularly important in mandating that law firms not be punished for the clients they represent. With individual partners nervous about losing business, it is crucial that firms, law schools and bar associations be more vocal.\n\nBecause if they don’t, they may not only lose the battle for their profession, but we may lose a critical pillar of how U.S. democracy operates.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Actress Aimee Lou Wood, one of the surprise standouts of the third season of “The White Lotus,” is having what she describes as a “full circle” moment ahead of Sunday’s season finale. Amid a cast stacked with the likes of Parker Posey, Walton Goggins and Carrie Coon, an unlikely new star has emerged: Wood’s buckteeth.\n\nWood’s character, a young woman named Chelsea, meets Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon), another resort guest, early in the HBO drama. In one of the most memorable lines of the season, Chloe breaks the ice with disarming candor. “I love your teeth,” she tells a smiling Chelsea. “You’re from England, right?”\n\nWood later told the online magazine The Face that the line was actually improvised, beautiful in its simplicity.\n\nCalled ‘radical’ and ‘inspiring,’ Wood’s decision not to ‘fix’ her teeth has earned her fans — a lot of them.\n\nCalled “radical” and “inspiring,” Wood’s decision not to “fix” her teeth has earned her fans — a lot of them. Some are so fascinated with Wood’s overbite — a flare complete with a large space between her two front teeth — that the actress has felt compelled to warn against overeager DIY copycats. Dentists and orthodontists meanwhile have taken to TikTok to diagnose Wood’s dental condition, sight unseen.\n\nFans can be extraordinarily ridiculous; this is not a new phenomenon. In Victoria-era Britain, Alexandra, the Princess of Wales, developed a limp after a case of rheumatic fever. Before long, her female fans and followers decided to imitate the so-called “Alexandra Limp,” with some going so far as to purchase shoes with mismatched heels in order to achieve it.\n\nBut for those of us with a wild set of chompers, Wood’s claim to fame is both welcome and bittersweet. My own malocclusion (the medical term for teeth that dare to exist one way or another in misalignment) combined with a set of cruel and vicious peers made my childhood a living hell.\n\nLike Wood, I suffered years of intermittent bullying, with some of the worst abuse delivered by adults. Anyone with a craniofacial anomaly (another fancy term for anyone born with facial structure that dares to deviate from the socially accepted norm) knows that living with defiant teeth can be brutal. In my case, the bullying and unsolicited criticism was life-altering.\n\nMy own experiences inspired a bestselling children’s book on the same topic, so I also know what it’s like to face your pain and come out the other side triumphant. But unlike Wood, I’ve never met an orthodontist or dentist who said they “wouldn’t change a thing” about my teeth or smile — even after extensive treatment.\n\nI remember when, at 23 years old, I moved from New York City to suburban New Jersey and found a new local dentist. After the standard pleasantries, he tapped my front teeth with his pointer finger and said, “This isn’t very nice.”\n\nSuch moments, beginning around the time I turned 8 years old, shaped what became a lifetime of severe body dysmorphia. I endured three separate rounds of braces across three decades to correct an overbite. My stubborn front teeth, however, resisted even the most modern orthodontic technology. Mine is a deeply structural problem. I was born with misaligned jaws that could only be corrected with orthognathic surgery.\n\nMy dysmorphia has proven just as entrenched. Despite various (and expensive) treatments, I am still unable to imagine my teeth as anything other than socially unacceptable. And I envy Wood’s seeming self-acceptance.\n\nBut while cultural attitudes do seem to be changing in Hollywood and on fashion runways, it’s a slow process.\n\nBut while cultural attitudes do seem to be changing in Hollywood and on fashion runways, it’s a slow process.\n\nAccording to 2022 data published by the the American Association of Orthodontists, there are over 3 million children between the ages of 8 and 17 receiving orthodontic treatment. A good chunk of orthodontic patients, around a 25% or more, are adults. Indeed, according to the British Orthodontic Society, demand for orthodontic treatment is increasing in Britain.\n\nBut this quest for the perfect smile is often wildly expensive, even for “easier” cases.\n\nIt’s also impermanent. Teeth shift as we grow older. When I finished my third round of braces 13 years ago, my teeth were perfect. But I knew I would have to wear retainers and a bite guard for the rest of my life in order to maintain all of that grueling work. And even despite these efforts, my teeth have shifted.\n\nWood, of course, is also a beautiful, thin white young woman and an excellent actress. In this context, her “perfectly imperfect” teeth arguably add to her appeal in a way that might not be true for someone less conventionally attractive. I also don’t think that words like novel or inspiring are the compliments people seem to think they are — instead, they suggest just how brainwashed we’ve become when it comes to conventional beauty. The reactions also highlight an enduring sense of entitlement; an intense need to judge others, and especially to judge their bodies. This entitlement, as both Wood and I have experienced, can be life-altering for those on the receiving end.\n\nWhile I could have really used Wood’s newfound notoriety when I was growing up, it shouldn’t take a celebrity’s “radical” natural features for the rest of us to feel a little more socially acceptable.",

    "title": "Trump wants the Federal Reserve to bail him out",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "Though the Trump administration inherited a strong economy, in under three months, it has generated a steep stock market sell-off and deep concerns about where things are headed. The market losses Thursday and Friday were worse than 99.9% of all trading days since 1929, and Monday morning brought even further declines. This historical sell-off was without doubt the result of Trump’s big “Liberation Day,” when he revealed a set of tariffs that raises the average U.S. tax on imports to levels not seen in almost a century.\n\nTariffs of this magnitude pose an especially tough challenge for the economy. Because they are largely passed forward to consumers, they raise prices. And because they similarly raise the price of inputs for domestic producers — 45% of our imports are “intermediate goods” — they raise the cost of production, which hurts growth. Add to these woes the tremendous uncertainty created by Trump’s on-again, off-again policy lurching, along with the aforementioned market meltdown, and you understand a) why both consumer and investor sentiment has fallen off a cliff, and b) why economic forecasters have lowered their growth expectations and raised their inflation forecasts.\n\nFaced with stagflation, what’s a central banker to do?\n\nThis combination of lower growth and faster inflation is called stagflation, and it is a particular challenge for the Federal Reserve. To counteract slower growth, Fed officials can lower the benchmark interest rate they control. But to counteract inflationary pressures, they typically raise rates. Faced with stagflation, what’s a central banker to do?\n\nTheir best play is to leave rates where they are until it is clear which problem requires addressing with a rate change. In fact, that’s just what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday. Given that the appropriate path for Fed policy is “not clear at this time,” he said, “it feels like we don’t need to be in a hurry.”\n\nSo, what’s the problem? Well, here’s what the president posted on Truth Social that same day, as the stock market was tanking: “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates. He is always “late,” but he could now change his image, and quickly.”\n\n“CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!” Trump concluded.\n\nNow, to understand what’s going on here, we need to go back to one of Powell’s predecessors, Alan Greenspan. Under Greenspan, the Fed was so consistent in cutting rates as soon as the market softened that investors came to depend on the Fed chair to protect them from bear markets. This was known as the “Greenspan put,” a reference to a financial tool by which an investor is protected from downside losses.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not saying Trump is an avid student of monetary history. I am saying he wants and expects Powell to bail him out, and he know there’s a precedent for the Fed to provide a macroeconomic insurance policy against a policy shock, even if it’s Trump’s own doing.\n\nIf you let the president oversee the central bank, the risk that he will force it to overly juice the economy is just too high.\n\nHis post also reveals that he’s clearly uninterested in a guiding principle of past administrations, including the Biden presidency, during which I chaired the Council of Economic Advisers. When I was asked about Fed policy, with zero exceptions, my answer was to say nothing. Well, not exactly nothing, but nothing more than this: “We don’t talk about Fed policy because we are fully committed to Fed independence. History is littered with examples of economies severely damaged by the inflation unleashed by pressuring the Fed to cut rates.” In fact, at CEA, we published a detailed defense of this stance, showing the historical importance of Fed independence, especially to control inflation.\n\nIt’s common sense. If you let the president oversee the central bank, the risk that he will force it to overly juice the economy is just too damn high.\n\nThere’s one more important wrinkle here for the Fed to consider. Because a tariff is a tax that takes effect at a point in time and stays on until it’s lifted, it does raise prices, but it does so just once. You get a spike in inflation over a month or two, and then inflation drifts back to where it was pre-tariff. Economists call this a “one-time rise in the price level” versus a permanently higher inflation rate.\n\nThe Fed probably doesn’t like that anymore than you or I do, but as long as inflation doesn’t stay elevated, it doesn't have to raise interest rates to get it back down.\n\nThat could work to Trump’s advantage — unless the tariffs just keep coming. Remember, the scenario I just outlined requires one and done. But if Trump keeps lurching around the way he has since he got back into office, the producers, businesses and employers who set prices and wages in the economy are going to expect ever-higher price pressures.\n\nThis is a huge problem for the Fed that deeply depends on inflationary expectations remaining “anchored.” A one-time hit doesn’t dislodge the anchor. But repeated hits definitely can. As Powell said Friday, “While tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation, it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent … Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”\n\nThe upshot is that Powell and the Federal Reserve must ignore Trump, maintain independence, watch what happens to both policy and inflation, and raise or lower rates as they see fit. But ignoring Trump is a lot easier said than done. Especially if the markets keep tanking, Trump will demand a “Powell put” with increasing fury. But the Fed chair is unquestionably right about tuning Trump out, and those of us who speak on such matters should give him all the backup we can.",

    "title": "Netflix’s ‘Adolescence’ drags us through the manosphere in search of answers",
    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "In the third episode of Netflix’s No. 1 hit series, “Adolescence,” 13-year-old Jamie, the boy arrested on suspicion of murdering his classmate Katie with a kitchen knife, speaks with a clinical psychologist. The psychologist is pretty, dressed in a flattering blue chiffon blouse, and exudes a kind of feminine strength. Her appearance matters to Jamie. The episode underscores Jamie’s feelings of inadequacy, his desire for acceptance, his anger and, crucially, the way he views women in relation to himself.\n\nFilmed, like each installment in the series, in one linear shot, the episode is a claustrophobic and gutting watch. In fact the entire four-part series, following Jamie, his family and the police as they attempt to understand what drove this child to violence, is a gripping, necessary lesson in modern day masculinity and the chilling realities young men today face.\n\nSince “Adolescence” premiered on Netflix about three weeks ago, 96.7 million people around the world have streamed it.\n\nSince “Adolescence” premiered on Netflix about three weeks ago, 96.7 million people around the world have streamed it. That number’s likely higher by now. “Adolescence” is the ninth most watched series of all time on Netflix, beating out the third season of the mega-popular “Stranger Things.” I watched it for the first time just a few days ago. I waited because, honestly, it just felt too heavy of a lift.\n\nI’m married just over a year. My husband and I are beginning to talk about children, a family. Sometimes it’s a fun conversation — What would their names be? Would they inherent my husband’s musical abilities and his gentle stoicism? Would they like to read and write like me? — and sometimes it’s a scary, serious conversation. “Adolescence” sparked one such conversation. After watching it, I felt deeply fearful for my future children and for our society.\n\nThe show is an examination of how a confluence of typical factors — cyberbullying, an underfunded school, a lack of community or belonging, coming-of-age angst, an inability to communicate, and the deadly influence of the internet’s “manosphere” — can create an utterly broken and dangerous young man. In her book “The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity and Love,” crucial feminist and civil rights scholar bell hooks writes, “The first act of violence that patriarchy demands of all males is not violence toward women, instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves. If an individual is not successful in emotionally crippling himself, he can count on patriarchal men to enact rituals of power that will assault his self-esteem.”\n\nUltimately, “Adolescence” is a condemnation of patriarchy. For all the discussion around that word, there is a consistent frustrating and fundamental misunderstanding of what patriarchy is. The textbook definition, the social order that gives men a disproportionately larger share of social, economic and political power, doesn’t make it clear that it exists at the cost of both men and women. The patriarchy — this is critical — hurts men.\n\n“Adolescence” also grapples with the dangerous and very real manosphere, the deeply misogynistic faction of the internet pioneered by the likes of self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate. Users often enter the rabbit hole with tutorials on how to charm women, ultimately how to get women to have sex with them and how to be “masculine.” But the further you go, the more misogynistic the content becomes: from deeply regressive gender roles to violence and degradation against women. Fundamentally, the manosphere casts blame on women and feminism for the crisis of male loneliness. In one scene, Jamie brings up the so-called 80-20 rule to his therapist, an obviously incorrect concept that posits 80% of women are attracted to only the “top” 20% of men. The 80-20 rule allows men to, again, cast blame on women for their lack of romantic prospects. Instead of looking inward and examining what might be repelling a possible partner, it’s women’s fault for never giving the other 80% of men a chance. Jamie tells his therapist that he agrees.\n\nI’m one of the lucky ones. I know good men. I have a father who gave me the gift of self-esteem, two brothers with whom I have genuine respectful relationships, and a loving husband who views me as an equal, a partner. I have wonderful uncles, cousins, and friends. I’ve also known bad men. I’ve given out a fake phone number or lied about having a boyfriend to end an uncomfortable interaction. I’ve heard countless men qualify their misogynistic beliefs with a Democratic voting record. I’ve calculated the cost of saying no. I’ve feared for my life while alone with a man. But like I said, I’ve ultimately been lucky.\n\nI’m not yet a parent. I don’t have the answers, nor the experience. I do know one thing, though: I am grateful that I will raise a child in the wake of “Adolescence.”\n\nI’m not yet a parent. I don’t have the answers, nor the experience. I do know one thing, though: I am grateful that I will raise a child in the wake of “Adolescence.” I am grateful for the conversations I hear and read that are happening right now, because of this series. The show and the devastating story it tells has sparked heavy and painful conversations between couples, parents, sons and their parents, sons and their fathers, and, God willing, between young men.\n\nOne of the final scenes in the last episode of “Adolescence” takes place between Jamie’s parents. They sit shoulder-to-shoulder on their neatly made bedspread and discuss, through tears, where they failed their son. “Adolescence” is careful to make it clear that they are not to blame. Jamie didn’t come from a home without love. His heinous act of violence wasn’t born from another heinous act of violence.\n\nThere is no easy fix and there is no single scapegoat. The solution isn’t merely removing cellphones and limiting internet access. The solution isn’t blaming parents, or teachers, or little girls. If we keep talking, though, perhaps we will find one.",

    "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
    "content": "The major stock market indexes were not open over the weekend, but as The New York Times reported, Wall Street was not quiet. Executives, many of whom backed Donald Trump’s candidacy last year, responded to the White House’s trade tariffs with “anger, anxiety, frustration, and fear.”\n\nThe Times’ report added, “One prominent deals lawyer described himself as ‘flabbergasted’ as he grappled with how far the share prices of his clients had fallen. A top Goldman Sachs executive summed up the frustration with Mr. Trump succinctly: Someone has to stop him.”\n\nOther prominent voices have spoken up in similar ways. Billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman — who backed Trump’s candidacy and publicly defended the then-candidate’s economic agenda during the 2024 campaign — wrote over the weekend, “Business is a confidence game. The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe. The consequences for our country and the millions of our citizens who have supported the president — in particular low-income consumers who are already under a huge amount of economic stress — are going to be severely negative.”\n\nAckman added, “This is not what we voted for.”\n\nReactions like these reminded me of a recent Washington Post column from Catherine Rampell, a new MSNBC anchor, who marveled at the degree to which Wall Street is “shocked that President Donald Trump is destroying the robust economy he inherited.”\n\nWere any of these people watching the same campaign the rest of the country saw? Trump’s self-sabotaging agenda was not subtext; it was explicit text, often delivered in all caps. He devoted much more time in his rally speeches to trade wars and fantasies of retaliation against personal enemies than to corporate tax breaks. And some commentators (ahem) tried to convey that even if those precious tax cuts passed, there’s a lot more to capitalism than low taxes.\n\nThe column was published two weeks before the White House rolled out its radical tariffs agenda, sending global markets into a tailspin.\n\nRampell added, “C-suite executives and market analysts have no excuses for getting Trump’s economic agenda wrong. They are paid to make accurate predictions and to follow incremental regulatory and legislative developments. They were supposed to know that the ‘Tariff Man’ might raise tariffs, and that the guardrails were being dismantled. They went into this eyes-wide-open.”\n\nIf you spend enough time online, you’ll probably see references to the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party. I’ve seen this summary making the rounds, and it’s is as good as any: “Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party refers to a parody of regretful voters who vote for cruel and unjust policies (and politicians) and are then surprised when their own lives become worse as a result.”\n\nIt appears to have started in 2015 with someone who wrote, “‘I never thought leopards would eat MY face,’ sobs woman who voted for the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party.”\n\nThe more Trump’s Wall Street backers recoil in reaction to the agenda they helped advance, the more the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party comes to mind.",

    "title": "Divisive ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’ episode airs months after Kenya Moore left the show",
    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "Bravo aired a controversial moment from \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" on Sunday that led to the exit of star Kenya Moore, an incident from last year when she showed sexually explicit photos of a fellow cast member.\n\nThe incident became public in June, when TMZ reported that Moore showed the images of new cast member Brittany Eady at an event. Moore was reportedly placed on suspension and eventually parted ways with Bravo.\n\nThis season's fifth episode showed the incident Sunday, but Bravo did not allow the images to be aired.\n\nTensions between Moore and Eady boiled over in the previous episode when the two got into a verbal argument at a cast dinner. By the end, Eady made threatening remarks as she left, insinuating she'd shoot Moore.\n\n\"I still got my pistols, so,\" Eady said at one point. She later followed up with: \"I don't play them games. I got whips ... pistols, everything.\"\n\nMembers of the production crew are seen on camera as Eady makes the comments, momentarily breaking the fourth wall, but they are not shown speaking to Eady as others try to calm her down.\n\nMoore is then seen getting in a car with fellow cast members, alerting them that Eady is \"talking about guns.\"\n\n\"She was talking about how 'I still got my pistol on me,'\" Moore is heard saying off camera. \"This girl is a problem. She gotta go.\"\n\nBrittany Eady in Atlanta last year. Prince Williams / WireImage\n\nThe episode ends there, and the following week Eady expresses contrition about her remarks to other cast members. She appears at the grand opening party of Moore's salon with flowers to apologize. Moore ignores the attempted apology and has apparently already decided to respond to the threats by using the party to humiliate Eady by showing sexually explicit images of her. Eady leaves the event before the images are shown.\n\n\"So this woman was saying all this stuff like 'You don't know who the f--- I am,'\" Moore tells the crowd, referring to Eady. \"I'm like, no I don't know who you are. So I did a little research.\"\n\nMoore pulls out poster boards with the images of Eady and shows them to the crowd while cameras roll. The images are not shown on camera, but others describe them.\n\nFellow \"Real Housewives\" cast members are visibly uncomfortable over Moore's display and tell Moore she is going \"too far.\"\n\n\"No, it ain't too far ... she threatened me with a gun,\" Moore tells them. \"Don't tell me it's too far.\"\n\nCast member Porsha Williams, who said in her confessional interview that she was mortified, was filmed leaving the opening party along with multiple other cast members. Williams then told production staff members that she was ready to go and no longer wanted to be filmed.\n\nEady clearly did not consent to the images’ being shown at the event. She captioned a short video of herself Sunday on Instagram: \"I’m still standing strong no matter what.\"\n\nShe did not address the incident during the episode.\n\nBravo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe episode ends with a title card that read: \"Based on Kenya's behavior, the decision was made to cease filming with her this season.\"\n\nFans on social media had vocal reactions, many condemning Moore's behavior while, at the same time, criticizing the production staff for not having responded to Eady's threats before the situation escalated.\n\n\"You can’t threaten someone with gun violence and dictate how they respond to that threat,\" a viewer wrote on X.\n\nAnother person wrote, \"I HATE how Kenya retaliated but the way Bravo handled this (TO ME) was unfair.\"\n\n\"The real villain is the network/production for not stepping in when Brit mentioned a gun,\" a fan posted. \"I don’t know how in the world she was able to get away with that. That could have prevented Kenya from going this far.\"",

    "title": "Bill Murray says masked kiss led to sexual misconduct allegation that shut down movie",
    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "Bill Murray said a masked kiss in 2022 on the set of a movie led to sexual misconduct allegations that eventually shut down the film, an incident the famed actor says still bothers him and feels he was “barbecued” for.\n\nIn 2022, a female staff member working on the film set for “Being Mortal” accused the \"Ghostbusters\" and \"Groundhog Day\" star of behaving inappropriately with her. The film, directed by Aziz Ansari, was eventually shelved by Searchlight Pictures.\n\n“I don’t go too many days or weeks without thinking of what happened in ‘Being Mortal,’” the 74-year-old actor told The New York Times in an interview published Saturday.\n\nHe explained that he had known the woman who made the complaint, and the incident involved him kissing her as they were both wearing face masks that were part of Covid-19 protocols.\n\nMurray and the woman eventually reached a settlement, Deadline reported. The woman was never identified by anyone affiliated with the movie and has not come forward to comment on the matter.\n\nWhen asked to discuss what unfolded, Murray said, \"I tried to make peace. I thought I was trying to make peace. I ended up being, to my mind, barbecued.\"\n\n“But someone that I worked with, that I had had lunch with on various days of the week — it was Covid, we were all wearing masks, and we were all stranded in this one room listening to this crazy scene. I dunno what prompted me to do it. It’s something that I had done to someone else before, and I thought it was funny, and every time it happened, it was funny,\" Murray said.\n\n\"I was wearing a mask, and I gave her a kiss, and she was wearing a mask,\" he explained. \"It wasn’t like I touched her, but it was just, I gave her a kiss through a mask. And she wasn’t a stranger.\"\n\nHe said the incident still “bothers me.”\n\n\"Because that movie was stopped by the human rights or 'H & R' of the Disney corporation, which is probably a little bit more strident than some other countries’. It turned out there were pre-existing conditions and all this kind of stuff. I’m like, what? How was anyone supposed to know anything like that? There was no conversation, there was nothing. There was no peacemaking, nothing,\" Murray said.\n\n\"It went to this lunatic arbitration, which, if anyone ever suggests you go to arbitration: Don’t do it. Never ever do it. Because you think it’s justice, and it isn’t,\" he continued.\n\nThe veteran comedian and critically acclaimed actor, who has a long history of alleged bad behavior on movie sets, said he thinks the whole experience was \"stupid.\"\n\n\"You can teach an old dog new tricks. But it was a great disappointment, because I thought I knew someone, and I did not. I certainly thought it was light. I thought it was funny,\" he said. \"To me it’s still funny, the idea that you could give someone a kiss with a mask on. It’s still stupid. It’s all it was.\"",

    "title": "American readers are worried books will get pricier thanks to tariffs",
    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "President Donald Trump’s tariffs have some of the internet’s most voracious readers worried: the price of books and access to them could be changed significantly.\n\nMembers of BookTok, TikTok’s passionate community of readers, have expressed dismay at the possibility of book prices increasing, as well as the news that some international booksellers were re-evaluating their policies on selling to the United States.\n\n“This has gotten so far beyond out of hand, and the book industry is a small industry in the greater world,” said TikTok creator Lia Reads, whose video on how tariffs will affect the book industry has been viewed more than 600,000 times.\n\nOver the past few days, dozens of others within the BookTok community have posted similar videos sounding the alarm over tariffs, with several people referencing a different creator’s November 2024 video in which she had suggested that Trump’s re-election would mean the return of $10 paperbacks.\n\nPrint books and children’s picture books currently feature on a list of exempted products released by the White House on April 2 alongside Trump’s executive order, meaning that items such as Bibles printed on thin paper and baby board books, the majority of which are printed abroad, may not be affected.\n\nBut new tariffs could increase the cost of manufacturing books, in turn narrowing publishers’ profit margins and, ultimately, raising the price at the cash register, according to Brian O’Leary, executive director of the Book Industry Study Group, a U.S. trade organization that includes some of the largest book publishers.\n\nMost books sold in the United States are printed domestically, but the necessary raw materials are still imported, as well as machine parts needed to maintain the printing equipment itself. In 2023, the United States imported more than $409 million worth of paper, much of which is used for printing books. As much as 73% of that came from Canada.\n\n“Taken as a whole, these additional duties may increase costs in the short term, as the price of consumables rise,” O’Leary said in an email. “In the longer term, tariffs may also affect the cost of domestic manufacturing, if presses become more expensive to purchase and maintain.”\n\nThere is also some confusion around how tariffs would affect Americans’ ability to buy books sold abroad. Some U.S. readers prefer to buy their favorite titles from foreign retailers due to the pull of earlier release dates, exclusive content and collectible different editions.\n\n“Waterstones, if you see this, can you please make sure I get my signed copy of Katabasis in September please?” one BookTok member said, referring to the United Kingdom-based bookstore and the upcoming novel by bestselling author R.F. Kuang. “I’ll pay the extra money, I don’t care.”\n\nIn an Instagram post Saturday promoting a different new release, Waterstones clarified that “Customers in the USA are able to order from us whilst we work on the implications of new tariffs. Any future charges will be indicated at checkout.”\n\nResponding to a comment below the post asking, “If I already pre ordered (about 2 months ago) do I have anything to worry about?” Waterstones replied, “I mean there’s plenty to worry about, in the world, but your order will be fine.”\n\nThe retailer did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.\n\nThe BookTok community’s concern over tariffs comes as its members continue to debate whether books should be separate from politics. In the months leading up to the election, some creators pushed for a “politics-free” BookTok. Others, including best-selling author Jodi Picoult, have argued that books are inherently political, citing the recent book bans.\n\nMany readers who lamented the potential impact of tariffs simultaneously expressed concerns that authors may be less likely to travel for book tours as some U.S. residents and visitors report being detained at U.S. borders and some countries warn against travel.\n\nRomance novelist Ali Hazelwood, who is originally from Italy and resides in the United States, said she’s canceling her U.K. tour and opting for virtual events instead, writing in a post on Instagram: “This is because of several complicated reasons that mostly boil down to the fact that, things being what they are, it’s not possible for me to safely travel outside and then back inside the US.”\n\nA representative from Penguin Random House, Hazelwood's U.S. publisher, declined to comment, saying via email that Hazelwood did not want to speak to the media about the issue.\n\n“Do you all remember back during the election, when there was this huge hubbub all over Bookstagram, all over BookTok, about how we shouldn’t talk about politics? That books aren’t supposed to be political?” BookTok creator Cait, known as Beneath the Covers NYC on the platform, said in a video mentioning tariffs. “Well, you might want to rethink that.”",

    "title": "Trump says the U.S. will hold direct talks with Iran as he insists Tehran can't get nuclear weapons",
    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Monday the U.S. will hold direct talks with Iran about its nuclear program, while warning the Iranians they would be in “great danger” if the talks don’t succeed in persuading them to abandon their nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe president, in comments to reporters after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the talks will start Saturday. He insisted Tehran can’t get nuclear weapons.\n\n“We’re dealing with them directly and maybe a deal is going to be made,” Trump said. He added that “doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious.”\n\nAsked if he would commit to military action against Iran should his negotiators be unable to come to terms with Tehran, Trump responded that “Iran is going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it.”\n\n“If the talks aren’t successful, I think it’s going to be a very bad day for Iran,” Trump said.\n\nIran’s mission at the United Nations had no immediate comment Monday.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nTrump recently sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader, 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling for direct negotiations with the United States over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. But Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said late last month that Iran had rejected Trump’s entreaty while leaving open the possibility of indirect negotiations with Washington.\n\nBut Trump has consistently called on Iran, which is the chief sponsor of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthi militants in Yemen, to abandon its nuclear program or face a reckoning.\n\n“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” Trump told NBC News in late March. “It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.”\n\nTehran’s chief envoy to the U.N., Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani, has called on members of the Security Council in a series of letters to condemn Trump’s threats of bombing Iran.\n\nTrump during his first White House term withdrew the U.S. from the landmark nuclear accord with Iran negotiated by Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration.\n\nNetanyahu says he supports Trump’s diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement with Iran, adding that Israel and the U.S. share the same goal of ensuring that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe Israeli leader, known for his hawkish views on Iran and past calls for military pressure, said he would welcome a diplomatic agreement along the lines of Libya’s deal with the international community in 2003.\n\n“I think that would be a good thing,” he said. “But whatever happens, we have to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons.”\n\nTrump said the talks would happen “at almost the highest level,” but declined to say where the negotiations would take place or who he was dispatching for the sensitive diplomacy.\n\nThe Middle East sultanate of Oman was an important conduit for previous U.S.-Iran negotiations and has been the go-between for the recent swap of letters about reopening negotiations between Trump and Khamenei.\n\nTrump announced plans for the surprise engagement as Netanyahu made a hastily arranged visit to the White House — his second in just over two months — to discuss the tariffs Trump has unleashed on countries around the world, Iran’s nuclear program and the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Trump declared he was making the world safer, but he also deepened his isolation on the world stage and revived doubts about American credibility.\n\nThe agreement, which also included Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, had lifted most U.S. and international economic sanctions against Iran.\n\n“I think it’ll be, different and maybe a lot stronger,” Trump said on how a new deal might be different from the one negotiated by Obama officials.\n\nTrump and Netanyahu said they also discussed tensions with Iran, Israel-Turkey ties and the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant against the Israeli leader last year. Trump in February signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC over its investigations of Israel.\n\nBefore his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump held a call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II. All three leaders have been key interlocutors in efforts to tamp down tensions in the Middle East and bring an end to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe prime minister soon after arriving in Washington on Sunday evening met with senior Trump administration officials, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jameson Greer, to discuss the tariffs. And Netanyahu met on Monday with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, ahead of his sit down with the president.\n\nOn tariffs, Netanyahu said he assured Trump that his government would move to erase the trade deficit. U.S.-Israel trade was $37 billion last year, according to the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The trade deficit was $7.4 billion.\n\n“We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States,” Netanyahu said “We intend to do it very quickly.”\n\nTrump noted that in addition to the trade deficit the U.S. provides Israel nearly $4 billion in assistance per year — much of it in military aid. Asked if he might be willing to reduce Israel’s tariff rate, Trump replied, “Maybe not, maybe not. Don’t forget we help Israel a lot.”\n\nEytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations, said he expected Trump to use the tariffs as leverage to force concessions from Netanyahu.\n\nIn Israel’s case, those concessions might not be economic. Trump may pressure Netanyahu to move toward ending the war in Gaza — at the very least through some interim truce with Hamas that would pause the fighting and free more hostages. Gilboa said Trump is hoping to return from his first overseas trip — expected next month to Saudi Arabia — with some movement on a deal to normalize relations with Israel, which would likely require significant Israeli concessions on Gaza.\n\nIf he does manage to move toward bolstering ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, that would act as a regional diplomatic counterweight to pressure Iran, against which Trump has threatened new sanctions and suggested military action over its nuclear program.\n\nIn a preemptive move last week, Israel announced that it was removing all tariffs on goods from the U.S., mostly on imported food and agricultural products, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office.\n\nBut the tactic failed, and with a 17% rate, Israel was just one of dozens of countries that were slapped with tariffs on Trump’s so-called Liberation Day last week.\n\nAlthough Israel is a tiny market for U.S. products, the United States is a key trade partner of Israel. Much of that trade is for high-tech services, which are not directly affected by the tariffs, but key Israeli industries could be impacted.\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Israel estimates that the tariffs will cost Israel about $3 billion in exports each year and lead to the loss of 26,000 jobs in industries that include biotechnology, chemicals, plastics and electronics. The World Bank says Israel’s gross domestic product, a measure of economic output, is over $500 billion a year.\n\n“The damage won’t stop at exports,” said Ron Tomer, the group’s president. “It will scare investors, encourage companies to leave Israel and undermine our image as a global center of innovation.”",

    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.\n\nHappy Monday! In today’s edition, we break down the latest fallout from Washington to Wall Street as President Donald Trump forges ahead with new tariffs that have led to global economic uncertainty.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\n— Adam Wollner\n\nTrump digs in on tariffs amid another volatile day for the stock market\n\nPresident Donald Trump pressed forward with aggressive tariffs that have roiled the global economy as he faced pushback from Wall Street, world leaders and some members of his own party.\n\nHere’s the latest on where the trade war stands:\n\nTrump plows ahead: Trump said he is “not looking” to pause his tariffs before they go into effect Wednesday.\n\n“We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us,” Trump said. “They’re going to be fair deals, and in certain cases, they’re going to be paying substantial tariffs.”\n\nAsked whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation — a point his advisers struggled to clarify last week — Trump insisted that “they can both be true.”\n\n“There could be permanent, and there could also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,” he said. “So we’re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country.”\n\nStock market volatility: The markets ended largely lower Monday after a wild trading day. The S&P closed down 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.9%, or 350 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day up 0.1%, led by a rally in chipmaker Nvidia, which finished 3.5% higher.\n\nU.S. markets whipsawed as investors grasped for any shred of news that indicated Trump would relent on his tariffs plan. A widely circulated but false headline saying he was considering a 90-day pause sent markets skyrocketing for a brief time.\n\nNew threat over China: Trump threatened additional tariffs of 50% on China if it doesn’t rescind its retaliatory measures of 34%. That’s in addition to his announcement last week, meaning the total tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China would be as much as 104% if they were fully implemented.\n\nTalks with Japan: Trump said Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba “was sending a top team to negotiate” after the two leaders spoke over the phone.\n\nCalling Trump’s 24% tariff on Japanese goods “extremely unfortunate,” Ishiba — whose country is the single largest foreign investor in the United States — said he told Trump during their 25-minute call that he was “deeply concerned that these American tariff measures will reduce the investment capacity of Japanese companies.”\n\nThe view from Wall Street: Major figures in the business world have spent the last few days sounding the alarm about the economic consequences of Trump’s tariff policies, with some even reversing their previous supportive stances of him.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter that Trump’s tariffs would “slow down growth” as “input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.” On Friday, the bank raised its odds for a recession from 40% to 60%.\n\nDimon’s comments are a sharp reversal from those he made in January urging people to “get over” Trump’s tariff policy because they were “good for national security.”\n\nBillionaire investor Bill Ackman said on X that “the global economy is being taken down because of bad math,” capping off a weekend of missives that called for a 90-day pause on tariff implementation and others aimed at Trump’s policy team.\n\n“This is not what we voted for,” wrote Ackman, who endorsed Trump during the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe view from Capitol Hill: Republicans in Congress are still largely sticking by Trump through the tariff turbulence, though new cracks have continued to emerge.\n\nA bipartisan Senate bill that would limit the president’s power to impose tariffs now has seven Republican co-sponsors. But the White House officially said Trump would veto the legislation if it reached his desk, meaning it would take two-thirds of the GOP-controlled House and Senate to turn it into law. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said of the bill: “I don’t think that has a future.”\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mike Lee of Utah posted on X in favor of Trump’s taking up the European Union on its offer of zero-for-zero tariffs.\n\nOver in the House, some anxious Republicans are seeking more guidance about Trump’s broader plans. During a House GOP conference call over the weekend, Rep. Darrell Issa, of California, asked whether lawmakers could get a detailed briefing from the White House about Trump’s tariffs. And Rep. French Hill, of Arkansas, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, expressed some frustration with how the White House has handled the tariff situation.\n\nStill, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Congress would give Trump “the space necessary” to handle tariffs.\n\nRead more:\n\nReader poll\n\nDo you think Trump’s tariffs will be in place in the long term?

    "title": "'Doomsday mom' Lori Vallow represents herself in trial over killing of 4th husband",
    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "Lori Vallow Daybell, the \"doomsday mom\" who received multiple life sentences for the murders of her two children and romantic rival, gave her opening statement Monday in a separate trial over the death of her fourth husband.\n\nVallow Daybell, who is serving as her own counsel, presented a timeline of the events leading to the July 11, 2019, fatal shooting of Charles Vallow, 62, by her brother, Alex Cox, characterizing them as tragic but far from criminal or planned.\n\nShe said that the day Cox shot Vallow, her husband got into an argument with her daughter, Tylee Ryan, who was then 16, and threatened her with a bat.\n\nThough the couple were estranged, Vallow had come to her residence in Chandler, Arizona, about 25 miles southeast of downtown Phoenix, to pick up his son, police said in a statement. According to the police account, an argument between Charles Vallow and Vallow Daybell started, and her brother intervened.\n\n\"Charles lifted up the bat to hit Tylee,\" she said Monday in her opening remarks. \"Alex then intervened.\"\n\nShe said a struggle for the bat ended with her husband in control of the weapon. \"Charles prevailed with the bat and began to come toward me,\" she said.\n\nShe said that \"at some point\" during her effort to flee, \"Alex apparently retrieved his gun.\"\n\n\"Alex shot Charles in self-defense,\" she said.\n\nBut, she said, it wasn't until she returned from taking son Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow, 7, to school that she learned from police that Charles had died.\n\nVallow Daybell said she was interrogated by police and paired with a victim's advocate, \"who was very kind to us.\"\n\nA Maricopa County, Arizona, grand jury indicted Vallow Daybell, 51, in June 2021 on a charge of conspiracy to commit murder. It was later upgraded to first-degree murder.\n\nShe has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn her opening statement, she said there is no evidence that she and her brother planned the killing of her husband. She doesn't dispute that Cox fatally shot Vallow, but she said he did so in self-defense and in defense of her daughter.\n\nWhat happened that summer morning, she suggested in her opening statement, was spontaneous family violence sparked by Charles' anger and problems with Tylee.\n\n\"A family tragedy is not a crime,\" she concluded.\n\nProsecutor Treena Kay said earlier in her opening statement that Vallow Daybell wanted Vallow dead \"to better her life.\"\n\nKay accused Vallow Daybell of conspiring with Cox, who died later that year from a pulmonary embolism and was never charged.\n\n\"Lori ... used religion ... as justification to kill Charles Vallow,\" Kay said.\n\nIn the months before his death, Charles Vallow had filed for divorce and expressed concern for his safety. In a police body camera video from a January 2019 incident, he told officers that his wife had \"lost her mind.\"\n\nHe said that he had returned home from a business trip and that she had taken his car and locked him out of their home. He told police that Vallow Daybell was dangerous and that she had threatened to kill him. The video showed an officer asking Charles Vallow how she posed a threat to their children, JJ and Tylee.\n\n\"I don’t know what she’s going to do with them,\" he said at the time. \"Flee with them. Hurt them.\"\n\nPolice eventually told Charles Vallow that the situation wasn't criminal and that they weren't able to require a mental health check on her at the time. He was dead six months later.\n\nVallow Daybell was sentenced in 2023 to life in prison without the possibility of parole after she was convicted in the murders of JJ and Tylee, as well as conspiracy to commit murder in the death of Tammy Daybell.\n\nAt her trial, witnesses described how she believed some people were \"zombies\" or possessed by evil spirits, including JJ, Tylee and Charles Vallow.\n\nThe children disappeared in September 2019, sparking a monthlong search that ended when police found their remains on property belonging to Vallow Daybell's fifth and current husband, Chad Daybell.\n\nTammy Daybell was Chad Daybell's wife. She died in 2019, weeks before he married Vallow Daybell. In a trial last year, he was convicted in the deaths of Tammy Daybell, JJ and Tylee. He was sentenced to the death penalty.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with NBC's \"Dateline,\" Vallow Daybell said she was falsely accused and convicted in the deaths of her children and Tammy Daybell. She said she and Chad Daybell would be exonerated because Jesus showed her the future, and they were not behind bars.\n\nAsked about the Arizona trial, she said she felt \"great\" acting as her own attorney.\n\nSeparately, Vallow Daybell is charged with conspiring to kill Brandon Boudreaux, her niece's estranged husband. A trial date has not been set. She has pleaded not guilty.",

    "title": "Trump holds firm on tariffs as the White House looks for ways to calm nervous allies",
    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "Donald Trump sees an opportunity to “change the fabric” of the United States with his sprawling plan to institute new global tariffs — a policy that has had markets shaking for days while cracks form in his political coalition.\n\nBut even as the president, administration officials and key allies say he will not back down from his tariff plan, they are looking for ways to ease the concerns of wary supporters. The measures include talking up the potential to cut deals with key trading partners, pointing to tax cuts as a way to balance out the economic hit and deploying officials to speak to jittery business groups.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\n“The feeling among Hill Republicans is we’ve got to get rolling on the tax cuts right now,” a senior Senate Republican aide said. “We have to offer some candy to the business community in terms of offering them certainty and helping with pro-growth policies.”\n\nTwo administration officials confirmed that members of the administration were taking calls from business groups and setting up private meetings to allay worries.\n\n“The Trump administration maintains regular contact with business leaders, industry groups, and everyday Americans, especially about major policy decisions like President Trump’s reciprocal tariff action,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “The only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making, however, is the best interest of the American people — such as addressing the national emergency posed by our country running chronic trade deficits.”\n\nThe tariffs — which could quickly become the defining policy of his second term — put two core Trump identities in conflict: the protectionist who spent decades calling for steeper tariffs to combat what he sees as the country’s being ripped off by its trading partners, and the deal-maker, the persona he spent years building in New York real estate and as the protagonist of “The Apprentice.”\n\n“Nobody but me would do this,” Trump told reporters Monday in the Oval Office. “You know, it would be nice to serve a nice, easy term, but we have an opportunity to change the fabric of our country. We have an opportunity to reset the table on trade.”\n\nAllies push back\n\nMarkets have not been fans of resetting the table. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 had smaller dips Monday as administration officials talked up dealmaking and a misleading headline briefly led investors to believe Trump was pausing the measures. Since Wednesday, when Trump announced his tariffs — which were calculated using a widely derided formula based on U.S. trade deficits with other countries — the Dow and the S&P 500 have both declined by more than 10%.\n\nTrump’s billionaire backers and business executives are sounding the alarm. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Trump’s tariffs will weigh down the economy and raise prices. Bill Ackman, the outspoken Trump supporter and billionaire hedge fund executive, railed against the policies in a series of social media posts over the weekend, calling on Trump’s advisers to revise their tariff formula “before the President makes a big mistake,” suggesting all capital gains will be wiped out in 2025. Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports and a vocal Trump supporter, readied for a turbulent day for markets Monday that he proclaimed “#orangemonday,” a not-so-thinly veiled shot at the president.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles made at least one phone call over the weekend to an associate asking about the level of concern in the private sector about the market downturn, according to a person close to the White House.\n\nAnother member of the business community who seems displeased by Trump’s tariff agenda is Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has been Trump’s right-hand man in rapidly slashing government programs and workers. Musk promoted free trade and went after Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade adviser, saying Navarro “ain’t built s--t.” He also also laughed at at Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s explanation for the administration’s placing tariffs on an uninhabited island.\n\nA senior White House official, who insisted Trump’s team is not worried about cracks forming in the coalition, said, “Elon is entitled to his own opinion.”\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump started his Monday calling for supporters to weather the storm.\n\n“The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!”\n\nA White House official stressed Monday that the president and the White House have no set period for how long they would endure the market strain, emphasizing that offering such a timeline would open Trump up to additional criticism should they continue past it.\n\nBut administration officials, including Trump, spent the last few days touting how many countries are calling them up to cut deals to avert or lower the new tariffs, with multiple officials touting outreach from 50 countries.\n\n“They’re offering things to us that we wouldn’t have even considered asking for,” Trump said Monday in the Oval Office.\n\nThe White House official named Vietnam, Cambodia, Israel and Poland as countries seeking to quickly come to agreements.\n\nBoth Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday praised a call with Japanese officials to negotiate an agreement while criticizing China for quickly retaliating against Trump’s new measures. Trump has threatened further escalation with China if it does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs by Tuesday, saying he will impose an additional 50% tariff on top of what he has already proposed.\n\nThere is a universe where the Trump administration ramps up a trade war with China while cutting deals with other countries. Steve Bannon, a Trump ally and former top White House official, said Monday the trade war would soon focus much more on China.\n\nChina “dared to cross Trump with retaliation after they had been warned,” Bannon said. “The Trade War they have been pursuing for years against America is now going to get hot. Isolated from the world, this is a war China can’t win.”\n\n‘The markets don’t scare him’\n\nThe White House and the president himself continue to offer mixed messaging about their game plan. Asked Monday whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, Trump insisted that “they can both be true.”\n\nOther administration officials have been more insistent that the tariffs are coming regardless of any negotiations. Lutnick said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that “there is no postponing” the new tariffs, claiming it will soon be a reality that “the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing, is going to come to America.”\n\n“They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,” Lutnick said of the measures.\n\nAsked about Vietnam in an interview Sunday on Fox News, Navarro said, “This is not a negotiation.” On Monday, he told CNBC that Vietnam’s offering to reduce its tariffs to zero “means nothing to us, because it’s the non-tariff cheating that matters.”\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., said more clarity about the tariffs from Trump “would help a lot.”\n\n“Some of the president’s aides are saying we need to do this to raise money; other aides are saying we need to do this to make other countries pay us back for ripping off America through unfair trade,” Kennedy said. “Others have said it’s good news because many countries want to lower their tariffs, in some cases to zero, which I happen to think is good news. They’re just all over the map.”\n\n“I think it would be better if they would talk to their boss and find out what the message is,” he added. “It’d actually be better if some of them would shut up, but that’s not likely to happen.”\n\nA senior Senate GOP aide who supports Trump’s effort to reorient global trade reiterated that congressional Republicans “don’t really know what’s going on.”\n\n“This is what he’s wanted to do his whole life,” this person said. “And he does not care. He truly believes this and wants to correct it. The markets don’t scare him. He’s just going to push through.”\n\nThe White House sought Monday to promote support of his policy, highlighting comments from groups like the United Auto Workers and the National Council of Textile Organizations.\n\n“I think there’s some who believe in what he is doing and the need for short-term pain to address long-standing trade imbalances and some who think this is pure chaos with no real thought behind it,” said a Republican strategist who has worked with the White House previously. “Corporate world is frustrated with the lack of clarity. Political world is frustrated that he and the White House have not made their case in a consistent enough way.”\n\nCongressional unrest\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will testify before the Senate and House about Trump’s trade policy. In his opening remarks Tuesday, he plans to tell senators that Argentina, Vietnam, Israel and other countries have already indicated they will reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers to come to agreements.\n\nAlthough seven Senate Republicans have already signed on to a bill that would curtail Trump’s tariff powers — a bill he pledged Monday to veto if it is passed — two Republicans who spoke with NBC News said House Republicans are more nervous about the tariffs than their Senate counterparts. Those rank-and-file Republicans are starting to panic about the markets and want more guidance from the White House about Trump’s long-term strategy.\n\nDuring a House GOP conference call Sunday, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif, asked whether they could get a detailed briefing from the White House on tariffs, according to two people on the call. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told members that he would talk to Trump and vowed to arrange for someone in the administration to brief the conference, the sources said. They added that Johnson counseled members during Sunday’s conference call to just trust the tariff process and stand by Trump’s trade policy, arguing he helped deliver a strong economy during his first term.\n\nBut there are some signs of anxiety even among GOP leaders. Johnson has argued, both in a “Dear Colleague” letter over the weekend and on the conference call, that they need to quickly coalesce around a budget resolution — which Republicans need to unlock Trump’s tax and spending cut package — because of the market turmoil.\n\n“There is a fork in the road as to what’s going to happen,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on his podcast Monday. “If President Trump uses this moment as leverage, he’s got an extraordinary opportunity to lower tariffs of every country on Earth to U.S. goods and lower our own tariffs in response. … On the other hand, there are voices in the White House that want high tariffs forever. There are angels and demons sitting on President Trump’s shoulders. Who does he listen to? I hope he listens to the angels.”\n\nStephen Moore, a former economic adviser to Trump, said Trump must more effectively target his tariffs. Ultimately, the end game should be to negotiate new trade agreements.\n\n“At the end of the day, the only solution here that I can see is for the other countries to start making those phone calls to the Oval Office and making some deals with Trump,” he said.\n\nTrump spent the past weekend golfing at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, providing plenty of material to critics who said he was not taking the market downturn seriously.\n\nA person who was at the LIV Golf Tournament said the tariffs and the market downturn were not front and center.\n\n“It is not something that was much of a topic of conversation,” the person said. “I think there was sort of a storm cloud over it to some degree. I mean, people in the room were aware, no doubt, but it was just not the forum to bring it up, and it’s not like the sort of people who were going to bring up bad news or try and check Trump.”\n\nDemocratic activists organized large, nationwide protests Saturday opposing his administration, at which some protesters held signs decrying the impact of his policies on their 401(k) investments.\n\nA White House official told NBC News that Trump was not concerned about the optics of golfing amid the economic turmoil.\n\nThis person said Trump’s golfing during the market strain was like “going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery,” adding that he can enjoy his time in Florida while continuing to work when needed on weekends.\n\nThe official then expressed what administration officials are confident of — for now.\n\n“The economy will be fine,” this person said.",

    "content": "The United States does not have to return a Maryland man who was accidentally deported to a high-security prison in El Salvador to U.S. soil by midnight, the Supreme Court ruled Monday in an administrative stay that temporarily pauses a judge's previous order.\n\nThe 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday morning denied the administration's request for a stay of a judge's order demanding that Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a legal resident protected from deportation by a 2019 court order who has lived in the United States since 2011 — be returned to the country by 11:59 p.m. Monday.\n\nThe Supreme Court then issued an administrative stay Monday afternoon, with a request that Garcia’s team file a response by 5 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nAbrego Garcia was deported March 15 in what the Trump administration described as an “administrative error.“\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland issued the return order Friday, calling Abrego Garcia's deportation unlawful.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi welcomed the Supreme Court's decision and vowed to continue to \"protect the executive branch from judicial overreach.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, stressed to NBC News that the Supreme Court's action was a temporary stay.\n\n\"It doesn’t say how many days or even hours it’s going to last,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"But we have every confidence that the Supreme Court is going to resolve this matter as fast as possible.\"\n\nHe added that it has been a \"yo-yo\" weekend for Abrego Garcia’s family.\n\nIn a statement earlier Monday through the immigration advocacy group CASA, Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said the 4th Circuit court ruling \"gives me hope and even more encouragement to keep fighting.\"\n\n\"My children, family, and I will continue praying and seeking justice,\" she said.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia. CASA via AP\n\nOn Saturday, the Justice Department asked the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the order and asked Xinis to stay her own ruling as appeals are underway. She denied that request Sunday.\n\nIn its filing to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said, \"This order — and its demand to accomplish sensitive foreign negotiations post-haste and effectuate Abrego Garcia’s return tonight — is unprecedented and indefensible.\"\n\nBefore the higher court decision, Sandoval-Moshenberg said that if his client isn’t back in the United States by midnight, they plan to ask Xinis to use the \"full power of the court\" to enforce her order.\n\nJennifer Vasquez Sura, Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wife, speaks Friday in Hyattsville, Md. Jose Luis Magana / AP\n\nThe Trump administration argued that the midnight Monday deadline was \"arbitrary\" and \"impossible.\"\n\n\"The United States’ negotiations with a foreign sovereign should not be put on a judicially mandated clock, least of all when matters of foreign terrorism and national security are at stake,\" the filing claimed. \"It is the latest in a litany of injunctions or temporary restraining orders from the same handful of district courts that demand immediate or near-immediate compliance, on absurdly short deadlines.\"\n\nJohn Sauer, who was confirmed as U.S. solicitor general last week, wrote: \"The district court has no jurisdiction over the Government of El Salvador and thus no authority to order Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States.\"\n\nGuards lead a man Jennifer Vasquez Sura identified as her husband, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, through the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador.

Sandoval-Moshenberg said Abrego Garcia came to the United States in 2011 to flee gun violence, and gang members threatened to kill him in an attempt to extort his parents. The attorney also noted Abrego Garcia does not have a criminal record in the United States or El Salvador.\n\nXinis rejected that stay effort on Sunday, writing the government’s detention of Abrego Garcia was \"wholly lawless.\"\n\n\"Defendants seized Abrego Garcia without any lawful authority; held him in three separate domestic detention centers without legal basis; failed to present him to any immigration judge or officer; and forcibly transported him to El Salvador in direct contravention of the INA,\" Xinis wrote in her order. \"Once there, U.S. officials secured his detention in a facility that, by design, deprives its detainees of adequate food, water, and shelter, fosters routine violence; and places him with his persecutors.\"",

    "title": "RFK Jr. says he plans to tell CDC to stop recommending fluoride in drinking water",
    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "SALT LAKE CITY — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide, adding that he’s assembling a task force to focus on the issue.\n\nAlso on Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing “new scientific information” on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.\n\nKennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.\n\nUtah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.\n\nRepublican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.\n\nKennedy praised Utah for emerging as “the leader in making America healthy again.” He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state’s fluoride law. “I’m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,” he said.\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.\n\n“When this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency’s future steps,” Zeldin said. “Secretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.”\n\nFluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.\n\nKennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” and said also it’s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.\n\nFluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.\n\nAbout one-third of community water systems — 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. — serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.\n\nBut over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.\n\nA report last year by the federal government’s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter — more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. — was associated with lower IQs in kids.",

Kelley, getting cast in “L.A. Law,” “Picket Fences” and “Chicago Hope,” and later earning a Tony nomination for his Broadway debut at age 77 in a play about mismatched lovers, has died. He was 86.\n\nArndt died “peacefully in his bed” at his cabin home in Ashland, Oregon, his family announced in an obituary published March 26. It noted that he was born in 1939, the same year “The Wizard of Oz” came out.\n\n“That was like Dad’s life,” it said. “It started out in black and white and blossomed into a life of color, brilliance, daring adventure and passion. And it was also a little bit trippy, like Oz.”\n\nArndt was a Vietnam veteran helicopter pilot who twice was awarded the Purple Heart and later flew helicopters in Alaska. He turned to acting after moving to Seattle, spending multiple seasons at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and performing as an early member of the Intiman Theatre in Seattle.\n\nHis career began in the mid-1980s with roles on the TV shows “Crime Story” and “Wiseguy,” and he would spend the 1990s in TV and film, with a highlight being one of the cops interrogating Sharon Stone’s character in Paul Verhoeven’s “Basic Instinct.”\n\nDenis Arndt arrives at the Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York in 2017. Evan Agostini / Invision / AP file\n\nMaking his first and only Broadway appearance at age 77 opposite Mary-Louise Parker, Arndt received acclaim for his performance in “Heisenberg,” which debuted off-Broadway in 2015 before hitting Broadway a year later.In the play by Simon Stephens, babble-mouthed 42-year-old Georgie from New Jersey randomly meets a bored 75-year-old Irish butcher, Alex, in a London train station and the two begin a strange courtship.\n\nThe Associated Press was charmed by the performers and Stephens’ play: “He captures new love and old love at the same time, hope and fear, the new world and the old. He’s turned the simplest of tales — boy meets girl — into an unexpectedly rich thing with just two chairs, two tables and two actors.”\n\nOn TV, Arndt was a frequent Kelly collaborator, starting with “L.A. Law” and then as lawyer Franklin Dell on “Picket Fences” over four seasons. He also had roles on “Chicago Hope,” “Ally McBeal,” “The Practice,” “Boston Public,” “Boston Legal” and “Mr. Mercedes.”\n\nHis other small-screen credits include “Providence, “The Wonder Years,” “Murder, She Wrote,” “Life Goes On,” “Herman’s Head,” “Touched by an Angel,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and “The Good Fight.”\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Magee, and his children, Scott, Tammy, Laurie, Kirsten, Bryce, McKenna and Tanner.",

    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "Major figures in the business world have spent the last 48 hours sounding alarms about the economic consequences of President Donald Trump’s trade war — some even reversing their previous supportive stances.\n\nWhile many small businesses across the United States have for months decried Trump’s policies and the uncertainty they’ve injected into their operations, last week’s tariff rollout stunned America’s C-suites. In a CNBC flash survey of CEOs published Monday morning, 69% expected a recession, with 37% saying they expected to cut jobs this year.\n\n“Disappointingly stupid and illogical,” one CEO said in describing Trump’s tariffs to CNBC. “Without faith that our government knows what it is doing, it is impossible for businesses to thrive.”\n\nSpeaking in a televised interview with Bloomberg, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed the sentiments of the survey. “Most CEOs I talk to say we’re in a recession right now,” he said.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter that Trump’s tariffs would “slow down growth” as “input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.” On Friday, the bank raised its odds for a recession from 40% to 60%.\n\nDimon’s comments are a sharp reversal from those he made in January urging people to “get over” Trump’s tariff policy because they were “good for national security.”\n\nBut he isn’t the only business leader changing his tune following steep market losses and a myriad of recessionary indicators.\n\nBillionaire investor Bill Ackman said in an X post Monday morning that “the global economy is being taken down because of bad math,” capping off a weekend of missives that called for a 90-day pause on tariff implementation and others aimed at Trump’s policy team. The Pershing Square CEO also said that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick “profits when our economy implodes,” a statement he walked back hours later.\n\n“This is not what we voted for,” wrote Ackman, who also had officially endorsed Trump last summer.\n\nOn Sunday, billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said in a rare post on X — in response to another user posting a January interview on trade policy — that “I do not support tariffs exceeding 10% which I made abundantly clear.”\n\nRichard Branson, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Virgin Group, called on the Trump administration to “own up to a colossal mistake and change course” before the economic fallout spreads.\n\n“As the dollar is weakening, US consumer prices will rise,” Branson continued. “And countless small and medium-size enterprises will go, and already are going, bankrupt as a result. This is not a winning long-term strategy.”\n\nThe uneasiness has even spread to Trump’s own circle of advisers. In what appears to be his first major break with the president, billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk shared a seemingly anti-tariff video on X on Monday morning featuring an economist lauding the “operation of the free market.”\n\nMusk also said Saturday during a speech at an event held by Italy’s right-wing co-ruling party that “Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and America.”\n\nIn response, Peter Navarro — largely seen as the architect of Trump’s tariff policy — dismissed Musk as a “car assembler” in a CNBC interview Monday.\n\n“He’s a car person,” Navarro said. “That’s what he does, and he wants the cheap foreign parts.”",

    "content": "President Donald Trump said he is not looking to pause his tariffs before they go into effect Wednesday, despite turmoil in the stock market and global economic fears.\n\n“We’re not looking at that,” Trump said Monday when asked if he was thinking about taking more time to enact his sweeping tariffs. Instead, the president said countries could work to restore balance in trade relations with the U.S. through other actions.\n\n\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us,\" Trump said. \"They’re going to be fair deals, and in certain cases, they’re going to be paying substantial tariffs.\"\n\nFor some, those discussions are already underway, with the president touting a “very good” conversation with Japan on Monday, and saying that he expects that his administration will soon be speaking with China, among other nations. Tariffs on China are expected to rise to 104% on Wednesday.\n\nStill, when asked if the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation — a point that his advisers struggled to clarify last week — Trump insisted that “they can both be true.”\n\n“There could be permanent, and there could also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,” he said. “So we’re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country.”\n\nTrump’s comments follow days of market turbulence following his announcement last week of sweeping global tariffs. U.S. stock markets closed down again Monday after wavering through the day.\n\nDuring an extended back-and-forth over his tariff plans, the president broached his tariff agenda in legacy-defining terms, telling reporters that “it would be nice to serve the nice, easy term, but we have an opportunity to change the fabric of our country.”\n\nHe added, “It’s the only chance our country will have to reset the table — because no other president would be willing to do what I’m doing or to even go through it. Now, I don’t mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end.”\n\nNext to him sat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who moments earlier had promised to eliminate \"very quickly\" a trade deficit with the United States, as well as certain trade barriers. For nations looking to get back on even footing with the White House, Netanyahu said Israel could “serve as a model.”\n\n“Sometimes you have to take medicine,” Trump said over the weekend.",

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Monday threw out a judge's decision to block the removal of men alleged to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador without any legal process under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe ruling, in which the justices were divided 5-4 in part, means the Trump administration can try to resume deportations under the rarely used wartime law, so long as detainees are given due process.\n\nThe detainees must be given time to challenge their detentions via a habeas corpus claim and be able to challenge whether the act is being lawfully applied.\n\nThe fast-moving case concerns Trump’s aggressive and unprecedented use of presidential power in invoking the 18th century law, which has been used only when the country was at war.\n\nThe decision leaves various legal questions about the novel invocation of the Alien Enemies Act undecided, including whether the Trump administration can even invoke it against gang members.\n\n“AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,” the court wrote in its unsigned majority opinion.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nThe decision lifts orders issued by Washington-based U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who blocked the move on March 15, while litigation continues. The original lawsuit was filed by five Venezuelans, with Boasberg provisionally certifying it as a class action that applies to all Venezuelans in U.S. custody who are not U.S. citizens.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg in 2023. Valerie Plesch / Bloomberg / Getty Images file\n\nFive conservative justices were in the majority, while the three liberals dissented, joined in part by conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\n“The Government’s conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law,\" liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion. \"We, as a Nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" she added.\n\nLiberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson spoke to the historic nature of the ruling’s being issued Monday before Boasberg has even held a hearing on a preliminary injunction. She complained about a recent rise in the court deciding major cases on the emergency \"shadow docket\" without having extensive briefing and hearing oral arguments.\n\n“With more and more of our most significant rulings taking place in the shadows of our emergency docket, today’s court leaves less and less of a trace. But make no mistake: We are just as wrong now as we have been in the past, with similarly devastating consequences. It just seems we are now less willing to face it,” she wrote.\n\n\"At least when the court went off base in the past, it left a record so posterity could see how it went wrong,” she added, citing the notorious ruling that allowed government confinement of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\nThe government previously indicated in court that if Boasberg's order was lifted, it would immediately begin deportations.\n\nBoth sides claimed a level of victory.\n\n\"An activist judge in Washington, DC does not have the jurisdiction to seize control of President Trump’s authority to conduct foreign policy and keep the American people safe,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that the decision was a \"victory for commonsense security.\"\n\nLee Gelernt, lead attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs who were deported, said overall the group was pleased with the court's ruling.\n\n“We are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but the critical point is that the court rejected the government’s remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act,\" he said in a statement. \"That is a big victory.”\n\nThe Trump administration announced in February that it had determined that Tren de Aragua was a terrorist organization and that its members had infiltrated the United States. The administration, in a move that has been contested, says the group is effectively an arm of the Venezuelan government, which is led by President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nTrump then invoked the Alien Enemies Act, which can be used only when there are \"invasions or predatory incursions.\"\n\nBy making those findings, the Trump administration concluded that Tren de Aragua members could be immediately detained and deported without an opportunity for judges to determine whether the Alien Enemies Act applied or whether the people involved were even members of the gang.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs say the government's points-based method for identifying whether people are members is seriously flawed, relying in part on whether they have tattoos, leading in some cases to non-gang members’ being targeted.\n\nThe administration has argued that the Alien Enemies Act gives the president almost unfettered power to remove designated immigrants at short notice despite the constitutional protection of due process.\n\nThe Venezuelan plaintiffs argued in their own filing that the implications of the government's argument were \"staggering\" because it could allow officials to target a disfavored immigrant group on a whim.\n\nBoasberg's decision did not require any currently detained immigrants to be released or prevent deportations under different legal authorities. In fact, the Trump administration has continued to deport other immigrants to El Salvador.\n\nBoasberg's intervention prompted a barrage of hostile commentary from Trump and his allies, with Trump and others calling for the Boasberg to be impeached. That prompted a swift rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nOn March 26, a federal appeals court voted 2-1 to decline an earlier request to block Boasberg’s decision.\n\nConcerns were also raised about whether the administration had violated a verbal order from Boasberg in court that planes carrying alleged gang members turn around and return to the United States. Two flights subsequently landed in Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nUntil Trump's announcement, the Alien Enemies Act had been invoked only during three major wars: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",

What Microsoft had hoped would be a celebratory period has turned into a brutal few days for the company, which is being hit, along with the rest of the market, by President Donald Trump’s widespread tariffs. It’s a topic that CEO Satya Nadella and his two predecessors, Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, were forced to uncomfortably confront on Friday in an interview with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin.\n\n“As a Microsoft shareholder, this kind of thing is not good,” Ballmer said, about the tariffs.\n\nMeanwhile, the celebration itself captured headlines more for the protesters’ shared message than for Microsoft’s half-century of accomplishments.\n\nMicrosoft didn’t immediately provide a comment.\n\nThe first interruption on Friday came from Aboussad, who stood up during Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman’s speech.\n\n“Mustafa, shame on you,” Aboussad said as she walked towards the stage at the event in Redmond, Washington. “You claim that you care for using AI for good, but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty thousand people have died, and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region.”\n\nAboussad also called Suleyman a “war profiteer.”\n\n“You have blood on your hands,” she said before being swiftly escorted out. “All of Microsoft has blood on its hands.”\n\nShortly after the interruption, Aboussad sent an email, which was viewed by CNBC, to Suleyman and other Microsoft executives, including CEO Satya Nadella, finance chief Amy Hood, operating chief Carolina Dybeck Happe and Brad Smith, the company’s president.\n\n“I spoke up today because after learning that my org was powering the genocide of my people in Palestine, I saw no other moral choice,” Aboussad wrote in the email. “This is especially true when I’ve witnessed how Microsoft has tried to quell and suppress any dissent from my coworkers who tried to raise this issue.”\n\nAboussad continued in the email, “I did not sign up to write code that violates human rights,” adding a link to a “No Azure for Apartheid” petition.\n\nMicrosoft wrote in the internal message that Aboussad’s email to executives served as “an admission that you deliberately and willfully engaged in your earlier misconduct.” The company also said that Abousssad could have raised concerns “confidentially with your manager, or with Global Employee Relations. Instead, you chose to intentionally disrupt the speech of Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman.”\n\nThe document went on to say that Microsoft “has concluded that your misconduct was designed to gain notoriety and cause maximum disruption to this highly anticipated event.”\n\n“Immediate cessation of your employment is the only appropriate response,” Microsoft wrote.\n\nAt a separate Microsoft event with executives on Friday, Agrawal interrupted a speech from Nadella with a similar protest and sent an email to executives afterward.\n\n“You may have seen me stand up earlier today to call out Satya during his speech at the Microsoft 50th anniversary,” Agrawal wrote in the email, which was viewed by CNBC, on Friday. “Over the past 1.5 years, I’ve grown more aware of Microsoft’s growing role in the military-industrial complex.”\n\nAgrawal wrote that Microsoft is “complicit” as a “digital weapons manufacturer that powers surveillance, apartheid, and genocide,” adding that “by working for this company, we are all complicit.”\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson said Friday that the company is committed to adhering to the highest standards of business practices.\n\n“We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard. Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate,” the spokesperson said.",

    "title": "How an errant headline about a tariffs 'pause' briefly sent stocks soaring",
    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "An unfounded claim that President Donald Trump was considering pausing the implementation of sizable tariffs briefly sent U.S. stocks skyrocketing on Monday, an indication of just how volatile the current economic situation has become.\n\nJust after 10:10 a.m., a headline was posted by several well-followed finance-focused accounts on X that said White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett had indicated that Trump was considering a 90-day pause — China excluded — on his sweeping tariffs plan.\n\nThough unverified, the headline was instantly digested by investors — many of whom operate through algorithmic software that can parse information for buy or sell signals — and sent stocks soaring, reversing an earlier massive sell-off.\n\nThe unfounded headline got an extra boost when it was mentioned at about 10:14 a.m. ET on CNBC in an effort to explain the market’s moves (with one anchor noting the source of the claim was unclear) and then included the headline in an on-air graphic. The move resulted in trillions in gains in stock-market value in a matter of minutes.\n\nYet it soon became clear that no one could trace the origins of the alleged news. Hassett appeared earlier Monday on Fox News but did not mention a 90-day pause — though he was asked about one.\n\nThe White House later said on X that the claim was false, and one of the administration’s accounts reposted Hassett’s Fox News appearance to clarify that no such pause had been floated.\n\nAn attempt to create a timeline of Monday morning’s events points to the errant statement first spreading on X, then making its way to CNBC and Reuters. A CNBC spokesperson said: “As we were chasing the news of the market moves in real-time, we aired unconfirmed information in a banner. Our reporters quickly made a correction on air.” (CNBC and NBC News share a parent company, NBCUniversal.)\n\nA Reuters spokesperson said in an email: \"Reuters, drawing from a headline on CNBC, published a story on April 7 saying White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett had said that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause on all countries except China. The White House denied the report. Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error.\"\n\nA search of X shows that the first post mentioning Hassett and the pause came at 10:11 a.m. appears to have come from the account @yourfavorito, a finance-focused account with relatively few followers that regularly posts headlines about daily business developments. Identical or near-identical language was later posted by larger accounts, including some that are well followed in the finance world. Some of those posts have since been deleted.\n\nThe account that appears to have been the first to post the all-caps headline, which goes by a pseudonym, told NBC News their post was a reaction to seeing the headline on CNBC and Reuters, and pointed to a Reuters headline posted at 10:20 a.m., nine minutes after their own post.\n\nWhen asked over direct message if they had any evidence of a CNBC or Reuters post from before 10:11 a.m., they did not respond. The person behind the account said publicly that they had traded on the market’s swing.\n\nHowever, NBC News could not confirm that the account was the originator of the headline.\n\nThe person behind the account later posted that “trading desks started sending out this headline at 10:09” and that they were reacting to it.\n\nOne screenshot of what appeared to be a note from Goldman Sachs with the false headline circulated on social media in the aftermath of the market swings, but a spokesperson for the bank said it had been scouring its email traffic and found no evidence that was authentic.\n\nWhile it remains unclear exactly who first started the false Hassett claim, the swing highlights just how sensitive markets are to any hope that Trump will back down from his tariff plan, which dramatically overshadows any existing duties and has been roundly criticized by global leaders and business magnates.\n\nBut it is not the first time a social media rumor has dramatically affected markets. In 2012, The Associated Press’ Twitter account was hacked and used to post an erroneous headline of a bombing at the White House. U.S. markets dropped sharply on the post.",

    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "The mother and children detained by immigration authorities about two weeks ago in the small New York village where President Donald Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, lives were released Monday.\n\nJennifer Gaffney, superintendent of the Sackets Harbor Central School District, where the children are students, had been leading efforts to ensure the family's release since they were detained on March 27 and sent to the Karnes County Detention Facility in Texas.\n\n\"After eleven days of uncertainty, our students and their mother are returning home,\" Gaffney said in a statement Monday. \"We remain committed to providing the care, understanding, and sensitivity necessary for all students and staff as we begin the healing process from this traumatic experience.\"\n\nA senior official in the Department of Homeland Security confirmed to NBC News that the family is set to return home.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement Monday afternoon that she spoke with Homan, who confirmed to her that the family is \"currently on their way back\" to Sackets Harbor in Jefferson County.\n\n\"I cannot imagine the trauma these kids and their mom are feeling, and I pray they will be able to heal when they return home,\" Hochul said.\n\nCorey DeCillis, chairman of the Jefferson County Democratic Committee, who organized a demonstration Saturday demanding the family's release, told NBC News he was \"elated.\"\n\nAccording to the senior DHS official, agents with Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol were executing a criminal search warrant at Old McDonald’s Farm in Sackets Harbor on March 27 in relation to an ongoing federal investigation into the possession and distribution of child sexual abuse materials.\n\nThe DHS official said authorities arrested seven people who were undocumented, including the mother and her three children, while at the farm. The official did not specify how authorities encountered the people arrested.\n\n\"Homeland Security Investigations immediately conducted an investigation to ensure these children were not being sexually exploited,\" the official added.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates, school officials and Hochul pushed back, questioning why arresting them and “disappearing them” from their community ensured the children’s safety.\n\nMurad Awawdeh, president and chief executive officer of the New York Immigration Coalition, said in an interview with NBC News on Monday that what happened to the Sackets Harbor family was “a very grueling and horrifying experience.”\n\nIn an open letter last week, Jaime Cook, principal of Sackets Harbor Central School, said the family \"lived in a house on the same road as a home ICE had a warrant for. The fact that ICE went door to door is unfathomable.\"\n\n\"The fact that our students were handcuffed and put into the same van as the alleged criminal from down the street is unconscionable,\" Cook's letter read.\n\nHochul said Tuesday she “cannot think of any public safety justification for ICE agents to rip an innocent family, including a child in the third grade, from their Sackets Harbor home.”\n\nCook said the children are in the third, 10th and 11th grades and had been at the school for three years.\n\nThe mother and her three children were taken when immigration authorities were searching the Old McDonald's Farm for a South African immigrant, who has since been charged with distribution of child pornography.\n\nThe South African immigrant's arrest was part of an \"enhanced targeted operation\" from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in western, central and northern New York from March 24 to 28.\n\nHoman had defended the operation and the family's arrest in an interview with WWNY-TV of Watertown last week.\n\n\"ICE is doing everything by the book. Once the investigation gets to the point where we don’t have an interest in this family, then a decision will be made on release,\" Homan said.\n\nCook said the family had long been part of the Sackets Harbor community, working at the farm for 15 years. She said that from showing up to their court hearings to declaring themselves to immigration judges, the mother and children had also been \"doing everything right\" to find a path to remain in the U.S. legally.\n\nAwawdeh said he hopes the family can effectively resume these efforts.\n\nAs the community awaits the family's return, Awawdeh said they are \"a testament to how community support can really make a difference in helping secure the release of your neighbor.\"",

    "title": "Family fears for safety of Venezuelan makeup artist deported to Salvadoran megaprison",
    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "Growing up in Venezuela, Andry Hernandez Romero discovered an early love for theater, costume design and makeup by participating in his small town’s annual festival for Three Kings Day.\n\n“He would design and sew his own costumes, and he would do the makeup for all the women in the parade,” said Reina Cardenas, Hernandez’s close childhood friend.\n\nLater, as he pursued a career as a makeup artist, Hernandez had a crown tattooed on each of his wrists. His family says the tattoos were a symbol of his beloved Three Kings festival.\n\nBut they are also, according to U.S. government records, what landed him on a plane full of Venezuelan men the Trump administration deported to a megaprison in El Salvador.\n\nThose deportations, carried out without court hearings under the Alien Enemies Act, are now the subject of a heated legal battle that has reached the Supreme Court — and which some say has brought the country to the brink of a constitutional crisis.\n\nFor Hernandez’s family, the deportations are a source of constant anguish. They have had no contact with Hernandez since March 14, the last time they spoke to him on the phone from an immigration detention facility in the United States.\n\n“I think about him every day; I cry about him every day,” said his mother, Dolores Alexis Romero de Hernandez. “What are they doing to him, how are they treating him? Is he in there with bad people?”\n\nHernandez is from Capacho, a town in western Venezuela with a century-old tradition of staging an elaborate festival with parades and theatrical performances on Three Kings Day, a Christian holiday in January. Hernandez met many of his childhood friends, including Cardenas, through their participation in the festival — but he was more enthusiastic about participating than most.\n\n“Andry dedicated his life to arts and culture, and he worked hard to better his craft,” Cardenas said.\n\nAndry Hernandez Romero. Family photo\n\nLater, Hernandez moved to Caracas for a job as a makeup artist for a state-run TV station. There, he told his family and his lawyers, he experienced humiliating and discriminatory treatment for his sexual orientation (Hernandez is gay) and for his opposition to Venezuela’s authoritarian government.\n\nIn May, Hernandez set off for the United States.\n\nHe crossed the border at a legal port of entry with an appointment under then-President Joe Biden’s CBP One program. Then, he asked for asylum.\n\nHowever, because of his tattoos, he stayed in detention during the months he spent in the United States. Court records filed by his attorneys show that immigration officers took photos of all of his tattoos: a snake, roses, flowers and a butterfly.\n\nBut it was the crowns on his wrist that, according to the records, caused officers to associate him with an infamous Venezuelan gang.\n\n“The crown has been found to be an identifier for a Tren de Aragua gang member,” an officer wrote.\n\nExperts who study Tren de Aragua say the gang, unlike other criminal groups, does not use tattoos as markers of membership.\n\n“It’s not like the Central American maras” — such as MS-13, which started in Los Angeles but spread to Central America after members were deported there — “or the Latin Kings, where in some cases you need to have a certain tattoo in order to belong to the gang,” said Ronna Rísquez, a Venezuelan investigative journalist and author of a book on Tren de Aragua. “You can have a tattoo and not belong to the gang, or you could not have any tattoos and belong to the gang.”\n\nHernandez’s tattoos were applied by Jose Manuel Mora, a tattoo artist who is a friend from Capacho. “For Andry, they had a special meaning because of the festival in Capacho,” Mora said.\n\nAndry Hernandez Romero. Family photo\n\nBut tattoos of crowns were also extremely popular at the time. “It was the trend,\" Mora said. \"Between 2017 and 2019, I must have done about 60 tattoos of crowns just for people from our small town.”\n\nIn the months Hernandez spent in immigration detention in the United States, he was represented by a pro bono immigration lawyer. When Hernandez did not show up for a hearing in his asylum case, the government informed the lawyer that he had been removed to El Salvador.\n\n“This is unprecedented,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, executive director of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, the organization representing Hernandez. “We have absolutely no access to our client, nor is it clear which court has jurisdiction over him at this moment.”\n\nHernandez’s lawyers are pursuing multiple avenues to get him out of the prison, but they say the principal obstacle to doing so is the Trump administration itself.\n\n“The Trump administration could send a plane to Venezuela, admit their mistake and bring him back safety today,” Toczylowski said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn March, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson posted on X that Hernandez’s “own social media indicates he is a member of Tren de Aragua.” However, she did not cite specific posts, and an NBC News review of Hernandez’s known social media accounts did not find any indications of gang activity.\n\nThe case has drawn criticism of the Trump administration from some unexpected quarters, including podcaster and Trump ally Joe Rogan.\n\n\"That’s horrific,” Rogan said on his podcast, calling Hernandez’s deportation “a horrible mistake.”\n\nHernandez’s loved ones, meanwhile, are left to wonder about his fate.\n\nCardenas worries, in particular, about what kind of treatment he might get because of his sexual orientation.\n\n“That worries us immensely,” she said. “It’s something that keeps me up at night.”",

    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "Trump has sought to upend an entire economic order that revolves around free trade and the U.S. transition to a service-oriented economy from a manufacturing-intensive one.\n\nBaseline 10% tariffs took effect Saturday, with dozens of countries facing higher so-called reciprocal tariffs beginning Wednesday. China said Friday it would impose a 34% tariff on all goods imported from the United States beginning this Thursday, after the U.S. tariffs are set to rise on Chinese goods — from 20% to at least 54%.\n\nTrump didn’t seem to be letting up anytime soon; on Monday he threatened China with an additional 50% tariffs by Wednesday if it didn’t rescind its retaliatory measures. The White House later clarified it would mean 104% total.\n\nTrump said both that the tariffs may be permanent but that they also may be subject to negotiations — further sowing confusion about his plans.\n\n“We’re going to get fair deals and good deals with everybody,” Trump said from the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “And if we don’t, we’re going to have nothing to do with them. They’re not going to be allowed to participate in the United States.”\n\nAnd he continued to say the United States needed to close trade deficits — when countries’ imports exceed their exports — which economists say would mean a massive and potentially impossible reorientation of the U.S. economy.\n\nTrump has tried to portray his strategy as winning. “Virtually every country wants to negotiate,\" he said Monday.\n\nHe said he’d spoken with Japan’s prime minister, who was sending a team to negotiate. He said on Truth Social that \"they have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade. They don’t take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs. Likewise Agriculture, and many other ‘things.’ It all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!”\n\nYet the overwhelming consensus among economists and high-profile business executives has been that the tariffs are a huge mistake. Goldman Sachs analysts likened them to “Pandora’s box,” adding that the U.S. action against China in particular was “substantially higher” than what most investors had expected.\n\nAnd criticism from within Trump’s orbit — rare these days — is growing. Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., have both publicly argued against the tariffs.\n\n“One person can make a mistake, and guess what — tariffs are a terrible mistake,” Paul said last week.\n\nEven Elon Musk chastised White House top trade adviser Peter Navarro for defending the tariffs. Musk, the Tesla CEO and the world’s richest man, shared a video Monday of economist Milton Friedman speaking about the benefits of importing goods and of free trade.\n\nHedge fund investor Bill Ackman, an ardent supporter of Trump’s 2024 campaign, posted on X that if Trump stays his current course, “we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down.”\n\nIn the meantime, at least one banking giant is already forecasting that unemployment is poised to climb from 4.2% to 5.3% and for the economy to contract.\n\nIn an annual letter to shareholders Monday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned the tariffs would likely boost inflation and weigh down an already-slowing economy.\n\n“Whatever you think of the legitimate reasons for the newly announced tariffs — and, of course, there are some — or the long-term effect, good or bad, there are likely to be important short-term effects,” Dimon said. “We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.”\n\nTrump has pointed to falling oil and food prices and declining interest rates while claiming, inaccurately, that “there is NO INFLATION” and calling for the Federal Reserve to cut rates.\n\n“Our past ‘leaders’ are to blame for allowing this, and so much else, to happen to our country,” he wrote.\n\nIn fact, the declines in prices Trump mentioned have largely been a function of weakening economic growth.\n\nWhile there were signs of slower activity as the Biden administration wound down, the uncertain business environment Trump has created has helped to curtail consumer and business sentiment, while overall price growth has continued to linger. As a result of that stubborn inflation, consumer borrowing rates have not changed much — contradicting Trump’s assertion.",

    "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
    "content": "The National Weather Service is no longer providing language translations of its products, a change that experts say could put non-English speakers at risk of missing potentially life-saving warnings about extreme weather.\n\nThe weather service has “paused” the translations because its contract with Lilt, an artificial intelligence company, has lapsed, NWS spokesman Michael Musher said. He declined further comment.\n\nLilt, an artificial intelligence company, began providing translations in late 2023, replacing manual translations that the weather service had said were labor-intensive and not sustainable and eventually. It eventually provided them in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Samoan.\n\nThe contract lapse comes as President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to slash spending in federal agencies, including cuts within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that have led to high employee vacancy rates at NWS offices.\n\nNOAA referred questions about the contract to a message on its website announcing the contract had lapsed. Lilt did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNearly 68 million people in the U.S. speak a language other than English at home, including 42 million Spanish speakers, according to 2019 Census data.\n\nNot being able to read urgent weather alerts could be a matter of life or death, said Joseph Trujillo-Falcón, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who has worked with NOAA researching how to translate weather and climate information to the public, including the use of artificial intelligence.\n\nHe said translated weather alerts saved lives during a deadly tornado outbreak in Kentucky in 2021. A Spanish-speaking family interviewed afterward said they got a tornado alert on their cellphone in English but ignored it because they didn’t understand it, he said. When the same alert came in Spanish, they quickly sought shelter, he said.\n\n“It saved their life,” said Trujillo-Falcón.\n\nTrujillo-Falcón said weather alerts used to be translated by forecasters that spoke more than one language, a task that could be “completely overwhelming” on top of their forecasting duties.\n\nThe translations are important for more than extreme weather events, said Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia Climate School at Columbia University. General weather forecasts are essential for a number of sectors including tourism, transportation and energy. Families and businesses can make more informed decisions when they can get weather information that often includes actions that should be taken based on the forecast.\n\nNorma Mendoza-Denton, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said there are many people in the U.S. that function with limited English relevant to their daily routines. For example, a shopkeeper might be able to have short conversations with customers but might not have the same understanding when it comes to reading weather or climate terminologies.\n\n“If they don’t have access to that National Weather Service information in the different languages, that could be the difference between life and death for somebody,” Mendoza-Denton said.",

    "content": "DENVER — Jury selection began Monday in the trial of a former Gambian soldier accused of torture in his home country, making him the first noncitizen to stand trial in the United States for allegedly committing torture abroad.\n\nMichael Correa, 45, a former soldier in the Gambia military, is charged with six counts of torture and aiding and abetting torture and one count of conspiracy.\n\nHe was once a member of an armed and specialized military unit known as the Junglers, which was part of the Gambia Armed Forces but took direct orders from then-president Yahya Jammeh, according to a federal grand jury indictment.\n\nFrom March to April 2006, Correa and other members in the unit arrested several individuals believed to be plotting to overthrow the Gambia government, the court document said.\n\nCorrea tortured the victims by placing guns in their mouths, striking them with sticks and extinguishing cigarettes on their bodies inside a prison, the court document said.\n\nCorrea “sought to coerce confessions from the victims in order to have them admit to having had a role in the attempt to overthrow the government or to having been politically opposed to president Jammeh,” the documents said.\n\nCorrea is the first non-U.S. citizen to stand trial in U.S. federal court on allegations of torture abroad, said Department of Justice spokesperson Nicole Navas Oxman said.\n\nCorrea's attorneys, Boston Stanton Jr. and Jared Westbroek, could not be reached for comment Monday, and federal prosecutors declined to comment.\n\n“Michael Correa allegedly committed heinous acts of violence against victim after victim in a brutal effort to coerce confessions from suspected coup plotters,” prosecutors said when announcing the charges.\n\nCorrea traveled with Jammeh to the U.S. in 2016 to act as his bodyguard after the president was forced into exile, NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver reported.\n\nBut Correa overstayed his visa and tried to hide in Colorado, the station reported. His last known address was in Denver, the indictment said.\n\nTwelve jurors and two alternates were to be selected with opening arguments expected to begin Tuesday.",

It showed the free-market intellectual Milton Friedman, in a 1980 clip well known to economists, waxing poetic about free trade as he sketched out the international origins of the parts that form a pencil.\n\nMusk was expressing his discomfort with President Trump’s imposition of draconian new tariffs. And yet one has to wonder what Musk hopes to accomplish.\n\nThis is not a president known to brook much public criticism, after all. Try to imagine Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, subtweeting her boss.\n\nAnd Musk repeatedly went out of his way to disagree with Trump over the weekend, suggesting he believes he is not subject to the same rules that govern others in the president’s inner circle.",

    "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
    "content": "Last week, it arrived, for them and nearly 7,000 other plaintiffs who say they were sexually abused as children in Los Angeles County’s juvenile detention and foster care systems, in cases dating to the late 1950s. In a settlement that lawyers say is the largest of its kind in the nation, the county publicly apologized and agreed to pay a record $4 billion, dwarfing previous settlements in child sex abuse cases brought against the Boy Scouts of America and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\n\nThe wave of claims — so immense that officials had warned before the deal that Los Angeles County, the nation’s most populous, could be bankrupted by it — came after California gave childhood victims a new window to sue, even though the statute of limitations had expired. The county’s Board of Supervisors is expected to formally approve the payout on April 29.\n\nSome two dozen states have established similar “lookback windows” in response to a growing understanding of the many reasons child sex abuse victims might not come forward, or even think of themselves as having been abused, until years or decades later.\n\nThe new statutes have prompted thousands of lawsuits and concern about potentially enormous liabilities to taxpayers. Last week, facing a $3 billion budget gap, Maryland lawmakers voted to reduce the maximum possible award there by more than half.\n\nIn some cases, the systems in Los Angeles County that allowed the flagrant abuse of children have already gone through rounds of reforms. The MacLaren Children’s Center in El Monte, Calif., where Ms. Ashbrook and Ms. Bodkin were placed in the 1960s and Mr. Wright lived in the 1990s, closed in 2003 with a backlog of dozens of abuse allegations and a grand jury’s finding that it had hired employees with criminal records.",

Both went to Yale as undergraduates. Both were first appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush. As judges, they overlapped for more than seven years at the E.

He is also a particularly well-respected jurist with deep ties to members of the conservative legal establishment, such as Justice Kavanaugh.",

Israel’s prime minister was expected to personally petition Mr. Trump on Monday in meetings at the White House. Vietnam’s top leader, in a phone call last week, offered to get rid of tariffs on American goods, while Indonesia prepared to send a high-level delegation to Washington, D.C., to “directly negotiate with the U.S. government.”\n\nEven Lesotho, the tiny landlocked country in Southern Africa, was assembling a delegation to send to Washington to protest the tariffs on its exports to the United States, which include denim for Calvin Klein and Levi’s.\n\nMr. Trump and his advisers have given mixed signals on whether the United States is willing to negotiate. On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that the tariffs would remain in place until U.S. trade deficits disappeared, meaning the United States is no longer buying more from these countries than it sells to them. But the administration still appeared to be welcoming offers from foreign nations, which are desperate to try to forestall more levies that go into effect on Wednesday.",

The European Union, while signalling that it would prefer to negotiate, is said to be working to finalize a list of U.S. goods that it would target.\n\nOther economies — even large ones like Japan and South Korea — don’t have the same leverage, and many are offering concessions. Some are offering to lower their own tariff rates as they try to reach an agreement with the Trump administration.\n\nBut it’s unclear how much President Trump wants to negotiate, and a White House trade advisor warned on Monday that even lowering tariffs to zero would not be enough to get the United States to back down.\n\nHow major trade partners are responding",

    "content": "The Trump administration is expected to roll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, including a program to crack down on federally licensed gun dealers who falsify business records and skip customer background checks, according to two people briefed on the move.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, under pressure from gun rights groups, is likely to announce this week that she plans to eliminate the “zero tolerance” policy, put in place four years ago, that strips the federal licenses of firearms dealers found to have repeatedly violated federal laws and regulations, the people said.\n\nMs. Bondi plans to order Kash Patel, who is serving as F.B.I. director and the interim leader of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to review two other major policies enacted under the Biden administration, with an eye toward scrapping both. One is a ban on so-called pistol braces used to convert handguns into rifle-like weapons, and the second is a rule requiring background checks on private gun sales.\n\nThe moves come at a moment of chaos at a largely leaderless and rudderless A.T.F., whose small work force has been partly redeployed to provide support for immigration raids around the country. Mr. Patel has spent most of his time running the F.B.I., and the Justice Department has proposed merging the gun agency with the Drug Enforcement Administration, a plan that has left the A.T.F.’s career leadership demoralized. That, however, is unlikely to take place anytime soon.",

The index is on the precipice of a bear market — a rare marker of extreme market pessimism when stocks fall 20 percent from their peak.\n\nThe overarching concern for investors hasn’t changed. They are worried that steep tariffs imposed by the United States on huge swaths of imports, and the tit-for-tat response from China and other countries, will sink global growth and fuel inflation. Analysts noted that the cause of Monday’s brief rally — a false report that President Trump is considering delaying the new tariffs — showed just how desperate investors are for any sign that the White House is hearing their concerns.",

    "content": "In the summer of 1993, the movie “Free Willy” — about a captive killer whale that’s heroically set free — was an unexpected hit. But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\n\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\n\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.",

They said that such offenses did not ordinarily rise to deportation.\n\nWithout a visa an international student becomes undocumented, and must leave the United States or risk being detained and placed in deportation proceedings. Several attorneys said that they had clients who had opted to leave the country out of fear that they could be arrested by agents from ICE, the Homeland Security agency charged with carrying out Mr. Trump’s pledge of mass deportations.\n\nSome of the affected students are graduate students who have doctoral dissertations that they are supposed to defend next month. Others are undergraduates. Still others have completed their studies and have been working in the United States, under a special program that allows recent international graduates to remain in the country for up to three years if employed.\n\n“This is totally unprecedented,” said Fuji Whittenburg, an immigration lawyer in Calabasas, Calif., who has been practicing law for 20 years. “I have never seen anything close to this.”\n\nShe added, “A brush with law enforcement that didn’t necessarily result in an arrest or a conviction is all it took.”",

    "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
    "content": "Raised in New York City by first-generation Americans who she said were members of the Communist Party, Dr. Nestle became the first in her family to attend college when she received a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied biology. She was often the only woman in her lab sections, and recalls her male peers depositing dead lab rats near her equipment.\n\nUndeterred, she completed a Ph.D. in molecular biology and landed a job at Brandeis University. There, in 1975, Dr. Nestle was asked to teach a new course on nutrition, added by student petition; the department had no offerings on the subject, and interest in it was increasing in society. “Preparing for that class was like falling in love,” she said. She had a passion for food and cooking and was excited by the challenges that came with understanding how people ate — and how they should eat. She would go on to teach nutrition for decades.\n\nIn 1986, Dr. Nestle joined the Department of Health and Human Services as senior nutrition policy adviser. There she edited the first Surgeon General’s Report on Nutrition and Health, released in 1988, before joining New York University as the chair of the school’s neglected and fusty Department of Home Economics and Nutrition. In time, she transformed it into the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies, focused on the intersections of food, culture, sociology and politics. It was among the first of what would become many food studies programs at universities around the country.\n\n“That program has had an enormous influence on getting food taken seriously as an academic subject,” Mr. Pollan said, “not just nutrition, but food and the food system and food politics.”\n\nAt the time, the field of nutrition was focused on educating people to make healthier choices, which presupposed that one’s food decisions were a matter of personal responsibility. But while working on the surgeon general’s report, Dr. Nestle witnessed the power food companies wielded; although the report cited overconsumption of saturated fats as a leading cause of death, Dr. Nestle was not permitted to recommend eating less meat, a top source of the fats, because of the Reagan administration’s unwillingness to upset the meat industry. (Dr. Nestle is fond of saying, “Anytime you advocate to eat less of something, it’s bad for business.”) She realized that food producers’ lobbying determined where agricultural subsidies were spent (and therefore which foods were most affordable) and even what the federal government was willing to say about what its citizens should and should not eat.",

    "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
    "content": "Republicans have long asserted that proxy voting — when lawmakers who are not at the Capitol can designate a colleague to cast a vote on their behalf — is unconstitutional and destroys the fabric of the institution of Congress, which requires lawmakers to convene in person.\n\n“If you aren’t capable of doing the job your constituents sent you to do, then you should step aside and let someone else do it,” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, said last week as she argued against any form of proxy voting.\n\nThe maneuver that Mr. Johnson proposed, which has been used in the Senate for more than a century, allows an absent member to form a “live pair” with a lawmaker who is present and had planned to take the opposing position on a bill. The member who is in the chamber agrees to vote “present,” thus canceling out the vote of the absent one, and announces for the record how the absent member would have voted.\n\nThe arrangement is unlikely to give absent mothers much opportunity to influence what happens in the House. Because the practice is fully voluntary, it would be unlikely to occur on any legislation whose fate was truly in doubt. On a bill where the speaker could not afford to lose a vote on his side, it would be exceedingly difficult to find a member of either party willing to pair with a colleague who held the opposite position.\n\nRepresentative Anna Paulina Luna, the Florida Republican who has been agitating for over a year for proxy voting for new parents, tried to claim a small victory even as she appeared to cave on her animating issue.",

But if funded, the maximum value would represent more than a sixfold increase in spending to detain immigrants. It is the latest indication that President Trump and his administration are laying the groundwork to rapidly follow through on his promise for a mass campaign to rid the country of undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe sprawling request to contractors was posted last week with a deadline of Monday. In the last fiscal year, D.H.S. allocated about $3.4 billion for the entire custody operation overseen by ICE.",

Janet Mills, a Democrat, at the White House in February. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to punish the state if it does not comply with his executive order banning transgender women from women’s sports.\n\nThe federal government maintains that a Maine law prohibiting discrimination against transgender people, and the state’s policy of allowing transgender athletes to play on women’s teams, are violations of Title IX, the civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in education.\n\n“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, wrote in a letter to Ms. Mills last week, according to the lawsuit. “This is only the beginning, though you are free to end it at any time by protecting women and girls in compliance with federal law.”",

It also found that wastewater was left to run into the forest.\n\nView image in fullscreen Guests at Stedsans, which has now shut, were promised an idyllic rural stay. Photograph: Stedsans/Instagram\n\nStaff said multiple animals – including ducks – had died as a result of being left outside through the night by the couple, and others were left abandoned after the owners vanished.\n\nStedsans was declared bankrupt in March and the couple reportedly registered themselves as living abroad before Christmas.\n\nAccording to the investigation, they left the Danish capital, where they owed millions of kroner in debt to Danish tax authorities, in 2016 to move to Sweden. There they set up Stedsans, but started accumulating debt to Swedish tax authorities, which reportedly amounted to 6m SEK (£470,000). They have since started a new hotel business in Guatemala.\n\nIn a message posted on their website, they said: “We came very far with Stedsans, but we also had to realise on the way that being soul-driven entrepreneurs on a mission in a country where taxes are some of the highest in the world and bureaucracy is relentless, it is an impossible task.”\n\nThey added: “When you read this we have probably been declared bankrupt by the Swedish tax authorities.

    "content": "Madonna has said she has “buried the hatchet” with Sir Elton John and hinted she will collaborate with him, after watching the pianist and singer perform with Brandi Carlile on Saturday Night Live (SNL).\n\nThe strained relationship dates back to 2002, when John was quoted by CBS News as describing her theme to Die Another Day as “the worst Bond tune ever”.\n\nHe went on to say “Madonna, best live act? Fuck off” on stage at the Q Awards in 2004, and accused her of lip-syncing.\n\nThe pair have traded a number of remarks since, but in a post on Instagram on Monday, Madonna, whose full name is Madonna Ciccone, said: “We finally buried the hatchet.”\n\nThe singer said John’s recent appearance on SNL reminded her of when she snuck out of her home while at high school to see him perform in Detroit, which she described as an “unforgettable” performance that changed the course of her life.\n\nShe said: “I had always felt like an outsider growing up and watching him on stage helped me to understand that it was OK to be different, to stand out, to take the road less travelled. In fact, it was essential.\n\n“Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist. I didn’t understand it. I was told Elton John was the musical guest on SNL and I decided to go.”\n\nMadonna said that she confronted John backstage, where he asked her to forgive him. She said the pair then hugged and the pianist told her he had written a song for her and wanted to collaborate.\n\nJohn and Carlile performed Little Richard’s Bible on SNL from their collaborative album Who Believes In Angels?, which is on course to become the Briton’s 10th UK No 1 album.\n\nIn response to Madonna, John thanked her for coming to see him on SNL and for forgiving his “big mouth”.\n\nHe wrote on Instagram that he was not proud of what he had said, praising her advocacy for HIV/Aids in the 1980s and her “groundbreaking work” that paved the way for an entire generation of female artists.\n\nHe said: “I’m grateful we can move forward. I’m increasingly distressed by all the divisiveness in our world at the moment.”\n\nJohn said he and Madonna had been wholeheartedly accepted and embraced by communities who are under threat around the world, and that he hoped to make “great things happen” together for those who needed support.",

    "content": "From 36m ago 21.56 EDT China vows to fight Trump tariffs 'to the end' China’s commerce ministry has vowed to fight US tariffs “to the end” after Donald Trump threatened fresh levies of 50% on imports from the world’s second-largest economy. “The US threat to escalate tariffs against China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which once again exposes the US’s blackmailing nature,” a ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday. “China will never accept this,” AFP quoted them as saying. If the US insists on going its own way, China will fight it to the end. If the US escalates its tariff measures, China will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests. Trump upended the world economy last week with sweeping tariffs that have raised fears of an international recession and triggered criticism even from within his own Republican Party. As the trade war escalates, Beijing – Washington’s major economic rival – unveiled its own 34% duties on US goods to come into effect on Thursday.

Tuesday’s announcements by China Chengtong Holdings Group and China Reform Holdings Corp came after Chinese state fund Central Huijin said on Monday it would increase share holdings to foster stability in markets, Reuters reports. China’s stock benchmark dived 7% on Monday amid investor worries about the risk of a damaging trade war and a global recession. Washington last week imposed extra tariffs of 34% on China, which then fired back with its own 34% levies on US imports, prompting Donald Trump to threaten an additional 50% tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing did not retract the countermeasure. Chengtong said its investment units would increase holdings in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) to safeguard market stability. “We are firmly optimistic toward the growth prospects of China’s capital markets,” the state investment firm said in a statement, vowing to support high-quality growth of Chinese listed companies. China Reform Holdings Corp, also known as Guoxin, said in a separate statement that an investment unit would increase holdings in tech companies, state firms and ETFs, tapping a relending scheme for share buybacks. Initial investment will be 80bn yuan ($10.95bn). Another state holding company, China Electronics Technology Group, said it would boost share buybacks in listed units to bolster investor confidence.

    "title": "Alarm as Republicans in Congress back Trump and Musk’s attacks on US judges",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "As Donald Trump and Elon Musk widen their radical attacks on US judges who have stalled some of Trump’s executive orders and Musk’s slashing of federal agencies, they’re gaining backing from top House Republicans and other politicians, including some to whom the tech billionaire made big campaign donations.\n\nThe House speaker, Mike Johnson, and judiciary panel chairman Jim Jordan have echoed some of Trump’s attacks on judges, and a judiciary subcommittee hearing on 1 April explored “judicial overreach” and ways to curb judges who have stymied some Trump orders or Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and its draconian cuts to the federal government.\n\nVeteran Republican consultants say the hefty campaign-spending muscle of Musk, the world’s richest person, who spent about $300m helping Trump win last year, is likely to boost many Republican candidates in 2026 races, increasing pressures on members from Trump and Musk to accelerate efforts to rein in dissident judges.\n\n“Republicans on Capitol Hill expect Musk to make a lot of donations to them in 2026,” said longtime Republican consultant Charlie Black. “But it’s likely that such donations will be coordinated with the president’s preferences.”\n\nThe verbal assaults on judges by Trump and his allies have been fueled by multiple rulings adverse to some Trump executive orders, including major court decisions in March that sought to halt deporting Venezuelan immigrants and blocking penalizing law firms that Trump deemed political enemies.\n\nWashington DC judge James Boasberg incurred Trump’s wrath for trying to halt the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to an El Salvador prison with a nationwide injunction challenging the tenuous legal basis for the administration action. Boasberg’s ruling spurred Trump to falsely label him a “radical left lunatic”, urge his impeachment, and then call for him to be disbarred.\n\nMusk has repeatedly used X, the social media platform he owns and on which he has over 200 million followers, to urge impeaching judges whose rulings he doesn’t like. “The only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges,” he said on 25 February.\n\nLegal scholars say Trump and Musk’s radical threats of impeachment or disbarment for judicial rulings that stall or block administration moves undermine the rule of law.\n\n“Trump and Musk are playing with fire,” said retired Massachusetts judge Nancy Gertner, who is now a lecturer at Harvard Law School. “They’re undermining bedrock constitutional principles.”\n\nShe added: “You can’t shut down a court just because you disagree. The judges have done nothing wrong or inconsistent with their oaths, and nothing outside their judicial roles.”\n\nTrump’s call for impeaching Boasberg drew a sharp and broad rebuke from supreme court chief justice John Roberts, who last month said that “for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision”.\n\nFurther, contrary to Trump’s baseless charges against Boasberg, the judge’s rulings have hardly been one-sided. One example: Boasberg sided with Trump in 2017 to stop the IRS from sharing his tax returns which a long-shot lawsuit sought.\n\nBesides Boasberg, three other Washington DC judges last month ruled against Trump executive orders targeting law firms he viewed as political foes for retribution, which the judges argued were on dangerous or dubious legal ground.\n\nAmong other things, the Trump orders seek to take away security clearances for some of the law firms and sharply curtail their government business.\n\nTo ratchet up pressures on judges, after judge Beryl Howell issued a decision in March to temporarily block Trump from penalizing the law firm Perkins Coie, the justice department, in a rare move, tried to have Howell removed from the case, alleging she was biased.\n\nIn a blistering response, Howell wrote: “This strategy is designed to impugn the integrity of the federal judicial system and blame any loss on the decision-maker rather than fallacies in the substantive legal arguments presented.”\n\nTwo other DC judges in March backed law firms Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, which sued the administration on first amendment grounds to block executive orders aimed at hurting the firms financially for their separate ties to key lawyers who led a special counsel inquiry into how Russia worked to help elect Trump in 2016.\n\nJudge John Bates, an appointee of George W Bush who issued a restraining order blocking Trump’s sanctions against Jenner & Block, called Trump’s punitive move “disturbing” and “troubling”, noting the order targets the firm’s and its lawyers’ rights under the first amendment, and due process.\n\nLegal scholars and former judges are raising alarms about the rising dangers to the rule of law and the physical safety of judges sparked by the attacks from Trump and his congressional allies.\n\n“While the threats to impeach federal judges based on their decisions are largely performative, they are also designed to foment disrespect for the judiciary and the rule of law,” said former federal judge John Jones, who is now the president of Dickinson College.\n\n“In addition, many of the calls for impeachment are accompanied by the unconscionable disclosure of personal information about individual judges that jeopardize the personal safety of those judges and their family members.”\n\nOther legal experts worry that Trump’s judicial attacks, which some congressional allies are parroting even though the odds of impeaching judges are long, could spark violence.\n\n“The real risk comes not from Congress, but the fringe elements in Trump’s camp, who might be stirred up to threaten or actually inflict harm on the targeted judges,” said former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One option eyed by Trump’s Republican allies came up at a judiciary subcommittee hearing last week that focused on banning nationwide injunctions by judges. A House bill to ban such injunctions is expected to pass in coming weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Charles Grassley, the senator who leads his chamber’s judiciary committee and has received a donation from Musk, held a hearing that also explored bans on nationwide injunctions by judges; Grassley in March introduced a bill that would end the “practice of universal injunctions”, but Senate passage is deemed a long shot.\n\nSome former Republican congressmen are highly critical of Trump’s congressional allies for amplifying his attacks on judges, and predict that the House GOP will try to “monetize” Trump’s fury at a growing number of judges.\n\n“The investigation into judges by Chairman Jordan, and calls by Gill and Ogles for the impeachment of judges who have ruled against Trump, are more examples of blind loyalty to Trump by a bunch of sycophants,” said former Michigan member Dave Trott.\n\n“It would not be such a big deal except for the fact that their conduct is helping create a crisis involving the constitution they swore to uphold.”\n\nTrott added: “And just in case these sycophants suddenly decide to stand up to Trump, Elon is using his billions to help Republicans get re-elected. This will ensure the GOP stays in line. The concentration of great wealth and power is a problem that will have serious consequences for our country.”\n\nOther ex-Republican members voice similar concerns.\n\n“I think this is a talking point and a fundraising tool,’ said Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, adding that members will attack judges for “impeding Trump’s agenda, and they’ll try to monetize it for campaign purposes”.\n\nSome former prosecutors say the judicial attacks by Trump and his GOP allies jibe with Trump’s broader blitz to expand his powers\n\n“Trump has, believe it or not, a strategic plan to disable all opposition,” said former prosecutor Paul Rosenzweig.\n\nPart of that plan “involves eliminating internal oversight, like inspectors general, and cowing external opposition, by threatening law firms. The final piece is to eliminate the last independent check on his authority – judges. To do this he is falsely accusing them of bias and enlisting his sycophantic supporters, like Mike Johnson and Jim Jordan, in the effort.”",

    "title": "Rightwing group backed by Koch and Leo sues to stop Trump tariffs",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "A libertarian group that has been funded by Leonard Leo and Charles Koch has mounted a legal challenge against Donald Trump’s tariff regime, in a sign of spreading rightwing opposition to a policy that has sent international markets plummeting.\n\nThe New Civil Liberties Alliance filed a suit against Trump’s imposition of import tariffs on exports from China, arguing that doing so under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) – which the president has invoked to justify the duties on nearly all countries – is unlawful.\n\nThe group’s actions echo support given by four Republican senators last week for a Democratic amendment calling for the reversal of 25% tariffs imposed on Canada.\n\nLast Wednesday’s amendment passed with the support of Mitch McConnell, the former Republican Senate majority leader, and his fellow GOP members Rand Paul, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who argued that tariffs on Canada would be economically harmful.\n\nThe action from the alliance has the potential to be even more emblematic, given its past backing from Koch, a billionaire industrialist, and Leo, a wealthy legal activist who advised Trump on the nomination of three conservative supreme court justices during his first presidency, which has given the court a 6-3 rightwing majority. The group received money from organisations affiliated with Leo and Koch in 2022. A spokesperson for Stand Together, a group partially-funded by Koch and that has supported the alliance, said it was not involved in the legal case.\n\nThe alliance has tabled its action on behalf of Simplified, a Florida-based home goods company whose business is heavily reliant on imports from China. It argues that the president has exceeded his powers in invoking the IEEPA to justify tariffs.\n\n“This statute authorizes specific emergency actions like imposing sanctions or freezing assets to protect the United States from foreign threats,” the alliance said in a statement. “It does not authorize the president to impose tariffs. In its nearly 50-year history, no other president – including President Trump in his first term – has ever tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs.”\n\nThe alliance also argues that power to impose tariffs lies not with a sitting president, but with Congress, and warns that those imposed by Trump could run afoul of US supreme court rulings.\n\n“His attempt to use the IEEPA this way not only violates the law as written, but it also invites application of the supreme court’s major questions doctrine, which tells courts not to discern policies of ‘vast economic and political significance’ in a law without explicit congressional authorization,” its statement said.\n\nMark Chenoweth, the alliance’s president, said the court in Pensacola – where the suit has been filed – would have to observe this legal precedent.\n\n“Reading this law [IEEPA] broadly enough to uphold the China tariff would transfer core legislative power,” he said. “To avoid that non-delegation pitfall, the court must construe the statute consistent with nearly 50 years of unbroken practice and decide it does not permit tariff setting.”\n\nThe suit argues that there is no connection between the fentanyl epidemic – which Trump has cited as a reason for invoking the emergency powers – and the tariffs.\n\n“The means of an across-the-board tariff does not fit the end of stopping an influx of opioids, and is in no sense ‘necessary’ to that stated purpose,” the complaint filed on behalf of Simplified argues.\n\n“In fact, President Trump’s own statements reveal the real reason for the China tariff, which is to reduce American trade deficits while raising federal revenue.”\n\nThe legal case adds to rumbling disquiet on tariffs among some of Trump’s usually vocal supporters, including the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.\n\nPaul, a senator from Kentucky who has been one of the most consistent congressional anti-tariff voices, told the Washington Post that other Capitol Hill Republicans shared his concern.\n\n“They all see the stock market, and they’re all worried about it,” Paul said. “But they are putting on a stiff upper lip to try to act as if nothing’s happening and hoping it goes away.”\n\nSpeaking in support of last week’s Democratic amendment, sponsored by the Virginia senator Tim Kaine, Paul said: “I don’t care if the president is a Republican or a Democrat. I don’t want to live under emergency rule. I don’t want to live where my representatives cannot speak for me and have a check and balance on power.”\n\nTrump attacked Paul and the three other Republican senators who backed the amendment and suggested they were driven by “Trump derangement syndrome”.\n\nIn another sign of Republican concern, the GOP senator from Iowa Chuck Grassley – along with a Washington Democrat, Maria Cantrell – introduced a bill that would limit Trump’s ability to impose or increase tariffs by requiring Congress to approve them within 60 days. The White House budget office said on Monday that Trump would veto the bill.",

    "title": "Netanyahu discusses Gaza and tariffs with Trump at White House meeting",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, met with Donald Trump on Monday for the second time since the US president’s return to office, marking the first effort by a foreign leader to negotiate a deal after Trump announced sweeping tariffs last week.\n\nSpeaking alongside Trump in the Oval Office, Netanyahu said Israel would eliminate the trade deficit with the US. “We intend to do it very quickly,” he told reporters, adding that he believed Israel could “serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same”.\n\nTrump said the pair had a “great discussion” but did not indicate whether he would reduce the tariffs on Israeli goods. “Maybe not,” he said. “Don’t forget we help Israel a lot. We give Israel $4bn a year. That’s a lot.”\n\nTrump denied reports that he was considering a 90-day pause on his tariff rollout. “We’re not looking at that,” he told reporters. “We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals.”\n\nTrump also announced that the US and Iran were beginning talks on Tehran’s nuclear program. “We’re having direct talks with Iran, and they’ve started. It’ll go on Saturday. We have a very big meeting, and we’ll see what can happen,” he told reporters. He warned Tehran would be “in great danger” if the talks collapse.\n\nNetanyahu expressed a cautious support for US-Iran talks but insisted Tehran must not have nuclear weapons. “If it can be done diplomatically … I think that would be a good thing,” he said. “But whatever happens, we must make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons.”\n\nThe comments came in the Oval Office after Trump and Netanyahu held private talks. The White House canceled a joint press conference that was scheduled to take place afterward, without offering an immediate explanation.\n\nNetanyahu, announcing the last-minute meeting on Sunday, said he was visiting at the invitation of Trump to speak about efforts to release Israeli hostages from Gaza, as well as new US tariffs.\n\nThe meeting came after the Trump administration announced his trade war last Wednesday with tariffs on the US’s trading partners, including a 17% tariff on Israeli goods.\n\nThe US is Israel’s closest ally and largest single trading partner. Israel had hoped to avoid the new tariffs by moving to cancel its remaining tariffs on US imports a day before Trump’s announcement.\n\nBefore his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu met with the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff. He also met with the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the US trade representative Jamieson Greer on Sunday night in Washington. The Israeli government described the latter meeting as “warm, friendly and productive”.\n\nDuring Netanyahu’s last visit in February, Trump shocked the world by proposing to take over the Gaza Strip, removing more than 2 million Palestinians and redeveloping the occupied territory as a “Riviera of the Middle East”, in effect endorsing the ethnic cleansing of the people of Gaza.\n\nSince then, Israel has resumed its bombardment in Gaza, collapsing nearly two months of ceasefire with Hamas that had been brokered by the US, Egypt and Qatar.\n\nNearly 1,400 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed Israeli operations in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, taking the total death toll since the start of the war to more than 50,000. Israel has also halted all supplies of food, fuel and humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu’s visit to the US comes as he faces pressure at home to return to ceasefire negotiations and secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu told reporters on Monday that he and Trump had discussed the US leader’s “bold” vision to move Palestinians from Gaza, and that he is working with the US on another deal to secure the release of additional hostages. “We’re working now on another deal, that we hope will succeed,” he said.\n\nNetanyahu also claimed that Israel is committed to “enabling the people of Gaza to freely make a choice to go wherever they want”. Last week, he said Israel was “seizing territory” and intended to “divide up” the Gaza Strip by building a new security corridor, inflaming fears that Israel intends to take permanent control of the strip when the war ends.\n\nNetanyahu arrived in Washington on Sunday night from Hungary, after a four-day official visit that marked the Israeli leader’s first visit to European soil since the international criminal court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him over allegations of war crimes in Gaza.\n\nHungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, made it clear he would defy the court to host Netanyahu, and announced that he would take Hungary out of the ICC because it had become “political”. The US is not a member of the court.",

    "content": "It was reported that the US deported 17 more individuals accused of gang membership to El Salvador without providing names or identifying information, continuing a practice of deporting people for imprisonment abroad without due process.\n\nThe White House announced a review of $9bn in federal contracts and grants at Harvard University over allegations of insufficient action on campus antisemitism.\n\nThe system processes salaries for approximately 276,000 federal employees across various agencies. Senior staff at the interior department reportedly issued a memo warning about the “unusual nature of the request” and the “associated risks” of granting such access.\n\nIt emerged that members of Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) had gained access to the Federal Personnel and Payroll System, raising significant cybersecurity concerns from senior government officials.\n\nThe Trump administration began implementing a controversial plan to reduce the workforce at the Department of Health and Human Services, with “thousands” of employees dismissed.\n\nThe Democrat Cory Booker delivered the longest speech ever by a lone senator, lasting 25 hours and five minutes, staring his intention to “disrupt the normal business of the United States Senate” to draw attention to a “nation in crisis”.\n\nRepublicans retained two House of Representatives seats in Florida vacated by cabinet appointees – but by significantly smaller margins than in the November elections.\n\nThe election was the most expensive judicial contest in US history. Democrats successfully framed it as a referendum on the popularity and influence of both Trump and his close adviser Musk, who spent $25m to support Schimel.\n\nTrump suffered his first major electoral setback as president when the judge Susan Crawford, a liberal candidate, won the Wisconsin state supreme court race , defeating the conservative Brad Schimel. This victory maintained a 4-3 liberal ideological majority on the highest court of a crucial swing state.\n\nThe national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and his team are using encrypted messaging app Signal extensively, it emerged, with “at least 20 different group chats ... to coordinate sensitive national security work”.\n\nReports suggested that Elon Musk’s time in his government role was nearing its end due to a legal limit on his service. Insiders told the Politico website that Musk would leave when the 130-day cap on government service expires.\n\nTrump called the announcement “our declaration of economic independence”, and claimed that “jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country”. He added: “For years, hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now it’s our turn to prosper.”\n\nAt a Rose Garden event flanked by US flags, his cabinet and union workers, the president declared that the US would impose a baseline 10% rate on all imports starting 5 April as well as much higher “reciprocal” rates for dozens of countries that would come into effect on 9 April.\n\nIt emerged the Pentagon’s internal watchdog is launching an investigation into the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth’s use of the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss sensitive military information regarding operations in Yemen.\n\nTrump fired six national security council staffers after a meeting in the Oval Office in which the far-right activist Laura Loomer presented “opposition research” alleging their disloyalty.\n\nTraders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell in New York City, on 3 April.\n\nThe financial impact was substantial, with an estimated $2.5trn wiped off Wall Street alone. But Trump told reporters: “I think it’s going very well … We’ve never seen anything like it. The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.”\n\nTrump’s latest tariff announcement triggered a significant downturn in global financial markets. US markets experienced their worst single-day losses in nearly five years, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closing sharply lower. This marked the most significant drop since the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic in June 2020.\n\nTrump announced another extension to the deadline for the ban or sale of TikTok, pushing it back by 75 days. This delay reportedly occurred after China put a potential deal on hold following the announcement of the sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe US economy added 228,000 jobs in March , and the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.2%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, said he expected the tariffs to hike prices and slow economic growth while indicating the central bank would wait to make any changes to monetary policy as it seeks more clarity. “We face a highly uncertain outlook with elevated risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation,” he told reporters.\n\nDisruption to global financial markets continued in the wake of Trump’s sweeping tariffs. But the president showed no signs of backing down, writing on his Truth Social platform: “TO THE MANY INVESTORS COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES AND INVESTING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY, MY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE.”\n\nThe Trump administration apologized for accidentally informing some Ukrainian refugees fleeing their country’s invasion by Russia that they needed to leave the US because their legal status was being revoked.\n\nThe Trump administration, through the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced the revocation of all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and a block on new arrivals due to the country’s failure to repatriate its citizens expelled from the US.\n\nProtesters gather on the National Mall in Washington DC for the ‘Hands-Off’ protest.\n\nThe protests were organized by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labour unions, LGBTQ+ advocates, military veterans and election activists. Anger with Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk was expressed in a sea of placards and banners on the National Mall in Washington.\n\nThe biggest day of protest so far against the second Trump administration. More than 1,000 “Hands Off” demonstrations took place across the US over issues including the firing of thousands of federal workers, the shutting down of entire government agencies, deportation of immigrants, the scaling back of protections for transgender people and cutting funding for health programs.\n\nPam Bondi, the attorney general, poured cold water on the idea of Trump serving a third term as president. She told Fox News Sunday: “I think he’s going to be finished, probably, after this term. We’d have to look at the constitution, and it would be a heavy lift.”\n\nThe Guardian revealed that Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, included a journalist in the Signal group chat about plans for US strikes in Yemen after he mistakenly saved his number months earlier under the contact card for a Trump spokesperson.\n\nBut the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, suggested that the tariffs were a tool to leverage negotiations with other countries. The agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, echoed this: “We’ve got 50 countries that are burning the phone lines into the White House.”\n\nThe US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, insisted the tariffs were “definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks” and there was “no postponing”. He emphasized Trump’s intention to “reset global trade” and asserted that the president had made this “crystal, crystal clear”.\n\nSenior Trump officials appeared on Sunday’s political TV shows with starkly contrasting messages on tariffs that were only likely to deepen global uncertainty and confusion.\n\nHegseth, who shared details of the strike in the chat, remained defiant. “Nobody was texting war plans,” Hegseth told reporters after landing in Hawaii late Monday, “and that’s all I have to say about that.”\n\nThe story immediately exploded and became one of the biggest scandals of Trump’s second term. It prompted immediate scrutiny over whether the administration’s top officials had disclosed classified information, a criminal offense. There were also questions about why they were using Signal, which allows users to autodelete messages, to discuss such sensitive matters, and not official systems for sharing sensitive information.\n\nJeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, published a bombshell story in which he revealed that top administration officials had accidentally included him in a group chat on the encrypted messaging platform Signal in which they discussed and shared details of a US bombing effort in Yemen. The group included top officials in the US government, including the vice-president, JD Vance; the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and the national security adviser, Mike Waltz.\n\nBy Tuesday evening, Waltz was claiming responsibility for the debacle. “A staffer wasn’t responsible. I take full responsibility. I built the group. My job is to make sure everything is coordinated,” he said during an interview on Fox News .\n\nThe officials said no classified information was shared in the chat. Gabbard dodged questions about whether she would have disclosed the information and whether she was using a personal or work cellphone while in that chat. Ratcliffe defended the use of signal and said it was allowed.\n\n“I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information,” Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said during the hearing.\n\nDemocrats on the Senate intelligence committee grilled Waltz; the CIA director, John Ratcliffe; and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, over the Signal chat as the Trump administration sprinted to contain the fallout from the incident. Democrats escalated their calls for Hegseth’s resignation.\n\nThe Trump administration signed a probably unlawful executive order seeking to add a proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form, among other things. Such a chance would likely disenfranchise millions of people. Civil rights groups pledged quick action to challenge the action in court.\n\nFootage emerged on Wednesday of masked Ice agents arresting and detaining a graduate student at Tufts. It was the latest example of the administration targeting students who express support for Palestinian rights. The only public example of Ozturk’s support for Palestinians is a joint op-ed she co-authored in the Tufts student newspaper.\n\nThe White House was still defiant that it had done nothing wrong, but the disclosure escalated pressure on the administration, which insisted that the details weren’t classified.\n\nThe Atlantic published the full tranche of text messages included in the chat with Goldberg. He had initially withheld them out of concern for national security. Publishing the messages offered the public an unfiltered look at the spectacular detail that advisers had been discussing, and offered a powerful rebuttal to the White House, which had been trying to downplay the severity of the information that was shared.\n\nUS district judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to preserve signal messages related to the Yemen exchange.\n\nTrump announced he was pulling the nomination of Elise Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman from upstate New York, to be his ambassador to the UN. Republicans have a narrow majority in the US House and the decision to pull Stefanik’s nomination reflects that they may be skittish about their prospects of winning a special election in her district, which Trump carried by 20 points in November.\n\nJD Vance visited Greenland in an effort to escalate as part of Donald Trump’s interest in acquiring the country. “I think Greenland understands that the United States should own it,” the vice-president said in a press conference on Friday. “And if Denmark and the EU don’t understand it, we have to explain it to them. We need Greenland. Very importantly, for international security, we have to have Greenland.”\n\nPeter Marks, the top vaccine official in the US, was forced out of his job , citing “misinformation and lies” from Robert F Kennedy Jr.\n\nUnderscoring how fractures in the legal community, another firm, Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom reached an agreement with Trump on Friday to avoid having an executive order issue against the firm.\n\nTwo major law firms, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, sued the Trump administration over executive orders that sought to cripple the firms over their employment of Trump’s rivals. Their lawsuits came amid concern that the legal profession wasn’t doing enough to push back against efforts to punish lawyers. By Friday evening, two separate judges had ruled in favor of the firms, blocking key provisions in the executive orders.\n\nThere were protests in front of Tesla showrooms around the world targeted at Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who has led an effort to gut the US federal government. The protests, part of the “ Tesla Takedown ” movement, took place at 200 of the car company’s showrooms around the worldand organizers sought to encourage people to join the movement, not buy a Tesla car, and sell Tesla stock.\n\nTrump mused about running for a third term, something that is prohibited by the US constitution. “Well, there are plans,” Trump said during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. “There are – not plans. There are methods – there are methods which you could do it, as you know.” Trump declined to give details on how he would execute such a plan .\n\nThe White House denied violating a judge’s order blocking the deportation of Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador. Despite the denial, Homan, the US border czar, appeared to contradict this stance by saying: “I don’t care what the judges think.”\n\nTrump announced the immediate termination of Secret Service protection for Biden’s adult children, Hunter and Ashley Biden. In a Truth Social post, Trump said that Hunter “has had Secret Service protection for an extended period of time, all paid for by the United States Taxpayer” and that both he and Ashley would be “taken off the list”.\n\nThe Trump administration removed the former surgeon general Vivek Murthy’s advisory on gun violence as a public health issue from the Department of Health and Human Services website.\n\nKamala Harris watches as Joe Biden signs executive orders after speaking on racial equity in the state dining room of the White House in Washington DC, on 26 January 2021.\n\nTrump claimed on Monday, without providing evidence, that pardons signed by Biden were “void, vacant and of no further force and effect” because they were signed with an autopen rather than by Biden himself. That assertion made on Truth Social targeted pardons given to members of the House January 6 committee, Anthony Fauci, his son Hunter, and others. “In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!” Trump wrote in the post.\n\nTrump fired the two Democratic commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. Bedoya confirmed his firing on social media, writing: “The President just illegally fired me,” and claimed Trump “wants the Ftc to be a lap dog for his golfing buddies”.\n\nThe administration released thousands of pages of files concerning the assassination of John F Kennedy.\n\nA federal judge ruled that Musk and Doge likely violated the constitution by shutting down USAID. The US district judge Theodore Chuang ordered the administration to reverse actions taken to dismantle the agency, including halting terminations and reinstating former employee access to government systems.\n\nThe chief justice, John Roberts, issued a rare public rebuke of Trump after the president demanded the impeachment of the federal judge James Boasberg, who blocked the deportation of Venezuelan alleged gang members.\n\nA group of men walk down to a food court at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, which houses several US federal government offices, in Washington DC, on 18 March 2025.\n\nThe Trump administration acknowledged in court filings that it had fired nearly 25,000 recently hired federal workers and said agencies were working to reinstate all of them after a judge ruled their terminations were likely illegal. Documents submitted to Baltimore’s federal courthouse included statements from officials at 18 agencies, who confirmed the reinstated probationary workers were being placed on administrative leave at least temporarily. The treasury department terminated approximately 7,600 people, the Department of Agriculture about 5,700, and the Department of Health and Human Services more than 3,200, marking the first full accounting of the mass firings carried out by Musk’s Doge.\n\nA New York federal judge denied the Trump administration’s bid to dismiss the legal challenge brought by Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist detained by immigration agents, and ordered the case transferred to New Jersey.\n\nFederal Reserve officials cut their US economic growth forecasts from 2.1% to 1.7% and raised inflation projections to 2.7% for the year as they kept interest rates unchanged amid Trump’s sweeping tariffs policy.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy, left, smiles during a phone call with Donald Trump to discuss options for a ceasefire agreement on 19 March 2025 in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nTrump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy had their first conversation since their blow up in the White House three weeks ago, with the US president describing it as a “very good telephone call”. The Ukrainian leader characterized the discussion as “positive, very substantive and frank”, and confirmed he had agreed to a partial ceasefire that Trump had previously negotiated with Vladimir Putin. The White House said that Trump promised to help with Ukraine’s request for additional air defense batteries, suggesting a potential thaw in relations after their previously contentious face-to-face meeting.\n\nThe labor department announced it would no longer enforce the $17.75 an hour minimum wage for federal contractors established by a Biden administration executive order. The reversal reinstates the $13.30 hourly wage set during the Obama administration and maintained during Trump’s first term. The change affects employees of federal contractors such as janitors and food service workers, with the most significant impact likely in states that adhere to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\n\nThe president justified the move by claiming the department’s budget had more than doubled in recent years without corresponding improvements in national test scores, despite the fact that curriculum decisions and 90% of school funding come from state and local governments.\n\nDonald Trump signs an executive order alongside Linda McMahon to start the elimination of the Department of Education in Washington DC, on 20 March 2025.\n\nTrump signed an executive order instructing the education secretary, Linda McMahon, to begin dismantling the Department of Education, attempting to bypass the congressional approval typically needed to eliminate a federal agency. At a White House signing ceremony, Trump declared his administration would “take all lawful steps to shut down the department” and expressed hope that McMahon would be the last education secretary.\n\nTrump issued a presidential memo revoking security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and other political opponents who are typically extended intelligence briefings as a courtesy. The revocations also apply to former secretary of state Antony Blinken, former representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, New York attorney general Letitia James, and Biden’s entire family.\n\nColumbia University conceded to a list of demands from the Trump administration as a condition to begin negotiations on restoring $400m in federal funding that was stripped from the university earlier this month. The demands reportedly include banning students from wearing masks at protests, hiring 36 new campus security officers with all-new arrest powers and appointing a new senior vice-provost to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies.\n\nThe comment came after reporting from the New York Times and later the Wall Street Journal indicated that Musk was planning to visit the Pentagon that morning to receive a classified briefing on China. The president confirmed that Musk had indeed visited the Pentagon, but said it was to discuss cost reductions through his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), while Hegseth added that Musk was there “to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations”.\n\nTrump acknowledged on Friday that Elon Musk’s business interests in China created a conflict of interest that would prevent the billionaire from being briefed on potential war plans with the country. “Elon has businesses in China. And he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that,” Trump said, a rare admission considering Musk’s dual role as both a senior presidential adviser and business leader.\n\n“Since ‘Judge’ Reyes is now a top military planner, she/they can report to Fort Benning at 0600 to instruct our Army Rangers on how to execute High Value Target Raids,” Hegseth wrote.\n\nThe defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, joined the Trump administration’s growing criticism of federal judges on Saturday, mocking the US district judge Ana Reyes who had blocked the president’s ban on transgender troops in the military. In a social media post, Hegseth sarcastically referred to the Joe Biden-appointed judge as “Commander Reyes” and suggested she had overstepped her authority by ruling on military matters.\n\nThe secretary of state, Marco Rubio, held a call with Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday “to emphasize US support for Israel”. Among the topics discussed were ongoing military operations in Gaza and a reminder that the US was willing to continue bombing Yemen to target the Houthis over their re-triggered aims at blocking navigation in the Red Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, called the fight against the alleged gang members akin to “modern day warfare” in a Fox News interview.\n\nVenezuelan immigrants walk down a plane upon arrival at Simon Bolivar international airport in Maiquetia, Venezuela, on 20 March 2025.\n\nThe Trump administration defended using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, to deport 137 Venezuelan immigrants last weekend on the grounds that they were allegedly committing violent crimes and sending money back to Venezuela. The US border czar, Tom Homan, said in an interview with ABC News that the administration would not defy court orders stemming from legal challenges. “I don’t care what the judges think as far as this case,” Homan told ABC.\n\nThe justice department’s pardon attorney was dismissed a day after she refused to recommend that the actor Mel Gibson, a prominent Trump supporter, should have his gun rights restored. Elizabeth Oyer said she had been asked to add Gibson’s name to a list of people who were being vetted to have their rights restored after he lost them following a 2011 domestic violence misdemeanor conviction.\n\nMahmoud Khalil speaks to members of media at Columbia University in New York City on 1 June 2024.\n\nThe Trump administration invoked an obscure immigration law in an attempt to deport a recent Columbia University graduate and a lawful US permanent resident who helped lead campus protests against Israel last year. Mahmoud Khalil, 30, who graduated in December with a master’s degree from Columbia, was arrested by Ice officers in New York on Saturday and sent to a detention center in Louisiana. Khalil was told by Ice officers that his student visa was being revoked, but when he replied that he actually held a green card, Ice officers told him that was being pulled too. A federal judge in Manhattan ordered the government not to deport Khalil while the legality of his detention was under review in a legal challenge.\n\nThe US education department announced that it was firing more than 1,300 workers, effectively gutting the agency that manages federal loans for colleges and enforces civil rights laws in schools. The cuts could be a harbinger for Trump to essentially shut down the department, as he has said he wants to do, even though it cannot be closed without the approval of Congress.\n\nDonald Trump climbs into a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington DC on 11 March 2025.\n\nDonald Trump climbed into a cherry-red Tesla Model S and vowed to buy it in an extraordinary promotion of Tesla at the White House, as Musk’s companies faced escalating protests in response to his aggressive cost-cutting efforts as the de-facto head of the “department of government efficiency”. Trump said that Musk has been “treated very unfairly by a very small group of people”, in an apparent reference to peaceful protests and violence against Tesla dealerships and charging stations. The event on the South Lawn raised ethics questions of the president rewarding a donor and ally by giving Musk’s company free advertising with the White House as a backdrop.\n\nElon Musk signaled to Donald Trump’s advisers that he wants to put $100m into groups controlled by the Trump political operation, the New York Times reported . Musk suggested he wanted to make the donations not to his own Super Pac, which is called America Pac and has spent heavily on Trump’s campaign during the 2024 election, but to an entity affiliated with the president.\n\nA federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a vast portion of Donald Trump’s executive order that threatened to hurt a major law firm from taking effect, ruling the president used national security concerns as a pretext to punish the firm Perkins Coie for once working with Hillary Clinton. The US district judge Beryl Howell rejected Trump’s contentions and entered a temporary restraining order on Wednesday that halted most of the executive order. The restraining order did not apply to the revocation of clearances, since Perkins Coie had not sought that in their request.\n\nSteel coils seen on the grounds of a steel plant in Hamilton, Canada, on 13 March 2025.\n\nDonald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum went into effect, sparking immediate threats of retaliation from the EU and with a series of trading partners. The tariffs of 25% hit metal imports from every country that sells steel and aluminum to the US. Many domestic steel and aluminum manufacturers supported the move, saying it would protect their industry against foreign competitors, but Canada said it would impose retaliatory tariffs on $20bn worth of American imports, including metals, computers and sporting goods. And the EU announced tariffs on up to $28bn worth of goods including bourbon, boats and motorcycles.\n\nThe Trump administration asked the US supreme court to lift a nationwide pause imposed on the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreign residents. The move marked the first time that Trump’s birthright citizenship order reached the nation’s highest court after three federal courts, in Massachusetts, Maryland and Washington state, had temporarily blocked the order from taking effect.\n\nThe Guardian reported that the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, had set forth plans to start a sweeping overhaul of the judge advocate general’s corps as part of an effort to make the US military less restricted by the laws of armed conflict. The possible changes, under the leadership of Hegseth’s personal lawyer and former naval commander Tim Parlatore, ranged from a reinterpretation of the US rules of engagement on the battlefield to the way that charges are brought under the military justice system.\n\nBelgian beer is stocked on shelves for sale at a liquor store in Los Angeles, California on 14 March 2025.\n\nDonald Trump threatened to escalate a trade war with the European Union, saying in a social media post that he could impose 200% tariffs on European wine and champagne. The announcement came a day after the EU unveiled plans to retaliate against a batch of US tariffs that took effect this week on steel aluminum, by imposing 50% tariffs on imports of US whiskey and several other American products. The EU said the retaliatory tariffs would come in two waves: first, with tariffs as high as 50% on US products including Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon that took effect on 1 April; and second, tariffs in mid-April that would target farm products and industrial goods that disproportionately affected Republican-leaning districts.\n\nTrump attacked a private law firm for the third time since taking office, signing an executive order that suspended its lawyers from holding security clearances and restricted its employees from entering federal buildings, getting government jobs or receiving any money from federal contracts. The aggressive move came two days after a federal judge in Washington issued a temporary injunction that blocked a similar order against the law firm Perkins Coie from taking immediate effect.\n\nDonald Trump and Pam Bondi shake hands during his visit to the Department of Justice to address its workers, in Washington DC on 14 March 2025.\n\nCementing his literal and physical takeover of the justice department, Donald Trump swept into its headquarters to rail against the criminal cases he defeated by virtue of returning to the presidency in an extraordinary victory lap the department had perhaps never before seen. The event was billed as a policy address for the administration to tout its focus on combating illegal immigration and drug trafficking, but the majority of the president’s freewheeling remarks focused instead on his personal grievances with the department. Trump spoke from a specially constructed stage in the great hall of the main justice building, in front of a velvet blue curtain that notably hid away two art deco statues depicting the “Spirit of Justice” and the “Majesty of Justice”.\n\nThe FBI director, Kash Patel, announced a reorganization of the bureau by decentralizing the command structure and dividing field offices over three regions. The change means the top FBI officials in 52 field offices would no longer answer to the deputy director, and instead to three “branch directors” at FBI headquarters who will be in charge of the east, west and central regions. The remaining three FBI offices – the largest in the country – of New York, Washington and Los Angeles will continue to report to the deputy director.\n\nA handout photo made available by the presidency of El Salvador shows guards at the Terrorism Confinement Cente transferring alleged members of the gang known as Tren de Aragua, in San Luis Talpa, El Salvador, on 16 March 2025.\n\nA federal judge ordered the Trump administration to stop using an obscure wartime law to deport hundreds of Venezuelans without a hearing, ruling in an emergency order that any deportation flights that had already departed from the US needed to return. In an emergency hearing, the chief US district judge in Washington, James Boasberg, said he would issue a temporary order blocking the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target suspected Venezuelan gang members with little or no due process. “This is something you need to make sure is complied with immediately,” Boasberg directed the government.\n\nThe Trump administration appeared to violate a court order by sending hundreds of Venezuelans accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador . El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, posted on social media that 238 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and 23 members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 had arrived and were in custody as part of a deal under which the US will pay the Central American country to hold them in its 40,000-person capacity “terrorism confinement centre”. But Bukele’s post came hours after the chief US district judge in Washington, James Boasberg, blocked the deportations and ordered any flights to turn around in an order issued at 7pm ET.\n\nIn a dramatic escalation of his rupture with Zelenskyy. Trump paused all military aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia, causing yet more consternation to Washington’s Nato allies. European anxieties were compounded further when Vance appeared to dismiss British and French capacity to guarantee Ukraine’s future security. Pressing the case for a mineral deal with the US as the best guarantor, JD Vance , the US vice-president, told Fox News: “That is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.” The comment was taken as an insult in Britain – which along with France, has offered to send peacekeeping troops and whose forces fought in US-led military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy , the Ukrainian president, issued a statement aimed at placating Trump, who had proclaimed him unready to make peace with Russia. Faced with a loss of US support, the Ukrainian president said he was ready to work “constructively” under Trump’s “strong leadership”.\n\nDonald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the US Capitol on 4 March in Washington DC.\n\nIn an extraordinarily rambunctious, one-hour, 40-minute address to a joint session of Congress, Trump declared that his presidency was “just getting started” after his whirlwind return to the White House that has seen a flurry of executive orders and the federal bureaucracy upended in a drastic cost-cutting measures spearheaded by Doge. Democrats registered protests by holding of placards as Trump spoke, while some left the chamber early. and one, Al Green of Texas, was ejected after shouting that Trump had “no mandate”.\n\nA day after ushering in in 25% tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico – the US’s two closest trading partners – the president performed a partial U-turn by exempting car makers . The move followed a call with the heads of the country’s three biggest car manufacturers, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. Meanwhile, leading US retailers warned that prices were “highly likely” to start rising as a result of the tariffs, a consequence at odds with Trump’s election campaign promise to “make America affordable again”.\n\nResidents remove debris from their home damaged by Russian shelling in the city of Kostiantynivka, Ukraine, on 21 February 2025.\n\nHaving already cut off the flow of arms, the Trump administration hit Ukraine with a fresh blow by stopping the sharing of intelligence with its supposed ally. The move in effect left the Ukrainians blind to Russian strategic bombers and ballistic missile launches.\n\nAs controversy raged over the cuts to government agencies imposed by Doge, Musk told congressional Republicans that he was not to blame for the mass firings that had provoked widespread outrage. At a cabinet meeting in the White House apparently called to addressing simmering cabinet discontent, Trump said department heads and not Musk – who was present – had the power to hire and fire federal workers and said they should do so wielding a “scalpel” to preserve the best people. The comment was widely seen as signalling the reining of Musk, who had been widely seen as running amok across government.\n\nTrump performed yet another backflip on tariffs, delaying imposing import duties on goods from Canada and Mexico until April. The move followed nervousness on the stock market, with the S&P 500 index falling by 1.8% in a single day. The president, however, claimed his volte face had “nothing to do” with market developments.\n\nTrump said he would sign an executive order barring student loan forgiveness to public servants engaged in “improper activities”.\n\nThe administration announced the cancellation of $400m in grants to Columbia University in New York over the institution’s supposed failure to protect students from antisemitic harassment. The university’s New York campus – in common with others throughout the US – has been the site of prolonged protests against Israel’s military bombardment of Gaza.\n\nIn more troubling remarks on Ukraine, Trump said he found it easier to deal with Russia and appeared to sympathize with Vladimir Putin after massive Russian air strikes that followed the decision to stop US intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Putin was “doing what anybody would do”, Trump said – despite have issued, hours earlier, a vague threat to impose sanctions and tariffs on Moscow over the strike.\n\nTrump warned Republicans against shutting down the government as a 14 March deadline loomed that would spell that very outcome in the absence of the adoption of a new spending bill. Instead, the president urged GOP members of Congress to maintain unity and vote for a stop gap funding bill stitched together by Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nPeople protest outside of the headquarters for United States Agency for International Development (USAid), before congressional Democrats hold news conference in Washington, DC on 3 February.\n\nTrump insisted Musk and Marco Rubio , the US secretary of state, had a “great relationship” after the New York Times reported details of the pair facing off in an angry exchange during the cabinet meeting called to clear the air over Doge cuts. “There is no clash,” Trump wrote in a social media post, despite Elon Musk reportedly lambasting Rubio for firing “nobody” and dismissing him as being “good on TV”, while the secretary of state hit back by voicing his resentment over Doge’s gutting of USAid, the foreign assistance agency over which he is nominally in charge.\n\nOn Ukraine, the president told reporters on board Air Force One that the US had “just about ended” its suspension of intelligence with the country and said he expected good results ahead of forthcoming talks with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrucks prepare to cross the US-Canada border at the Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, on 8 March.\n\nTrump declined to the rule out the possibility that the US economy could fall into a recession and that inflation could rise as uncertainty continued over his tariffs policy . “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big,” he told Fox News.\n\nEarlier in the day, the US joined Russia, Belarus and North Korea in voting against an EU-Ukrainian resolution condemning Russia on the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion, another sign of Trump’s sharp turn toward Putin.\n\nFrance’s president, Emmanuel Macron, warned Trump against a “surrender” of Ukraine during a visit to the White House, as the US president said Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the conflict. (The Kremlin has pushed back on this.)\n\nThe US office of personnel management told agency officials that federal workers were not required to respond to billionaire Elon Musk’s demand that they defend their recent accomplishments or risk being fired, even as Donald Trump indicated support for the ultimatum. The email sparked widespread chaos and confusion amid ongoing turmoil Musk’s Doge has inflicted on the federal workforce. After government departments gave their employees differing instructions as to whether they should respond to the message, OPM, which manages the federal workforce, announced that compliance with the email was voluntary and that failing to do so by midnight would not be considered a resignation, as Musk had warned.\n\nThe Trump administration announced that immigrants in the US without authorization could face fines and prison time if they fail to submit their personal data to a government registry while the president floated the creation of a “gold card” visa that would give wealthy foreigners a pathway to citizenship for a $5m fee .\n\nThe White House said it would pick which media outlets are allowed to participate in the presidential press pool, drawing sharp condemnation from the White House Correspondents’ Association , which warned: “In a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps.”\n\nIn a dramatic vote, House Republicans unified behind a budget blueprint , taking a major step toward advancing Donald Trump’s “big BEAUTIFUL” tax cut and immigration agenda. But vulnerable Republicans face a brewing backlash over the plan, which would almost certainly require significant reductions to social safety net programs that serve the poor. House Democrats plan to hammer Republicans over their support for the measure and the potential cuts to Medicaid required to pay for it as they plot a return to power in next year’s midterms. But Trump’s fiscal plan is far from guaranteed: Republican negotiators from both the House and Senate must now reconcile their competing budget blueprints to move forward.\n\nThe supreme court handed the president his first victory, granting the Trump administration’s request to pause a lower court’s deadline for the government to resume nearly $2bn in foreign aid payments.\n\nA Pentagon memo filed in court on Wednesday said transgender service members would be separated from the US military unless they receive an exemption.\n\nA new White House memo instructed federal agencies to submit plans for “a significant reduction” in their staff by 13 March, potentially setting the stage to shrink the government workforce by tens of thousands more in the coming weeks. A top Senate Democrat warned that Trump may be pursuing a mineral rights deal with Vladimir Putin and Russia as well as Zelenskyy and Ukraine.\n\nDonald Trump used the first full cabinet meeting of his second term to heap praise on Musk and his billionaire ally’s mission to dramatically reduce the size of the federal government. Though not a member of Trump’s cabinet, Musk attended and took center stage as the secretaries sat mostly silently for the hourlong meeting. The tech mogul defended Doge’s actions, which have stoked confusion and backlash, but conceded that the team would make mistakes, citing a decision to cancel an Ebola prevention effort that was “quickly” reinstated. During the summit, Trump also threatened to slap 25% tariffs on the European Union and announced that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, would visit the White House to sign a minerals deal with the US.\n\nSenate Democrats publicly – and some Republicans privately – raised concerns over the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid and cuts to USAid.\n\nThe ruling came on the same day that the Trump administration moved to terminate hundreds of workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent climate research agency housed within the Department of Commerce.\n\nA federal judge found that the mass firings of probationary employees as part of the Trump administration’s government downsizing effort were likely unlawful.\n\nDonald Trump holds a letter from King Charles III during a meeting with Keir Starmer in the Oval Office.\n\nKeir Starmer, the British prime minister, arrived at the White House bearing a letter from King Charles as he quietly appealed to Trump not to abandon Ukraine as the US president searches for a speedy end to Russia’s brutal invasion of the country. In remarks, Starmer praised Trump for “changing the conversation” and making peace possible in Ukraine while Trump denied calling Zelenskyy a dictator, despite having done so, and suggested Vladimir Putin could be trusted. En route to Washington, Starmer pledged to raise the country’s defense spending, a commitment seen as a way to persuade Trump to provide a “backstop” for European security in Ukraine. And in a major relief for the British premier, Trump indicated that he would not slap harsh tariffs on the UK.\n\nThe Democratic party sued Trump over a recent executive order it says violates federal election law by giving him too much power over the independent federal election commission.\n\nThe White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said that Trump had “asked Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to depart the White House” after their contentious exchange in the Oval Office.\n\nThe White House said that classified documents seized by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago in 2022 had been returned to Trump.\n\nEuropean leaders and Democrats rallied around Zelenskyy, voicing continued support for Ukraine, while Trump’s Republican allies demand the Ukrainian leader apologize.\n\nIn the explosive Oval Office meeting, Trump and Vance assailed and berated Zelenskyy in a storm of accusations and falsehoods about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The tense exchange ended with Zelenskyy leaving the White House early, without signing a controversial minerals deal that was seen as key to unlocking US security guarantees for European peacekeepers in Ukraine. During the exchange, which played out publicly on live TV, Trump said Zelenskyy was “gambling with world war three” and told the Ukrainian president to come back “when he is ready for peace”. Hours later, Zelenskyy sought to de-escalate the situation in an interview on Fox News, but Trump appeared unmoved as he departed Washington for his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nSupporters of Ukraine protested against the Trump administration across the US, including a Vermont ski resort where Vance was vacationing with his family.\n\nTrump signed an executive order establishing English as the official language of the US.\n\nMusk renewed his demand that every federal employee send an email detailing their recent accomplishments, a week after the original demand sparked chaos and confusion across the government workforce.\n\nA federal judge in Washington blocked Trump from ousting the leader of a federal watchdog agency, ruling that the effort to terminate the official without cause was “unlawful”. The decision by US district judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington allows Hampton Dellinger to remain the head of the office of special counsel, which protects federal whistleblowers. In her ruling, Jackson wrote that upholding the president’s ability to fire Dellinger would give him “a constitutional license to bully officials in the executive branch into doing his will”. The case is likely to be decided by the supreme court.\n\nThe health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, urged Americans to get the MMR vaccine in response to a growing measles epidemic in Texas, days after Kennedy, who has long sowed skepticism with his endorsement of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, downplayed the situation as “not unusual”.\n\nThe fallout continued from Trump and Zelenskyy’s disastrous Oval Office meeting , as the Ukrainian leader sought to recalibrate and insisted a minerals deal was ready to be signed during a diplomatic visit to London. While Europe rallies behind Ukraine, Trump’s Republican allies, including the House speaker, Mike Johnson, said Zelenskyy may have to resign, a suggestion Senator Bernie Sanders called “horrific”. The Democratic senator Chris Murphy said Trump’s White House had in effect become “an arm of the Kremlin”.\n\nTrump nominated Edward Martin, a January 6 defender and Stop the Steal activist, to serve as US attorney for the District of Columbia. Martin had served in an interim role and was dismissing any pending cases against the January 6 rioters.\n\nProtestors showed up at state capitols and other major cities across the country to speak out against the Trump administration and Musk, rallying to “stop the coup” of the federal government.\n\nPeople protest against Trump and Musk in New York, on Monday.\n\nFederal workers who were on their probationary periods were fired indiscriminately across various agencies over the holiday weekend, leaving gaps in aviation, nuclear safety, national parks, food safety and a host of other government jobs. Elon Musk and his so-called “department of government efficiency” team continued their march across agencies to find areas to cut. A top Social Security Administration official quit after Musk’s team tried to access people’s personal data.\n\nAnother executive order signed on this day calls for a report that would recommend how to reduce the costs associated with in vitro fertilization. Some in the anti-abortion movement oppose IVF and reacted negatively to the order.\n\nTrump appeared with Musk in a joint interview with Fox host Sean Hannity, where the president and his billionaire backer complimented each other relentlessly: Musk said he loves Trump and called him a “good man” while Trump called Musk “brilliant” and a “very good person”.\n\nTrump signed an executive order to expand his power over independent agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, claiming he requires “presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch”. These agencies would see presidential control over their policies and budgets, a change from the current process, under the order, which is likely to be challenged in court.\n\nTrump called Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator” after the Ukrainian president said Trump appeared to be “trapped” in a Russian “disinformation bubble”.\n\nTrump attempted to rewrite the history of Russia’s war against Ukraine, saying Ukraine started it when in reality Russia invaded the country unprovoked.\n\n“LONG LIVE THE KING!” Trump said of himself after moving to block a congestion pricing policy in New York City, inviting a legal battle with his home state. His claim of royalty brought strong backlash after his first month in office included various ways he’s attempting to consolidate power and threats to defy the courts if they go against his wishes.\n\nTrump continued the mass firing of federal workers, axing people at the Internal Revenue Service and in disaster recovery, among others. Some fired were then rehired, including public health workers responsible for responding to the spreading bird flu.\n\nAt the conference, JD Vance said immigration was the “greatest threat” to Europe and the US, at least until 30 days ago here.\n\nTrump’s acolytes, riding high after one month of slash-and-burn rightwing governance, gathered for the Conservative Political Action Conference. Elon Musk appeared in sunglasses and a black Maga hat and wielded a chainsaw given to him as a gift by far-right Argentinian president Javier Milei. Steve Bannon, the far-right leader and Trump booster, gave a fascist-style salute on stage.\n\nSeparately, the Proud Boys were back in Washington DC, with key leaders fresh off their Trump pardons for participating in the January 6 insurrection. Enrique Tarrio, a former national leader of the far-right group, was arrested near the US Capitol on a charge that he assaulted a woman protesting a gathering attended by him and others who received pardons.\n\nTrump reassigned the top official at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an effort to speed up deportations. The administration also rescinded its decision to cut off legal aid for unaccompanied immigrant children, just three days after it ordered government-funded attorneys across the country to immediately stop their work, a sign of the chaotic nature of the Trump presidency.\n\nThe Associated Press sued the Trump administration after Trump’s team blocked the news agency from attending press events because the organization has continued using “Gulf of Mexico” in its reporting rather than the Trump-branded “Gulf of America”.\n\nElon Musk orchestrated emails sent by the Trump administration to all federal workers demanding they outline in five bullet points what they did at their jobs in the past week or risk termination, the latest escalation against the civil service. Kash Patel, the newly confirmed FBI director, told his agency employees they didn’t need to respond, and other agencies told workers to hold off on replies as well.\n\nTrump took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) for an all-out brag session, claiming he had saved the country and actually won the election by more, repeating unspecified lies that Democrats were cheating on elections. His victory lap included boasts of pardoning January 6 rioters, some of whom were in attendance, and killing diversity initiatives.\n\nSome at CPAC advocated for overriding the constitution to elect Trump for a third term, calling their quest for a Trump reign the Third Term Project. But at least one elected Republican, Oklahoma senator Markwayne Mullin, said he didn’t support the idea.\n\nAnti-Trump conservatives and centrists held a competing conference this weekend, dubbed Principles First, to counter the Conservative Political Action Conference’s (CPAC) Trump fest. But Principles First attenders, particularly officers who defended the Capitol during the insurrection, saw harassment from January 6 pardonee and Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, and the conference was subject to bomb threats on 23 February signed “Enrique T”. that said it was to honor the “J6 hostages” and “Emperor Trump”.\n\nWeek 4\n\n16 February 2025 Day 28 Trump asked the supreme court to let him fire the head of a federal agency that protects government whistleblowers, marking his first appeal to the justices on America’s highest court since he took office. The justice department’s filing asked the conservative-majority court to lift a judge’s court order temporarily reinstating Hampton Dellinger as the leader of the office of special counsel.

Trump’s limousine, known as “the Beast”, led Daytona 500 drivers on two laps around the Florida racetrack. “This is your favorite president,” he told them. “I’m a big fan. I am a really big fan of you people.”\n\n15 February 2025 Day 27 View image in fullscreen ‘Napoleon I on the Imperial Throne’, 1806. Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images Trump went on social media to signal continued resistance to limits on his executive authority in the face of multiple legal challenges. “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” the president wrote on his Truth Social network. The phrase, attributed to Napoleon, the French military leader who eventually declared himself emperor, drew immediate criticism from Democrats. “Spoken like a true dictator,” Senator Adam Schiff of California, a longtime adversary of Trump, wrote on X. Also on Saturday: The US envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, told a global security conference in Munich that the US would act as an intermediary in talks with Ukraine and Russia. Asked about the prospects of the Europeans being at the table, Kellogg said: “I’m [from] a school of realism. I think that’s not gonna happen.”\n\n14 February 2025 Day 26 View image in fullscreen Vice-President JD Vance delivers his speech during the 61st Munich security conference. Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images JD Vance, the vice-president, stunned the Munich security conference by accusing European leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration and running in fear from voters’ true beliefs. Vance suggested that Europe was infected by media censorship, cancelled elections and political correctness. “The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor,” the vice-president said. “And what I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values.” The blistering remarks were condemned by the European Union and Germany but drew praise from Russian state television. Also on Friday: Members of Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” arrived at the Pentagon in what appeared to be their first meeting with defense department staff. Under pressure from Trump’s justice department leadership, prosecutors in Washington asked a federal judge to drop bribery and fraud charges against the New York mayor, Eric Adams, rather than see the entire public integrity office be fired. The White House said it would ban the Associated Press from events in the Oval Office and Air Force One over the news agency’s refusal to obey Trump’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America.\n\n13 February 2025 Day 25 View image in fullscreen Donald Trump announces reciprocal tariffs in the Oval Office. Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images Trump unveiled plans for the US to implement “reciprocal” tariffs on all countries with which it conducts trade. “They charge us a tax or tariff and we charge them the exact same,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. Signing a memorandum called the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan”, the president admitted the tariffs could cause Americans some “some short-term disturbance”, adding: “Prices could go up somewhat short-term. But prices will also go down.” Also on Thursday: The Senate voted 52–48 to confirm the longtime vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr as the next health and human services secretary. Senator Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor, was the only Republican to join all Democrats in opposition, saying he “will not condone the relitigation of proven cures”. Trump was equivocal when asked what concessions Russia should be willing to make to secure a peace deal in Ukraine. He told reporters at a press conference: “It’s too early to say what’s going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot. Maybe they won’t. It’s all dependent on what is going to happen.” Danielle Sassoon, the acting US attorney for the southern district of New York, quit after the justice department ordered her to drop the corruption case against the New York City mayor, Eric Adams. Several other justice department officials also resigned after they were ordered to drop the case.\n\n12 February 2025 Day 24 View image in fullscreen Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks with Donald Trump via a phone line in Kyiv on 12 February. Photograph: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters Trump held separate phone calls with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an effort to end the war that has raged for three years. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters at a briefing: “They were very good calls. They were very positive.” Later Trump told reporters he expected to come face to face with Putin soon. “We ultimately expect to meet,” he said in the Oval Office. “In fact, we expect that he’ll come here, and I’ll go there, and we’re going to meet also, probably in Saudi Arabia. The first time we’ll meet in Saudi Arabia.” Also on Wednesday: The Senate confirmed the former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard in a 52–48 vote to serve as director of national intelligence. Senator Mitch McConnell, the former Senate leader, was the lone Republican to join all Democrats in opposition. The Senate budget committee voted 11–10 to approve a budget reconciliation bill intended to serve as a blueprint to get Trump’s border, energy and military agenda through Congress. Inflation rose to 3% on an annual basis in January, an increase from 2.9% in December, according to the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n11 February 2025 Day 23 View image in fullscreen Elon Musk carries his son X Æ A-Xii on his shoulders in the Oval Office of the White House. Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Joined by his four-year-old son X in the Oval Office, Elon Musk claimed the ”department of government efficiency’s” (Doge) goal was to “restore democracy”, contending that the federal bureaucracy had amassed too much power. The world’s richest man denied conflicts of interest. “You can see whether I’m doing something that’s benefiting one of my companies or not,” he told reporters. “I’ll be scrutinised nonstop.” Trump signed an executive order that seeks to “significantly reduce the size of government” by instructing agencies to undertake plans for “large-scale reductions in force”. Also on Tuesday: Trump stood by his plan for the US to take control of Gaza and redevelop it as a tourist destination while relocating 2 million Palestinians. During a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Trump told reporters: “We’re going to take it. We’re going to hold it. We’re going to cherish it.” The White House secured the release of Marc Fogel, an American teacher who had been imprisoned in Russia. The US released Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cybercriminal who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, in exchange. Trump claimed that he would abide by court decisions curbing his administration’s actions amid growing fears of a constitutional crisis following Vance’s assertion that “judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.”",

    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "Donald Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on imports from China on Wednesday unless the country rescinds its retaliatory tariffs on the United States by Tuesday.\n\nThe news comes on the third day of catastrophic market falls around the globe since Trump announced his trade war last Wednesday with tariffs on the US’s trading partners.\n\nAs part of that move the White House announced it would impose a 34% tariff on Chinese imports. In response, Beijing announced a 34% tariff on US imports.\n\nIn a statement on Truth Social on Monday morning, the US president said that China enacted the retaliatory tariffs despite his “warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs” would be “immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set”.\n\n“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote.\n\n“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!” he added. “Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.”\n\nChina’s US embassy said on Monday it would not cave to pressure or threats over the additional 50% tariffs. “We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” Liu Pengyu, an embassy spokesman, told Agence France-Presse.\n\nA senior White House official told ABC News that the increased tariffs on China would be on top of the 34% reciprocal tariff Trump announced last week and the 20% already in place.\n\nTrump’s new ultimatum to China marked the latest escalation from the White House and came as US stocks swung in and out of the red on Monday morning as a report circulated that Trump was going to pause the implementation of his sweeping tariffs for 90 days, but then was quickly dismissed by the White House as “fake news”.\n\nNot long after Trump threatened China with additional tariffs on Monday morning, he participated in a White House visit from the Los Angeles Dodgers to celebrate their World Series title.",

    "title": "The White Lotus season three finale review – the show’s least satisfying ending ever",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "Warning: this article contains spoilers for the finale of season three of The White Lotus. Do not read on unless you have seen episode eight, season three.\n\nIn the Hollywood Reporter’s recent oral history, Mike White bristled at the thought of The White Lotus lapsing into a formula. For most of its third season, this didn’t make a lot of sense. After all, in its depiction of the obliviously wealthy, its whodunnit structure and its now mandatory transgressive sex scenes, a lot of this year’s season felt like The White Lotus by numbers.\n\nThe finale went a little way to change things up, though. In the first two seasons, the long-promised deaths were both whoops-a-daisy accidents – in one, someone walked into the blade of a knife; in the other, Jennifer Coolidge fell off a boat – but this season ended in good old-fashioned murder. After last week assaulting the man he thought killed his father, Rick (Walton Goggins) was tracked by him back to the hotel. In retaliation, Rick shot him. Rick’s girlfriend, Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood), was caught in the crossfire of the ensuing shootout, and then Rick was shot by hotel security. Where The White Lotus was once led by farce, it now found itself being led by grim violence.\n\nIt was at least in keeping with the episodes that preceded it. This year’s White Lotus was darker and slower than previous outings. Realistically, this was always going to be the grimmest ending to a season since the series began. However, it was also perhaps the least satisfying.\n\nMuch as White might protest, there is a formula to The White Lotus. A death is always hinted at in the first episode, and the narrative is propelled by the discovery of what happened. And that means that, while all the headlines today will be about Rick and Chelsea, everything else that happened over the last couple of months ends up feeling like a red herring.\n\nThis was especially true of the finale. So many promising storylines, simply by dint of the fact that they didn’t result in death, just dissolved. Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger) arguably had the most interesting plot of the show, as an obnoxious materialistic alpha-bro whose eyes were gradually opened to life’s deeper meanings through drugs, spirituality and (to some extent) incest – but essentially sat the episode out, his journey unresolved. The story White has described as a “blond blob” – about three women who bitch about each other a lot – ended with a nothingy monologue that came out of nowhere and relied entirely on the ability of Carrie Coon (as Laurie) to elevate weak material through sheer strength of will. Remember when Victoria (Parker Posey) blanked Kate (Leslie Bibb) in episode two? It was never mentioned again.\n\nEven the big deaths failed to stand up to much interrogation. The man Rick killed (who was his father, but everyone guessed that a month ago) was married to the owner of the hotel. And yet Rick returned to the hotel anyway, after invading his home and assaulting him. Why not immediately leave the country? Why not spend even a second acknowledging the danger he was now in? It was such a startling, lazy lapse in logic that it undermined the entire plot.\n\nView image in fullscreen Could Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), pictured here with Zion (Nicholas Duvernay), be the next big thing in a future series? Photograph: HBO\n\nThe White Lotus has always been a brilliant moment-to-moment show. And, in fairness, the finale did some terrific work building a sense of inescapable dread purely through cutaways. As the climax drew near, monkeys screamed. A hotel worker spraying some foliage became something out of Apocalypse Now. Somehow, a simple shot of the island panning into view became the most terrifying thing you have ever seen. But this all means much less when the show forgets how to hang itself together properly.\n\nBut there’s always next time. The White Lotus has become a wildly important show for HBO, so more is certainly to come. And, if nothing else, White used this finale to plant the seeds of something that could end up being very special indeed. I’m talking, of course, about Belinda.\n\nIn the first season, Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) was a hotel worker who found herself bonding with and then being screwed over by Tanya (Coolidge). This time she found herself becoming extraordinarily wealthy after meeting Coolidge’s ex-husband, and then screwed over Pornchai, her colleague turned love interest who wanted to start a business with her. The season ended with Belinda sailing away into the distance, her wildest dreams achieved at the cost of her humanity.\n\nMight Belinda turn up for season four, just as rich as patronising and oblivious as all the White Lotus guests she has spent years rolling her eyes at? If so, it would be a heel turn for the ages. At the very least, it would go some way to salvaging what has ended up being a frustratingly middling season of television.",

    "title": "Here’s one key thing you should know about Trump’s shock to the world economy: it could work | James Meadway",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "It’s less than a week since Donald Trump’s sensational announcement that he was unilaterally ending the world’s trading system with the imposition of a 10% minimum tariff for trading with the US – and a very much higher rate for those countries unfortunate enough to have the US as a major export partner. Long-term allies such as Japan and South Korea have been hammered with tariffs of around 25%, while export-dependent poorer countries such as Vietnam, which sells about a third of its exports to the US, have been hit with tariffs in excess of 45%. A further round of global debt crises is possible as heavily indebted countries face the sudden loss of export earnings.\n\nGlobal stock markets have tumbled as panicked investors dump shares, and political condemnation has been near-universal. China has already retaliated with 34% tariffs, threatening an escalating trade war. Right now, it looks and feels like disastrous overreach by a uniquely erratic administration at the behest of a president with a terrifyingly limited grasp of how the modern economy works.\n\nTrump has talked about imposing tariffs on the world since he first rose to prominence in the 1980s, when his target was Japan. In a political career notable for its jack-knifes in policy and direction, tariffs – “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” – have been a constant. But this is about far more than his long-cherished whims. However inconsistent or even confused Trump may sometimes appear to be, those around him have a clear-eyed view of what they want to achieve.\n\nHis Treasury secretary, hedgefund billionaire Scott Bessent, has spoken of a “global economic reordering” that he intends to shape to the benefit of the US’s elite. Trump’s new chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, wrote a lengthy paper, A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, shortly before his appointment. The latter is particularly ambitious – detailing how the US should use not only tariffs but also the threat of withdrawing its security support to compel its friends and allies to accept cuts in payments due from the Federal Reserve on their US Treasury bills. This would be a potentially massive loss to them, akin, in reality, to a US debt default. But it is tariffs that are the cutting edge of the plan – leveraging the US’s power as the world’s largest consumer and greatest debtor to compel other countries into a negotiation on terms.\n\nAfter decades winning in an international trading game it wrote and refereed the rules for, the US is now facing serious competition – primarily from China, but with Europe as an expensive irritant. The response of this administration is to kick over the table, and demand everyone starts again. What it ultimately wants is a cheaper dollar to revive US manufacturing and Chinese competition held off, all the while keeping the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the rest of the world will pay the price.\n\nThere are precedents. In October 1979, Paul Volcker, newly appointed as chair of the Federal Reserve, drove up interest rates to a remarkable 13% in a bid to tackle inflation, later raising them to 17%. Soon the US was in recession. Millions lost their jobs over the next two years, notably in manufacturing, where soaring interest rates had driven up the value of the dollar, making US exports less affordable on the world market. After a light easing of interest rate hell by the Fed, Volcker applied a second dose of the medicine, driving interest rates up to 19% and forcing the economy back into a double-dip recession. Unemployment peaked at around 10% in late 1982.\n\nView image in fullscreen Ronald Reagan and Paul Volcker in the Oval Office at the White House, Washington DC, July 1981. Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\n\nBut by mid-1983, inflation had come down to 2.5%. For the rest of the 1980s, the US economy boomed. The “Volcker shock” appeared to have worked. Volcker is today a folk hero among central bankers: Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve during the 2008 crisis, praised Volcker’s “independence” and willingness to brazen out the political storm.\n\nMore decisive than lower inflation, however, was the reshaping of the US economy Volcker’s interest-rate shock accelerated: with manufacturing in freefall, investment flooded into finance and property, firing up what became the great credit bubble of the 1990s and 2000s. The world economy was reordered around a US that acted as a giant sink for its output – swallowing exports from the rest of the world on seemingly limitless borrowing. China’s extraordinary boom was the flipside of US debt and deindustrialisation. The Volcker shock, more than any other single action, created the globalised world system that Trump is now bent on destroying.\n\nFew would have bet on Volcker’s world-shaping capacity at the time. The stock market response to the shock was immediate and unanimous. US shares plunged by a record 8% in the two days after his announcement. The S&P 500 lost 27% of its value before August 1982 – two years of grinding decline. Manufacturers and unions hated it, understandably: they were on the wrong side of an epochal reconfiguration of US capitalism. But they were not the only losers: rising interest rates in the US meant less developed countries had to spend more on servicing debts, just as recession squeezed their major export markets. The result was the so-called “third world” debt crisis, as heavily indebted countries across the global south plunged into spirals of economic decline and soaring indebtedness.\n\nOver the weekend, Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick were doing the media rounds, insisting that there would be no climbdown on the tariffs. Trump is not for turning on what is clearly for him a personal crusade. Already, countries such as Vietnam are promising to cut all their tariffs on US goods – a clear and brutal demonstration of the US’s continuing economic power. The administration has claimed 50 other countries have also asked to open negotiations. By the end of the week, expect Trump to be triumphantly announcing more such concessions from economies in the global south. His real target – China – will be a far tougher nut to crack, if it breaks at all.\n\nPerhaps the rolling market chaos will become too much. Perhaps the administration will blink first. There is no guarantee this extraordinary gamble will work, not even for those in the clique around Trump. But it would be a mistake to assume it cannot work – and however the pieces now land, they will not return to their old places.",

    "title": "Which Trump-supporting billionaires have lost the most in tariff markets turmoil?",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "With global stock markets reeling from Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping border taxes, some of the US president’s business allies have been left counting the cost.\n\nThe world’s 500 richest people lost a collective $536bn (£417bn) in the first two days of stock market trading after Trump’s “liberation day” announcement last Wednesday. It was the biggest two-day loss of wealth ever recorded by Bloomberg’s billionaires index.\n\nWithin that, a coterie of tycoons who have supported Trump or attended his inauguration in January have seen their wealth shrink. Here, we look at the four who have been worst hit by the market turmoil – and one billionaire still riding high this year.\n\nElon Musk The world’s richest man and the chief executive of Tesla – who has already seen his wealth drop precipitously after becoming a high-profile and controversial figure in Trump’s administration – has taken the biggest hit by some margin. Tesla was already facing a potential buyer backlash over its CEO’s controversial behaviour, and as its shares plunged, $31bn was wiped off Musk’s net worth between the opening bell on Thursday and the market closing on Friday. The recent fall in Tesla’s stock has meant his private rockets and satellites business, SpaceX, became his most valuable asset. So far this year, Musk’s estimated wealth has fallen by $130bn, although he still comfortably remains the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $302bn. Tesla’s shares fell nearly 5% on Wall Street on Monday afternoon, adding to these losses.\n\nMark Zuckerberg View image in fullscreen Mark Zuckerberg. Photograph: Manuel Orbegozo/Reuters The Facebook founder and owner of Instagram and WhatsApp had the next biggest loss, at more than $27bn. The world’s third richest person, with an estimated net worth of $179bn, was hit by a plunge in the value of Meta. Its stock dropped almost 14% over two days as the tariff war hit tech companies particularly hard. Its stock edged slightly higher on Monday, up almost 1%. Many of the world’s biggest companies rely on markets in Asia, which had the heaviest tariffs imposed on them by Trump, for manufacturing, computer chips and IT services. Zuckerberg, who performed a remarkable “Trump pivot” of Meta weeks before Trump took office, has seen more than $28bn wiped off his personal fortune so far this year.\n\nJeff Bezos View image in fullscreen Jeff Bezos. Photograph: CraSH/imageSpace/Rex/Shutterstock The Amazon founder and Washington Post owner had the next biggest two-day loss, at $23.5bn. The market value of Amazon, a leading seller of imported goods from around the world, has fallen by hundreds of billions of dollars this year. China-based sellers have more than a 50% market share of Amazon’s third-party marketplace, while its cloud services business also relies on tech produced primarily by manufacturers in Asian countries, such as Taiwan. Bezos, the world’s second richest person, with a net worth estimated at $193bn, has seen $45bn wiped off his fortune so far this year. Amazon’s shares were marginally higher – up 0.4% - on Monday. In February, Bezos’s $10bn climate and biodiversity fund halted funding to one of the world’s most important climate-certification organisations, in a move viewed by some as a “bowing down” to Trump and his opposition to climate action.\n\nBernard Arnault View image in fullscreen Bernard Arnault. Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters The owner of the LVMH luxury goods empire lost $6bn on Thursday and more than $5bn on Friday as Trump’s tariffs hit the Asian factory hubs that underpin the global garment industry. Shares fell even further on Monday, by more than 4%. The net worth of Europe’s richest person, and the fourth wealthiest individual in the world according to Bloomberg, has dropped to $158bn – down $18.6bn so far this year. Arnault has been friends with Trump since the early 1980s when they met at a charity dinner, and the US is his business empire’s largest market, equal in size to all European sales. Arnault, also known as the “wolf in cashmere”, had prime seats at Trump’s second inauguration along with his wife, son and daughter. “I have just returned from the US, and I have witnessed the winds of optimism in that country,” he said on his return. “Coming back to France is a bit like taking a cold shower.” A 20% tariff has since been imposed on the EU, while key countries for garment manufacturing in Asia have tariffs of up to 54%.",

    "title": "Caribbean is friend of US, not an enemy, tariff-hit regional leaders tell Trump",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "The Caribbean is a friend, not an enemy, leaders in the region have told Donald Trump after the US president’s imposition of worldwide import tariffs.\n\nThe prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, invited Trump to talk with leaders in the region and “work together to keep prices down for all of our people”, adding: “I say simply to President Trump: our economies are not doing your economy any harm in any way. They are too small to have any negative or distorted impact on your country.”\n\nMottley warned Caribbean citizens that the tariffs would mean “higher prices for all of us”.\n\nThe finance minister for St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), Camillo Gonsalves, who is visiting the UK to promote foreign investment, particularly from the Caribbean diaspora, said the US tariffs – which range from 10% to 38% on Caribbean countries – could have a detrimental impact on his country’s agricultural and fisheries sectors, and drive up the prices of imports, leading to unsustainable inflation and rises in the cost of living.\n\n“We import many, many products, fruits, vegetables, manufactured goods, meats … cement, steel, through Miami and other US ports,” Gonsalves told the Guardian. “And not all of those products are of American origin … but it’s a convenient point of transit for the Caribbean.”\n\nGoing through these US ports, he added, meant they would be subject to the increased US tariffs. “Those tariffs will become a cost; they will become a tax, essentially to Caribbean consumers,” he said.\n\nThe minister said SVG was working closely with other countries in the region who are part of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) to engage with the US on the matter, and that it was also looking at solutions such as developing partnerships with other countries in the Commonwealth.\n\nHe said: “I think that if the United States has made a policy decision to withdraw from global trade, it does not mean that global trade is dead. It simply means that one major player has withdrawn from the game … I believe that other countries that continue to see the advantages of global trade and globalisation will adapt … and I think that the Commonwealth connection is advantageous.”\n\nInvestment from SVG nationals living abroad could drive rapid growth, he said, estimating that their “economic strength” was about five times that of their fellow citizens at home.\n\nOn Friday, Mottley, who is also the chair of Caricom, issued a statement stressing that the Caribbean was already reaping the benefits of work to diversify economies and shake off the “legacy of our colonial dependence”, but admitting that the region was still “largely reliant on imports”, as she expressed concern about the impact of the tariffs.\n\n“We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but I want every Caribbean man and every Caribbean woman to hear me. This trade war and the possibility of a $1m to $1.5m levy on all Chinese-made ships entering US harbours will mean higher prices for all of us at the corner shop, higher prices at the supermarket, higher prices at the electronic store, higher prices for us at the shop, higher prices for us at the restaurant, higher prices for us at the car dealership and beyond,” she said.\n\nIn her statement, the Caricom chair proposed a set of actions to respond to the crisis. First, she said, the Caribbean community should “re-engage urgently, directly, and at the highest possible level with our friends in the United States of America”. She also urged countries to unite and avoid fighting “among each other for political gain”.\n\nShe said it was important to “redouble efforts to invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing” and “build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada”.\n\n“We must not rely solely on one or two markets. We need to be able to sell our Caribbean goods to a wider, more stable global market,” she said.",

    "title": "South Sudan says person at centre of US deportation row is from DRC",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "The government of South Sudan said on Monday that an individual at the centre of a deportation row with the US, which South Sudan refused to allow into the country at the weekend, is a citizen of neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nSouth Sudan said the individual was a man named Makula Kintu, not Nimeiri Garang, as his paperwork claimed and had been using travel documents which were not his. “In accordance with our immigration protocols, we returned him to the sending country for further processing,” the foreign ministry spokesperson, Apuk Ayuel Mayen, said.\n\nFootage released by the authorities in South Sudan’s capital, Juba, showed a man speaking to immigration authorities at Juba international airport, saying he was born in North Kivu, in the eastern DRC. He identified himself as Kintu and said he had been deported from the US against his will.\n\nOn Sunday, the US announced that it had revoked the visas of all South Sudanese passport holders in reaction to the refusal by immigration authorities at Juba international airport to repatriate the man, accusing the east African country of “taking advantage of the United States”.\n\nMayen, the foreign ministry spokesperson, said that South Sudan “deeply regrets” the blanket measure against all of the country’s citizens based on “an isolated incident involving misrepresentation by an individual who is not a South Sudanese national”.\n\nShe added that the government of South Sudan was open to receiving its citizens, whether they voluntarily leave the US or are deported, and had maintained open communication with the US, despite claims by Washington that it had been rebuffed.\n\nTrump administration officials have said the individual’s documents were verified by South Sudan’s embassy in Washington DC and that South Sudan had “violated” its obligation “by refusing to accept one of their nationals certified by their own embassy in Washington and repatriated to their country”.\n\nIn a post on social media, the US deputy secretary of state, Chris Landau, said: “Specifically, on February 13, 2025, the South Sudanese Embassy issued the individual an emergency travel letter certifying his nationality as South Sudanese and giving his date and place of birth (in what is now South Sudan, which then was part of Sudan).”\n\nLandau added that it was “unacceptable and irresponsible” for South Sudanese authorities to then reject a decision made by their embassy and “as far as we’re concerned, the Embassy’s certification is conclusive and the matter is closed”.\n\nMarco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said a visa and entry ban for South Sudanese citizens would go into immediate effect and would be reviewed once South Sudan, in the US government’s eyes, began cooperating again.\n\nJok Madut Jok, an academic specialising in South Sudan at Syracuse University, in upstate New York, said if the mistake was made at South Sudan’s Washington embassy, that doesn’t “get the US off the hook for this measure”. “On humanitarian grounds, this needs to be rolled back because it is too broad,” he said, adding that many people attempting to come to the US could be refugees fleeing conflict.\n\nSouth Sudanese passport holders have enjoyed “temporary protected status” (TPS) in the US since 2011 which affords them legal protections against deportation due to instability and fighting in their country of origin. The Department of Homeland Security believes 133 people from South Sudan were on the US TPS programme last year.\n\nDonald Trump wanted to end TPS during his first term and the US president has attempted to do so again, targeting nationals from Nicaragua, Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nTPS was renewed for South Sudanese nationals last September but is set to expire in May, which comes as South Sudan faces an escalating risk of renewed fighting by leaders from its two largest ethnic groups.\n\nSouth Sudan, the world’s youngest country, gained independence from Sudan in 2011, and has since struggled with armed conflict and poverty. Between 2013 and 2018, fighting between factions loyal to the current president, Salva Kiir Mayardit, and his vice-president, Riek Machar, killed nearly 400,000 people.\n\nAlexandra Ribe, an immigration attorney who specialises in humanitarian issues, said it is too early to tell what impact the measure would have on South Sudanese in the US as it was not clear what enforcement action immigration authorities would take, but described it as “punitive”.\n\nRibe said the measure would “send a chill down the spines of nationals from the targeted country who have nothing to do with the issue at hand”.",

    "content": "Accidentally boarding a boat packed with beer-swilling football fans would be some people’s idea of hell.\n\nBut Evan Johnston, a 21-year-old student from Arizona, said he “had a blast” after inadvertently joining a boat trip chartered by 150 Southend United supporters before their National League game at Sutton United on Saturday.\n\nAccording to the Southend Echo, Johnston boarded at Tower Millennium Pier in London believing he was getting on a tourist boat, but he was soon taken under the collective wing of a group of Southend fans.\n\n“I had originally planned to board the river cruise boat for the Hop-On-Hop-Off tour, which I assume was located on the same dock,” Johnson told the Echo. “The cruise would last an hour or so and then I planned to spend the rest of the day touring central London.\n\n“I had some suspicions when I was in line to board behind all of the Southend fans, because they seemed to know each other and were making chants I didn’t understand. But I decided to board anyways because I figured if they checked tickets they would just turn me around … But they didn’t check tickets, so I slipped on the boat undetected.”\n\nAndy Ward, one of the Southend supporters on board, told the Echo: “Someone on the boat told me a young lad was on the wrong boat and I just wanted to make sure he was OK. When I found him he was drinking and dancing with other Southend fans and even though you could see he was nervous everyone was just trying to make him feel welcome … He said someone gave him a match ticket but was unsure whether to go. I said to him come with us.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Evan Johnston with Southend United fans at Sutton.

Ben Goodliffe put Southend ahead on 24 minutes at VBS Community Stadium only for Ashley Nadesan to strike in the fourth minute of stoppage time to rescue a point for the hosts.\n\n“⁠I had a blast on the boat and at the Southend game,” said Johnston, who hails from Tempe, near Phoenix, and is in London for six weeks as part of his studies. “I had so much fun I plan to go to another Southend game next weekend and hopefully they can pull out the win. ⁠I’m a Southend fan till I die now.

    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "Thibaut Courtois has revealed that Real Madrid are wary of Arsenal’s prowess from set pieces and have been preparing specifically for the challenge of facing them.\n\nThe reigning European champions come into Tuesday’s first leg of their Champions League quarter-final at the Emirates following a 2-1 home defeat by Valencia in La Liga that left them four points behind leaders Barcelona. A poor defensive performance saw Madrid concede their 10th goal from a corner this season, although Carlo Ancelotti will welcome back Courtois and David Alaba from injury against Mikel Arteta’s side.\n\nArsenal have gained a reputation across Europe after scoring 30 times from set pieces since the start of last season and the former Chelsea goalkeeper is aware he must be ready for the challenge.\n\n“We’ve worked on it,” said Courtois. “We know how we have to try to defend against them. The first thing is not to concede too many corners. It’s a matter of concentration, activation – sometimes the quality of the opponent plays a factor too. If the ball arrives perfectly, it’s difficult to defend. But we are ready to do it, we believe that what we have prepared will work out well for us.”\n\nMikel Merino’s goal against Chelsea last month was Arsenal’s 11th of the season from a corner but their first since mid-January. They will also be without Gabriel Magalhães – who has scored 14 of his 16 goals for the club from corners – against Madrid.\n\n“In knockout stages, set pieces usually account for 33% of the goals scored,” said Arteta. “It will be crucial for us, of course, but also for them; they scored against Valencia from a set piece.”\n\nDespite his long list of honours as a manager over a 30-year career that include a record five Champions Leagues, Ancelotti has never won back-to-back domestic league titles. His contract lasts until the end of next season but the Italian has again been linked with the vacant Brazil men’s team post after the sacking of Dorival Júnior last month.\n\nResponding to criticism after the defeat to Valencia, Ancelotti said the decision over his future would be up to president Florentino Pérez and insisted he is determined to end the season with silverware once more.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What can change the dynamic is that the most important person in this club doesn’t get tired. If I didn’t believe that Real Madrid could win all the remaining titles, I wouldn’t be here.

    "title": "Which Trump-supporting billionaires have lost the most in tariff markets turmoil?",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "With global stock markets reeling from Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping border taxes, some of the US president’s business allies have been left counting the cost.\n\nThe world’s 500 richest people lost a collective $536bn (£417bn) in the first two days of stock market trading after Trump’s “liberation day” announcement last Wednesday. It was the biggest two-day loss of wealth ever recorded by Bloomberg’s billionaires index.\n\nWithin that, a coterie of tycoons who have supported Trump or attended his inauguration in January have seen their wealth shrink. Here, we look at the four who have been worst hit by the market turmoil – and one billionaire still riding high this year.\n\nElon Musk The world’s richest man and the chief executive of Tesla – who has already seen his wealth drop precipitously after becoming a high-profile and controversial figure in Trump’s administration – has taken the biggest hit by some margin. Tesla was already facing a potential buyer backlash over its CEO’s controversial behaviour, and as its shares plunged, $31bn was wiped off Musk’s net worth between the opening bell on Thursday and the market closing on Friday. The recent fall in Tesla’s stock has meant his private rockets and satellites business, SpaceX, became his most valuable asset. So far this year, Musk’s estimated wealth has fallen by $130bn, although he still comfortably remains the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $302bn. Tesla’s shares fell nearly 5% on Wall Street on Monday afternoon, adding to these losses.\n\nMark Zuckerberg View image in fullscreen Mark Zuckerberg. Photograph: Manuel Orbegozo/Reuters The Facebook founder and owner of Instagram and WhatsApp had the next biggest loss, at more than $27bn. The world’s third richest person, with an estimated net worth of $179bn, was hit by a plunge in the value of Meta. Its stock dropped almost 14% over two days as the tariff war hit tech companies particularly hard. Its stock edged slightly higher on Monday, up almost 1%. Many of the world’s biggest companies rely on markets in Asia, which had the heaviest tariffs imposed on them by Trump, for manufacturing, computer chips and IT services. Zuckerberg, who performed a remarkable “Trump pivot” of Meta weeks before Trump took office, has seen more than $28bn wiped off his personal fortune so far this year.\n\nJeff Bezos View image in fullscreen Jeff Bezos. Photograph: CraSH/imageSpace/Rex/Shutterstock The Amazon founder and Washington Post owner had the next biggest two-day loss, at $23.5bn. The market value of Amazon, a leading seller of imported goods from around the world, has fallen by hundreds of billions of dollars this year. China-based sellers have more than a 50% market share of Amazon’s third-party marketplace, while its cloud services business also relies on tech produced primarily by manufacturers in Asian countries, such as Taiwan. Bezos, the world’s second richest person, with a net worth estimated at $193bn, has seen $45bn wiped off his fortune so far this year. Amazon’s shares were marginally higher – up 0.4% - on Monday. In February, Bezos’s $10bn climate and biodiversity fund halted funding to one of the world’s most important climate-certification organisations, in a move viewed by some as a “bowing down” to Trump and his opposition to climate action.\n\nBernard Arnault View image in fullscreen Bernard Arnault. Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters The owner of the LVMH luxury goods empire lost $6bn on Thursday and more than $5bn on Friday as Trump’s tariffs hit the Asian factory hubs that underpin the global garment industry. Shares fell even further on Monday, by more than 4%. The net worth of Europe’s richest person, and the fourth wealthiest individual in the world according to Bloomberg, has dropped to $158bn – down $18.6bn so far this year. Arnault has been friends with Trump since the early 1980s when they met at a charity dinner, and the US is his business empire’s largest market, equal in size to all European sales. Arnault, also known as the “wolf in cashmere”, had prime seats at Trump’s second inauguration along with his wife, son and daughter. “I have just returned from the US, and I have witnessed the winds of optimism in that country,” he said on his return. “Coming back to France is a bit like taking a cold shower.” A 20% tariff has since been imposed on the EU, while key countries for garment manufacturing in Asia have tariffs of up to 54%.",

    "title": "What They Found review – Sam Mendes’s debut documentary has the power to change viewers for ever",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "What They Found, the first documentary by the film and theatre director Sam Mendes, is a short, stark shock. The film straightforwardly combines two precious artefacts held at the Imperial War Museum in London: 35mm film, shot by Sgt Mike Lewis and Sgt Bill Lawrie of the British Army Film and Photographic Unit, before and during the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near the town of Celle in northern Germany in April 1945; and audio interviews given by the cameramen in the 1980s. Lewis and Lawrie did not record sound when they visited Belsen; the words they spoke years later are the only sounds we hear.\n\nLewis and Lawrie do not arrive at Belsen until almost halfway through the film’s 36-minute running time. First, laid over generic archive footage, we hear how they came to be army photographers, and we get a flavour of their prewar civilian life. This is particularly pertinent in the case of Lewis, a son of Jewish immigrants from Poland who looked on in dismay in 1936 as fascists held rallies in his parents’ adopted home country. “I could not, like most English Jews, really believe this of England,” he says. “But the world began to assume a shape more real than those things we were taught about it.”\n\nIn April 1945, Lewis and Lawrie converge on Celle, filming devastating destruction caused by aerial bombardment: what used to be streets are now discernible by spotting where the rubble is not heaped quite so high. There they meet a handful of Belsen inmates who have already left the camp and are wandering, unwashed, thin and dazed, but apparently not significantly more damaged than other displaced civilians. On hearing about more “political prisoners” who have just been liberated nearby, Lewis thinks this sounds like a less dangerous assignment than the frontline: the term “political prisoners” strikes him as “a bit vague and rather dull”.\n\nView image in fullscreen Original footage of Bergen-Belsen, shown on What They Found. Photograph: BBC/Imperial War Museums\n\nBy their own admission, Lewis and Lawrie are not prepared for what is inside the camp gates, having only heard rumours about what the Nazis have been doing to Jews and other minorities. A little like viewers of this film who may have read and heard about the Holocaust, but who have not before encountered moving images of the unique terror of Belsen, what Lewis and Lawrie are about to see will change them and stay with them for ever.\n\nFirst, we are shown extreme closeups of corpses, mouths wide open, deaths anything but peaceful. Next, there are bodies, scores of them, face up and face down on the open space between the camp’s buildings, the camera catching juxtapositions of the dead in the foreground and the living behind.\n\nThen come the pictures no one can ever forget. Belsen contained thousands more dead who had to be moved by the truckload to mass graves. Lewis and Lawrie are there as these figures – more shocking because they are naked, more grotesque because starvation has robbed them of a recognisable human shape – are transported to 20ft-deep holes and then thrown, pushed or rolled in, their fragile limbs twisting unnaturally as they fall and join the pile. Lawrie says: “As the days went on, the bodies – they were dummies, they were dolls. You lost contact. Reality went.”\n\nThese few minutes of the film, surely among the most disturbing images ever shown on British TV, are more or less the whole piece: everything on either side is context and, elsewhere, the austerity of the format – if Lewis and Lawrie don’t explain something, it is not explained – can make What They Found slightly perplexing. Existing knowledge or post-viewing research is required to provide details on, for example, why the Nazi camp guards – described with bitter English reserve by Lewis as “arrogant” – are still present, or why the corpses were disposed of in that way, or why the buildings were all firebombed when the liberation was complete.\n\nOften, though, the men find the necessary words. “Why in Germany? What was there about the Germans that made them do this?” muses Lewis, before the tape runs out and the last moments of the film play to blank silence. “The discovery came to me. It was a horrifying discovery. [It was] not only the Germans: any race was capable of it. Anybody, given the circumstances of Germany, could achieve this.”\n\nLewis also talks lucidly about how, despite having been there in person, the camera formed a barrier between him and what he saw. “It pushed the reality of the sights away from me, and protected me.” It is, of course, always the same for us, gazing back from the safety of now. But What They Found forces us to glimpse the clearest and most terrible truth.",

    "title": "US attorney general says Trump likely ‘going to be finished’ after second term",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, has expressed skepticism about the idea of Donald Trump serving a third term in the White House, saying that when her boss’s current presidency ends on 20 January 2029, he is probably “going to be finished”.\n\nBondi’s comments come just a week after Trump gave his most blunt indication yet that he was seriously considering trying for a third term to follow up ones that began in 2017 and this past January – despite the clear prohibition against doing so enshrined in the US constitution.\n\nIn an interview broadcast on 30 March, the US president told NBC News that “I’m not joking” about the idea of a third term, adding: “I like working.” Asked how he could get around what appears to be a watertight two-term cap for any individual president, he said: “There are methods which you could do it.”\n\nBondi’s take on the controversy carries weight because she is the top law enforcement official in the US and also a Trump loyalist whose devotion to the president is unquestioned. She told Fox News Sunday that in her opinion the president was a “very smart man, and we, I wish we could have him for 20 years as our president”.\n\nShe then added: “But I think he’s going to be finished, probably, after this term. We’d have to look at the constitution, and it would be a heavy lift.”\n\nThe two-term limit was set into stone in 1951 with the ratification by the states of the 22nd amendment. It says that “no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice”.\n\nThe restriction was introduced in the wake of Franklin Roosevelt’s unprecedented record of serving three full presidential terms during the second world war. He won a fourth term but died in 1945 just one year into it.\n\nBondi’s comment that it would be a “heavy lift” for Trump to overcome the two-term rule was a reference to what it would take to change the US constitution and revoke the 22nd amendment. Any reform to the text of the constitution requires a two-thirds vote from both chambers of Congress, combined with ratification by three-quarters of the 50 states.\n\nIn today’s highly polarized political world, such a scenario is beyond imagination.\n\nConstitutional change aside, Trump’s cryptic remarks about other “methods” have prompted speculation about his intentions. One tactic that has attracted some attention would be for the vice-president, JD Vance, to run as Republican presidential candidate in 2028, with Trump as his running mate.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a major snag, however.\n\nThe 12th amendment, which lays out procedures for electing both the president and vice-president, states that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States”. The clear implication is that Trump, debarred from running for a third term as president, would equally be debarred from running for vice-president – rendering the ruse null and void.",

    "title": "Arsenal and a 100% success rate giving grounds for optimism against Madrid",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "A REAL TEST\n\nAfter leaving Thomas Partey, Martin Ødegaard, Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Sako on the bench for Arsenal’s match at Everton, Mikel Arteta could scarcely have made it more obvious he had an eye on the Bigger Cup quarter-final first leg with Real Madrid if he’d started with Gunnersaurus, Ty from AFTV and Win the training ground pooch at Goodison Park. As it happened, the players he did pick were in total control until Everton were awarded the kind of weird penalty that will have done little to deter the conspiracy theories of some Arsenal fans who are convinced English officials have an agenda against their club. At least they can go into Tuesday’s match safe in the knowledge that it is being refereed by a more accomplished and less gaffe-prone foreign referee. Specifically, one who prompted outrage by inexplicably ruling out what appeared to be a perfectly good goal scored by RB Leipzig against – oh dear! – Real Madrid in last season’s Big Cup.\n\nWhile few people seem to be giving Arsenal a snowball’s chance in hell against reigning champions fabled for having the survival instincts of cockroaches in a nuclear winter when it comes to staying alive in Bigger Cup, Gunners fans have grounds for optimism. Real Madrid lost at home on Saturday and have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their past eight games, a run in which they have conceded 13 goals. And then there’s the bad news: Kylian Mbappé, Vinícius Junior, Dani Ceballos and Antonio Rüdiger have all been cleared to play, despite fervent Arsenal prayers they might have to sit out the game alongside Aurelién Tchouaméni on an overcrowded Naughty Step following their unseemly celebrations after the shootout win over Atlético. Instead, three of the four players were hit with fines, while Viní Jr was acquitted of the heinous offence of “violating basic rules of decent conduct” when it came to goading fans of their city rivals.\n\nHaving successfully negotiated the Round of Arsenal with a 9-3 aggregate thrashing of PSV, Arteta’s side are likely to find goals more difficult to come by against Real Madrid. Mind you, they do enjoy a 100% success rate in European knockout ties against the 15-times Big/Bigger Cup winners. In 2006, Arsène Wenger’s side eliminated Madrid courtesy of Thierry Henry’s second-leg strike as Arsenal progressed to a final they would ultimately lose against Barcelona due in no small part to an early rush of blood to Jens Lehmann’s famously hot head. They will almost certainly need to score more than a solitary goal across 180 minutes to maintain their imperious record over Madrid, not least because the prospect of Mbappé, Vinícius Junior and Rodrygo bearing down on a makeshift defence featuring a ring-rusty Jakub Kiwior at full speed is enough to give even the most fearsome giant green furry dinosaur night terrors.\n\nTaking on mascot duties of his own, Mikel Arteta implored fans to get to the Emirates sharpish in order to create a special atmosphere – or at the very least, an atmosphere. “I encourage them to come very early to the warm-up and create those nights that we haven’t lived many of at the Emirates,” he roared, as battalions of fans made plans to get to the ground in time to cheer. “We’re going to put in all the ingredients, everything that is in our hands, to play the game we want and take the game in the direction that we want.” Here’s hoping that whatever direction the game ends up going in, those on the journey end up enjoying the big-match experience as much as the hapless American tourist who got on the wrong boat and spent Saturday attending a Southend game by mistake.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\n\nJoin Michael Butler from 8pm (BST) for updates on Leicester City 0-1 Newcastle.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nSunday 6 April: “If we take the long road to come back here, I am ready” – a defiant Ivan Juric says he is already thinking about plotting a way back to the Premier League for Southampton after their relegation with a record seven games left to play.\n\nMonday 7 April: “Ivan came to Southampton at a tough time and was tasked with trying to improve a squad in a difficult situation.

Close observers of Pep Guardiola will know that during the top, top clashes, such as El Clásico, Der Klassiker and City v Liverpool, absolutely every time he’s on camera, Pep is hocking phlegm on to the touchline. It’s as if the mere possibility of a goal causes his juices to flow. For 90 minutes at Old Trafford he did not produce any spittle. Not even the tiniest dribble. All he offered was a half-hearted, resigned flob in injury time.

Even with the grey beard, flat cap, and oversized granddad sunglasses, Cantona looked like he still could do a job as a playmaker without too much effort. Same with the grizzled, haggard, and looming presences of Peter Schmeichel, Roy Keane, etc. glaring at the field. I know, I know that the 90s’ version of United wouldn’t last for a full match against the current generation. But are we sure that they couldn’t get to half-time with a 0-0 scoreline if we had a semi-serious friendly between the sides? Are we?” – Mike Wilner.\n\nSeeing the weed-addled old Wembley stadium looking like a location from some sort of post-apocalyptic zombie film/TV series (Friday’s Memory Lane, full email edition) was disconcerting.

    "content": "Police in the Brazilian state of São Paulo have uncovered that a judge spent 23 years working under a false identity – and a distinctly British one.\n\nBorn José Eduardo Franco dos Reis – a name fairly typical in a country once colonised by Portugal – he entered law school and served for over two decades as a judge using the false name Edward Albert Lancelot Dodd Canterbury Caterham Wickfield.\n\nIn 1995, having just passed the public examination to become a judge, Wickfield claimed in an interview with a Brazilian newspaper that he was the son of English aristocrats, born in Brazil but raised in the UK until the age of 25.\n\nWhat police and public prosecutors are now calling a fraud was only recently discovered and came to the public’s attention following a piece by the news outlet G1.\n\nSince then, Brazilians have been left stunned, trying to grasp how a judge could sustain such an elaborate deception for so long, especially with such an unusual name.\n\nIn October, identifying himself as Wickfield, he visited a government office in São Paulo to renew his ID card.\n\nAll his documents listed his “British” names, but the birth certificate registration number matched that of a Brazilian man named Dos Reis. When police cross-checked the data – and fingerprints – they confirmed it was the same individual.\n\nAccording to what is known so far, Dos Reis began presenting himself as Wickfield in the early 1980s.\n\nPolice say he falsified his birth certificate, entered the University of São Paulo’s law school and began working as a judge in 1995, remaining on the bench until his retirement in 2018.\n\nWhen police uncovered the alleged fraud, he was summoned for questioning. This time identifying himself as Dos Reis, he claimed that Wickfield was his twin brother, given up for adoption as a child to a noble British couple.\n\nHe gave no further explanation for the names, though a piece by the Folha de S Paulo newspaper noted that they appear inspired by literature – such as the Round Table’s Lancelot or Mr Wickfield, the lawyer in Charles Dickens’s David Copperfield.\n\nA public prosecutor charged Dos Reis with identity fraud and using false documents. Court officers have been unable to locate him, so he has yet to be formally summoned to respond.\n\nLast Friday, the São Paulo Court decided to suspend his pension payments as a retired judge – in February alone, he received R$166,413.94 (more than $28,000).",

    "content": "Law firms that cut deals with Donald Trump’s administration after the president issued executive orders targeting attorneys who challenge his priorities are demonstrating “absolute cowardice”, the independent US senator Bernie Sanders has said.\n\n“They’re zillion-dollar law firms, and money, money, money” is all that motivates them, the popular Vermont lawmaker who caucuses with Democrats said in a feature interview on the latest CBS News Sunday Morning. “So they’re going to sell out their souls to be able to make money here in Washington.”\n\nSanders’ remarks provided a notable condemnation of law firms who had represented political rivals of Trump then chose the path of least resistance after he aimed orders that threatened to cripple them. The orders sought to revoke security clearances, ban attorneys from accessing federal buildings, and – if they do business with the government – to force the targeted firm’s clients to disclose existing relationships with them.\n\nSome of the US’s most prominent legal practices subsequently capitulated. Willkie, Farr and Gallagher; Milbank LLP; and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom all reached deals with the White House meant to avoid Trump’s orders.\n\nIn exchange, the firms would perform pro bono work for causes that are dear to them and Trump while also declining to engage in race-based hiring.\n\nSome firms, on the other hand, have sought to stand up to Trump. Perkins Coie got a court injunction blocking much of an executive order from Trump that targeted the firm. Hundreds of law firms and former judges have signed on to court briefs supporting Perkins Coie in its opposition to Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, after suing over Trump orders directed at them, Jenner & Block as well as WilmerHale were able to secure court mandates impeding most of his measures against them.\n\nAlums of the law firms which have yielded to Trump have voiced some of the strongest criticism for choosing that course of action.\n\nOn Sunday, CBS asked Sanders what the cost was to the US when some of its most well-heeled institutions folded in that manner amid a standoff with Trump.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This Week in Trumpland Free newsletter A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He singled out how Trump tasked Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, with slashing the size as well as funding of various federal government agencies and services.\n\nThe multibillionaire owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X landed the role after spending more than $270m supporting Trump’s successful run for the White House in November.\n\n“Look, you get one vote, and Elon Musk can spend $270m to help elect Trump,” Sanders told CBS. “Does that sound like a democracy to you?”",

    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "An Israeli airstrike on a tent camp within a hospital complex in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis has killed 10 people, including a journalist, while seriously injuring dozens more after their encampment caught fire.\n\nImages and video from the courtyard of Nasser hospital in Khan Younis showed people desperately attempting to extinguish the fires as it burned through a row of tents. One video showed people screaming as a bystander attempted to move a burning piece of furniture, while a journalist, later identified as Ahmed Mansour of the news outlet Palestine Today, sat upright engulfed by the blaze.\n\nHis colleague Helmi al-Faqawi was killed in the strike, while at least nine other journalists were among the wounded. Mansour received treatment for severe burns while the photographer Hassan Aslih was reportedly in a stable condition after suffering a head injury and cuts to his right hand.\n\nThe Palestinian foreign ministry in Ramallah said 10 people had been killed in the airstrike, with many more wounded. The ministry called al-Faqawi’s death an act of “extrajudicial killing,” labelling it part of growing crimes against journalists and an attempt to prevent the media from covering events on the ground.\n\nDozens of journalists in Gaza joined al-Faqawi’s relatives to bury the slain reporter in the hours after the attack, placing a blue flak jacket on top of the white shroud covering his body on a stretcher. His killing has brought the number of Palestinian journalists killed since October 2023 to 207, according to the Palestinian foreign ministry in the occupied West Bank.\n\n“We will continue to deliver the message and convey the truth to the whole world. This is our humanitarian duty,” the journalist Abd Shaat told Reuters. He said that the noise of the airstrike had woken them, only for them to see that a nearby tent sheltering their colleagues was on fire.\n\nSince the beginning of Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip hundreds of people have sought shelter in encampments in hospital grounds across the besieged territory, hoping that proximity will provide a measure of safety.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and the Shin Bet security agency said the airstrike on the hospital grounds was targeting Aslih, whom they accused of being a member of Hamas. In a statement, the IDF accused Aslih of taking part in Hamas’s attack on a string of Israeli towns and kibbutzim on 7 October 2023, when 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.\n\nHe took part in the attack by uploading “footage of looting, arson and murder to social media”, the IDF said. Aslih has documented the impact of Israeli attacks on Gaza by uploading photos and video to his Instagram page, followed by 571,000 people.\n\nHis most recent post showed the funeral of the journalist Islam Miqdad, her blue flak jacket also draped across the white shroud over her body, in a burial ritual for journalists. Miqdad was killed in an attack on the building where she was sheltering with her young son in western Khan Younis.\n\n“My daughter is innocent. She had no involvement, she loved journalism and adored it,” Miqdad’s mother Amal Kaskeen told the Associated Press.\n\nLast year was the deadliest on record for journalists, with Israel responsible for 70% of the total deaths of media workers, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Israel’s assault on Gaza claimed the lives of 82 Palestinian journalists in 2024, according to CPJ.\n\nIsrael resumed airstrikes on Gaza after a fragile ceasefire collapsed last month. The UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees said another 142,000 people were displaced in just six days in March after the resumption of fighting.\n\nFifty-nine hostages, including 24 understood to be alive, are still held by militants in Gaza. Israel’s assault on the territory has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in 18 months of war, a third of them children, according to the health ministry in Ramallah.",

    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "Bukayo Saka has said he feels mentally refreshed after missing three months through injury and believes Arsenal are ready to “write our own story” against Real Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final.\n\nSaka is expected to start against Madrid on Tuesday in the first leg for the first time since rupturing a hamstring in December, having come on in the past two matches. The Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, said having the 23-year-old back for what he described as the biggest game of his coaching career was a massive boost as his team attempt to overcome the reigning champions.\n\nSaka, having missed only four of 135 Premier League matches since early May 2021 before his injury, admitted the time on the sidelines had benefited him. “I think mentally it was really good for me,” he said.\n\n“It was really tough initially to find out the extent of my injury, that I was going to have to have surgery … But once it was done and it was successful, I was just focused on coming back stronger and had a lot of time.\n\n“Obviously the past five years I’ve been playing game after game, so it was the first proper break I’ve had and it was really good for me. I got to do a lot of things that I don’t really normally do. I can give you many, many examples, but you will get bored. It’s really nice to be back and I feel fresh mentally for sure.”\n\nArsenal have not faced Madrid since beating them in the last 16 in 2006 when a patched-up side with Mathieu Flamini deputising at left‑back won 1-0 in the Santiago Bernabéu courtesy of a goal from Thierry Henry. With Gabriel Magalhães out for the season, Jakub Kiwior may continue in central defence unless Arteta prefers the fit-again Ben White or Jurriën Timber.\n\nSaka, who insisted he was “pretty relaxed” about signing a new contract with his deal expiring in 2027, revealed he regularly speaks to Henry for advice and is hoping this Arsenal side are capable of following in that one’s footsteps.\n\nAsked whether he had let himself dream about emulating Henry, he said: “Yes, of course. His moment was his moment. Obviously, here we want to write our own story, but something like that would be nice. I want to win and I want to win wearing this badge.\n\n“So I think it’s pretty clear. The fans know how much I love them. You saw when I came on Tuesday [against Fulham], I think they love me back. So it’s a good relationship and I’m really happy to be here and I’m just focused on winning.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Bukayo Saka started as a substitute for Arsenal in the 1-1 draw at Everton.

Building those experiences is something necessary. That’s why I said that we have to build our own story. Because as you said, there is a massive gap there for so many years when nothing has happened in this football club in relation to European competitions. And we need to change that. And we need to change that quickly.”\n\nArsenal look likely to finish as runners-up in the Premier League for the third year in succession having experienced a number of injuries to key players this season. Arteta is hoping it is about time their luck changed and urged his players to seize their moment on the biggest club stage and get to the final like Arsène Wenger’s side did in 2006.\n\n“It’s an inspiration for sure because that generation, what they achieved is what we want to achieve, certainly,” he said. “It’s very different – 20 years is a long time in football, very different context. But the history is there. Unfortunately, it’s too far to be very relative to the situation that we are in. But there are things to take from there and be inspired, for sure.\n\n“We’re going to put all the ingredients, everything that is in our hands, to play the game that we want and to take the game in the direction that we want.”",

    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "A mother and her three children who were taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents as part of a sweep in the tiny hometown of the Trump administration’s “border czar”, Tom Homan, have been released following days of outcry from community figures, advocates and protesters calling for their freedom.\n\nOver the weekend, about a thousand protesters marched outside of Homan’s home in a small New York village, calling for the release of the family after they were detained last month. The family has not been named or spoken out publicly.\n\nJaime Cook, principal of the Sackets Harbor school district where the children reportedly attended class, wrote a letter to the community pleading for the students’ safe return.\n\nShe described the students as having “no ties to criminal activity” and that they are “loved in their classrooms”.\n\n“We are in shock,” the letter reads. “And it is that shared shock that has unified our community in the call for our students’ release.”\n\nThe family was taken into custody in a 27 March raid at a large dairy farm in the remote town that has a population of fewer than 1,500 in Jefferson county in north-western New York state, on Lake Ontario near the Canadian border. The target of the raid was reportedly a South African national charged with trafficking in child sexual abuse material, whom they apprehended, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents said.\n\nBut authorities separately picked up and detained the family, as well as three other immigrants they said were without documentation. The family was moved to the Karnes county immigration processing center, a privately run detention facility in Texas, by 30 March.\n\nCook’s letter said that the family had declared themselves to immigration judges, were attending court on their assigned dates and had been following the legal process.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the children are aged nine, 15 and 18. The New York branch of the advocacy group called the detentions “outrageous” and their release “a huge relief”.\n\nThe release of the family was confirmed on Monday by local officials, school administrators, and the New York governor, Kathy Hochul.\n\nHochul said in a statement that she had direct confirmation from Homan that “this family – a third grader, two teenagers and their mother - are currently on their way back to Jefferson county. I cannot imagine the trauma these kids and their mom are feeling, and I pray they will be able to heal when they return home.”\n\nThe protests were organized with the help of the Jefferson county committee of the Democratic Party. Corey Decillis, committee chair, told NBC News these raids “occur right in the last 60 days across the country, but when it happens in your backyard, I think that’s what garners people’s attention.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The family was subsequently transferred thousands of miles away, to a detention facility in Texas. Today, after mounting public pressure and a historic rally in Sackets Harbor on Saturday, Ice released the family, who are now on their way home.”\n\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union issued its own statement saying the level of “inhumanity and cruelty” in this raid and others like them sends shockwaves through society.\n\n“The outrageous events of the past week do make one thing clear, when people in every corner of New York see the real, human impact of Ice’s cruelty and Trump’s mass deportation machine, they mobilize, speak out and fight back,” the NYCLU’s senior education strategist, Margaret Tso said.\n\nShe added: “At the rally on Saturday in Sackets Harbor, I saw dozens of teachers, families, organizers, and residents from all over marching together, chanting the same thing: ‘Bring this family back home to our community where they belong.’ Families shouldn’t be torn apart, kids shouldn’t be ripped out of class, and people shouldn’t be transported thousands of miles from their home. Trump and Ice must stop terrorizing immigrant families – and New Yorkers must keep fighting back.”\n\nNina Lakhani contributed reporting",

    "title": "Israel military razed Gaza perimeter land to create ‘kill zone’, soldiers say",
    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "Israel’s military razed huge swathes of land inside the perimeter of Gaza and ordered troops to turn the area into a “kill zone” where anybody who entered was a target, according to testimony by soldiers who carried out the plan.\n\nIsraeli combatants said they were ordered to destroy homes, factories and farmland roughly 1km (0.6 miles) inside the perimeter of Gaza to make a “buffer zone”, with one describing the area as looking like Hiroshima.\n\nThe testimonies are some of the first accounts by Israeli soldiers to be published since the latest war started in October 2023 after Hamas’s attack on Israel. They were collected by Breaking the Silence, a group founded in 2004 by Israeli veterans who aim to expose the reality of the military’s grip over Palestinians. The Guardian interviewed four of the soldiers who corroborated the accounts.\n\nTitled “The Perimeter” and published on Monday, the report said the stated purpose of the plan was to create a thick strip of land that provided a clear line of sight for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to identify and kill militants. “This space was to have no crops, structures, or people. Almost every object, infrastructure installation, and structure within the perimeter was demolished,” it said.\n\nSoldiers were “given orders to deliberately, methodically, and systematically annihilate whatever was within the designated perimeter, including entire residential neighbourhoods, public buildings, educational institutions, mosques, and cemeteries, with very few exceptions”, the report added.\n\nThe ultimate result, however, was the creation of “a death zone of enormous proportions”, the report said. “Places where people had lived, farmed, and established industry were transformed into a vast wasteland, a strip of land eradicated in its entirety.”\n\nIt stretches along the frontier with Israel, from the Mediterranean coast in the north to the strip’s south-east corner next to Egypt.\n\nA sergeant in the combat engineers corps said that once an area in the perimeter “was pretty much empty of any Gazans, we essentially started getting missions that were about basically blowing up houses or what was left of the houses”.\n\nThis was the routine, they said: “Get up in the morning, each platoon gets five, six, or seven locations, seven houses that they’re supposed to work on. We didn’t know a lot about the places that we were destroying or why we were doing it. I guess those things today, from my perspective now, are not legitimate. What I saw there, as far as I can judge, was beyond what I can justify that was needed.”\n\nView image in fullscreen An Israeli attack on southern Gaza Strip as seen from behind the border fence inside southern Israel last week. Photograph: Jim Hollander/UPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nSome soldiers testified that commanders viewed the destruction as a way of exacting revenge for the 7 October attacks by Hamas, which sparked the current war when Palestinian militants killed hundreds and kidnapped Israeli and foreign citizens.\n\nWhile Israel says the war is targeted at Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, is fighting allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the international criminal court, including starvation of civilians and “extermination”.\n\nThe IDF did not respond to a request for comment on the report and combatants’ accounts.\n\nOne of the soldiers who provided testimony to Breaking the Silence on condition of anonymity said their unit was told to shoot anyone in the perimeter area on sight. The mentality in their unit, they said, was that there was no such thing as a “civilian” and everyone who walked into the perimeter would be considered a “terrorist”.\n\nRules on who can be killed on sight appeared to vary for different units, according to the accounts.\n\nA sergeant in the armoured corps said that in 2024 he was given “shoot to kill” orders for any male adult who entered the perimeter. “For women and children, [the order was] ‘shoot to drive away’, and if they come close to the fence, you stop [them]. You don’t kill women, children, or the elderly. ‘Shoot to drive away’ means a tank fire,” he said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Israeli troops and tanks deployed near an agricultural field next to the border with the Gaza Strip. Photograph: Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut a captain in an armoured corps unit who operated in Gaza earlier in the war, in November 2023, described the border area as a “kill zone”, saying: “The borderline is a kill zone. Anyone who crosses a certain line, that we have defined, is considered a threat and is sentenced to death.”\n\nAnother captain said there were “no clear rules of engagement at any point” and described a “generally massive use of firepower, especially, like with tanks”. They added: “There was a lot of instigating fire for the sake of instigating fire, somewhere between [wanting to produce] a psychological effect and just for no reason.\n\n“[We] set out on this war out of insult, out of pain, out of anger, out of the sense that we had to succeed. This distinction [between civilians and terrorist infrastructure], it didn’t matter. Nobody cared. We decided on a line … past which everyone is a suspect.”\n\nHow Palestinians would know they were crossing an invisible line was not made clear to them, the soldiers said. “How they know is a really good question. Enough people died or got injured crossing that line, so they don’t go near it.”\n\nBefore the latest war, Israel had previously established a buffer zone inside Gaza that extended to 300 metres, but the new one was intended to range from 800 to 1,500 metres, according to the testimonies.\n\nSatellite imagery has previously revealed the IDF destroyed hundreds of buildings that stood within 1km to 1.2km of the perimeter fence, in a systematic demolishing act that rights groups say may constitute collective punishment and should be investigated as a war crime. Last week, Israel’s defence minister said the military would seize “large areas” in Gaza in a fresh offensive.\n\nThe perimeter accounts for just over 15% of the Gaza Strip, which is entirely off-limits to Palestinian residents. It represents 35% of the strip’s entire agricultural land, according to the report.\n\nDespite shoot-to-kill orders, a warrant officer stationed in northern Gaza said Palestinians kept going back to the area “again and again after we fired at them”.\n\nView image in fullscreen An Israeli army vehicle moves near the border with the Gaza Strip, as seen last week from a position on the Israeli side in southern Israel. Photograph: Amir Levy/Getty Images\n\nThe officer said the Palestinians appeared to want to pick edible plants growing in the area. “There was hubeiza [mallow] there because no one went near there. People are hungry, so they come with bags to pick hubeiza, I think.”\n\nSome got away with their food and their lives, the officer said. “The thing is that, at that point, the IDF really is fulfilling the public’s wishes, which state: ‘There are no innocents in Gaza’.”\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, the same officer said the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 made many Israelis feel the “need to pick up a gun”.\n\n“A lot of us went there, I went there, because they killed us and now we’re going to kill them,” they said. “And I found out that we’re not only killing them – we’re killing them, we’re killing their wives, their children, their cats, their dogs. We’re destroying their houses and pissing on their graves.”",

    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "Extreme volatility plagued global stock markets on Monday, with Wall Street swinging in and out of the red as Donald Trump defied stark warnings that his global trade assault will wreak widespread economic damage, comparing new US tariffs to medicine.\n\nA renewed sell-off began in Asia, before hitting European equities and reaching the US. It was briefly reversed amid hopes of a reprieve, only for Trump to threaten China with more steep tariffs, intensifying pressure on the market.\n\nOn Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 dropped by as much as 4.1% – entering bear market territory after falling more than 20% from its most recent peak, in February – before launching an extraordinary reversal to turn positive.\n\nWhile markets were fleetingly boosted after Kevin Hassett, director of the White House national economic council, signaled that Trump was open to considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries but China, the relief did not last long.\n\nAfter hours of turbulent trading, the S&P closed down 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 0.9%.\n\n“We’re not looking at that,” Trump told reporters, when asked about the prospect of a pause. Pressed on whether the tariffs set the stage for negotiations with countries, or were permanent, he replied: “Well, it can both be true. There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations.”\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% in London at 7,702.08 – the lowest close in more than a year - after the Nikkei 225 slumped 7.8% in Tokyo. Other major European also ended the day sharply lower, including Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC which both fell more than 4%.\n\nTrump, who has previously used market rallies as a barometer of his success, tried to brush off the sell-off this weekend. “I don’t want anything to go down,” the US president said on Sunday. “But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”\n\n1:05 Donald Trump shrugs off tariff turmoil as ‘medicine’ – video\n\nHe stood firm on Monday. “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid!”\n\nAs China prepares to retaliate, Trump threatened to further increase US tariffs on the country – an additional rate of 50% – if it hits back. All talks with Beijing over potential meetings have been “terminated”, he said.\n\nMajor share indices have fallen dramatically since he unveiled his controversial plan to overhaul the US economy last week. The Trump administration imposed a blanket 10% tariff on imported goods this weekend, and is set to follow with higher tariffs on products from specific nations from Wednesday.\n\nWhile senior figures in corporate America have been reluctant to criticize Trump since his inauguration in January, a handful have started to sound the alarm in recent days.\n\nLarry Fink, CEO of the investment giant BlackRock, expressed concern on Monday over the threat of a downturn. “The economy is weakening as we speak,” he said at the Economic Club of New York, according to Bloomberg. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now.”\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase boss, Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, warned that Trump’s tariff plan was “likely” to exacerbate inflation. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.\n\nDimon added: “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.”\n\nThe billionaire fund manager Bill Ackman, who backed Trump’s campaign for the presidency, has also demanded the administration reconsider its plan. “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nEven Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, currently leading the so-called “department of government efficiency” inside the government, appeared to break with the administration on the issue. Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade adviser, “ain’t built shit”, Musk wrote on X, which he owns, this weekend.\n\nNavarro, for his part, insisted in a television interview on Monday morning that the stock market would find a bottom. Less than hour later, when New York opened for trading, the search continued.\n\nThe technology-focused Nasdaq Composite started the day down 4.3%, before switching in and out of the red. It ended the day broadly flat, up by 0.1%. The VIX “fear index” of volatility rose as high as 60 for the first time since August.\n\nOil prices also came under pressure, with Brent and WTI benchmarks stooping to their lowest levels in four years, as growing economic tensions between Washington and Beijing stoked fears that a global downturn would challenge demand.\n\nSir Richard Branson, co-founder of Virgin Group, argued the “predictable and preventable” market chaos would have “catastrophic” implications for people in the US and around the world, and claimed companies were already going bankrupt as a result of the weaker dollar and higher costs.\n\n“This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course,” Branson wrote on X. “Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come.”",

    "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
    "content": "A woman being detained in Arizona by US border patrol for overstaying her visa has died by suicide, according to Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal.\n\nThe woman, a 52-year-old Chinese national, had first been picked up in California after it had been determined that she had overstayed her B1/B2 visitor visa, Jayapal said in a statement. She was later sent to the Yuma station in Arizona where she stayed until her death on 29 March.\n\nThe Tucson Sentinel first reported the woman’s death, saying that border patrol officials did not follow internal policies about publicly acknowledging the death of someone in custody – and then only provided a statement after the Sentinel made inquiries.\n\nYuma sector border patrol reported in a social media post that two people – a 38-year-old man and the woman, both Chinese nationals – had been arrested on 26 March during a vehicle stop near Needles, California. The agents seized more than $220,000 wrapped in aluminum foil in two duffel bags which officials say was the proceeds from unspecified illegal activity.\n\nJayapal said “initial reports” suggest border patrol agents failed to perform required welfare checks prior to the woman’s death.\n\n“When Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents take a person into custody, they are responsible for their well-being, full stop,” Jayapal’s statement read. “This detainee died by suicide, and initial reports have indicated that certain CBP procedures to ensure the safety and welfare of individuals in custody were not conducted.”\n\nJayapal, a ranking member of the House subcommittee overseeing immigration, said that while welfare checks were logged, officials investigating the death could not verify whether the checks had actually happened.\n\n“As the CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) investigates this death, they must provide answers on why these welfare checks were not conducted and falsely recorded, and why this woman was able to die by suicide without any guard intervention,” Jayapal said.\n\nShe further expressed concern for the conditions at detainment facilities amid an immigration crackdown that the second Trump administration has carried out during its first three months in office.\n\nThe congresswoman said reports have consistently shown that the US falls short of its obligations to “treat all detained people with dignity and fairness”.\n\nA border patrol spokesperson told the Tucson Sentinel that the woman was found “unresponsive in a cell” at the Yuma border patrol station on 29 March. Border patrol staff provided medical assistance to the woman before emergency medical services transported her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead, the spokesperson told the Sentinel.\n\n“All in-custody deaths are tragic, taken seriously, and are thoroughly investigated by CBP,” the spokesperson said.",

    "content": "A Danish chef couple who attracted international acclaim with a “forest resort” in Sweden have been tracked down to Guatemala after apparently going on the run from tax authorities, leaving behind 158 barrels of human waste.\n\nFlemming Hansen and Mette Helbæk founded their purportedly eco-friendly retreat, Stedsans, in Halland, southern Sweden, after claiming to have “felt the call of the wild” in Copenhagen, where they ran a popular rooftop restaurant.\n\nStedsans, formed of 16 wooden cottages looking out on to nature, attracted praise from influencers and reviewers, who described it as “magical” and “enchanting luxury”.\n\nBut a few months ago it was discovered that the couple had vanished, leaving multiple animals behind and 158 barrels of human waste, an investigation by newspapers Dagens Nyheter and Politiken has found. It also found that wastewater was left to run into the forest.\n\nView image in fullscreen Guests at Stedsans, which has now shut, were promised an idyllic rural stay. Photograph: Stedsans/Instagram\n\nStaff said multiple animals – including ducks – had died as a result of being left outside through the night by the couple, and others were left abandoned after the owners vanished.\n\nStedsans was declared bankrupt in March and the couple reportedly registered themselves as living abroad before Christmas.\n\nAccording to the investigation, they left the Danish capital, where they owed millions of kroner in debt to Danish tax authorities, in 2016 to move to Sweden. There they set up Stedsans, but started accumulating debt to Swedish tax authorities, which reportedly amounted to 6m SEK (£470,000). They have since started a new hotel business in Guatemala.\n\nIn a message posted on their website, they said: “We came very far with Stedsans, but we also had to realise on the way that being soul-driven entrepreneurs on a mission in a country where taxes are some of the highest in the world and bureaucracy is relentless, it is an impossible task.”\n\nThey added: “When you read this we have probably been declared bankrupt by the Swedish tax authorities. All we ever wanted was to be a part of creating a more beautiful planet.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over 150 barrels of human shit.”\n\nHansen denied any problems with handling animals when approached by the newspaper. He described Swedish tax authorities as a “narcissistic entity” and said he believed he owed them “over 7m” SEK. He also claimed he was now “sentenced to a life in poverty”.\n\nThe Guardian contacted the Danish and Swedish tax authorities. The Danish tax agency said: “We have no comments here subject to confidentiality.” The Swedish tax agency did not comment on the case.\n\nThe Guardian has contacted Hansen and Helbæk for comment.",

    "title": "Trump and DOGE Defund Program That Boosted American Manufacturing for Decades",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "At the height of the US trade war with Japan in the 1980s, Congress established a nationwide network of organizations to advise small American manufacturers on how to survive and grow in what was then a particularly difficult environment. Decades later, there is now at least one Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) center in all 50 states, and they continue to provide taxpayer-subsidized consulting to thousands of businesses, including makers of ovens, printers, tortillas, and dog food.\n\nBut on Tuesday, shortly before the president announced sweeping tariffs on global imports, Trump administration officials informed members of Congress that it was withholding funding for some MEP centers because their work no longer aligns with government priorities.\n\nThe Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which administers the program to help manufacturers, emailed lawmakers to say that it would not be paying out nearly $12.9 million that had been due overall this week to MEP centers in 10 states, according to Democratic staff of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology who spoke on on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“The department is reprioritizing its programmatic activities to ensure that the US secures its position as a leader in critical and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum,” according to the email seen by WIRED. “As such NIST has determined that these cooperative agreements are no longer aligned with the priorities of the department and NIST.”\n\nThe Democratic congressional aides and heads of MEP centers in multiple states believe that abandoning support for the program runs counter to Trump’s long-standing goals of boosting domestic manufacturing and winning the ongoing trade war with China. While the president has demonstrated a preference for punitive measures such as tariffs over subsidies to increase American manufacturing capacity, his defunding of the centers could leave US small businesses without the support they need to take advantage of such policies, advocates for the MEP program say.\n\n“These efforts directly align with the president’s goals to strengthen domestic manufacturing and re-shore production,” says Jennifer Sinsabaugh, CEO of New Mexico MEP.\n\nProject 2025, a proposed road map for the current Trump administration authored by the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, had called for eliminating federal subsidies for the manufacturing program and letting the private sector “more properly” carry out its business advisory services. But as of Wednesday, the Department of Commerce and NIST had not announced a plan to privatize it or shared how the withheld funds would be repurposed.\n\nNIST did not respond to a request for comment. The manufacturing program is one of a number of NIST initiatives that the Commerce Department has moved to scale back or eliminate in recent weeks as Trump and Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency work to dismantle a whole range of long-standing agencies and programs run by the US federal government.\n\nPerhaps anticipating that DOGE might be coming for the program, NIST added a graphic to the top of its MEP webpage in February highlighting how it contributes to the US economy, according to screenshots from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.",

    "title": "Welcome to the Worst Allergy Season Ever",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nThe warming spring air is a welcome relief from the bitterly cold winter across much of the US, but millions of seasonal allergy sufferers are getting buried under a pollen tsunami, with sneezing, headaches, watery eyes, and stuffed sinuses sending them right back indoors.\n\nAlready, Atlanta has broken its pollen count record, with 14,801 grains per cubic meter spewing from pine, oak, and birch trees. Houston also reported its highest pollen counts since 2013, when records began.\n\nThe Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) projects that 2025 will be yet another brutal year for seasonal allergies across the country, with the worst-afflicted cities in the southern US. Your red eyes and runny noses don’t deceive you—seasonal allergies are getting worse, a miserable reality for nearly one in three US adults and one in four children.\n\nWhy? Sneezing and sniffles are some of the sirens of climate change. In fact, because of warming, pollen is now a nearly year-round menace in some parts of the US. Pollen, the main seasonal allergy trigger, is emerging earlier in the year, in higher concentrations, and lasting longer year after year. “In the springtime, the first pollen allergens are from trees, and that is starting 20 days earlier than it did 30 years ago,” said Kenneth Mendez, CEO of AAFA. Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are directly inducing plants to produce more pollen while extending the temperature conditions that trigger pollen production in plants.\n\n“We hear all the time, ‘I’ve never had allergies before, and now I suddenly feel like I have allergies,’ or ‘I feel like my allergies are getting a lot worse,’ and that’s because the allergic load is that much higher because of climate change,” Mendez said.\n\nFor most people, seasonal allergies are an unpleasant nuisance. But with millions feeling blergh at the same time, it adds up to a huge economic burden in lost productivity. Asthma, allergic rhinitis—the condition you probably know of as hay fever—and related allergy conditions cost the economy billions of dollars each year in lost work days, medications, and doctor’s visits.\n\nThere are also people for whom pollen is a more serious problem and can lead to dangerous complications or exacerbate other health issues. One study found that tree pollen allergies lead to 25,000 to 50,000 emergency room visits per year, two-thirds from people under the age of 18.\n\nOver time, as pollen counts increase, more people with a higher sensitivity threshold are finding out the hard way that these tiny grains are a hazard. Other people are also finding out that doors and windows can’t protect them, as some of the tiniest pollen grains seep in.\n\n“If the trend lines continue, I think more people are going to feel miserable from allergies,” Mendez said.\n\nHow We Keep Making Allergies Worse for Ourselves\n\nThe problem for allergy sufferers is that their body’s defense mechanisms sometimes overreact to something benign. Usually, it leads to mild, easily treatable symptoms. But allergens can also trigger more serious complications like asthma attacks, causing wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. In rare cases, they can lead to anaphylaxis, a whole-body reaction where the airways can swell shut and blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels.\n\nThe vast majority of pollen allergies are more annoying than dangerous, but seasonal pollen is so ubiquitous that it’s almost impossible to avoid, sneaking indoors through vents, window seals, on clothing, and in pet fur.",

    "title": "An AI Image Generator’s Exposed Database Reveals What People Really Used It For",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "Tens of thousands of explicit AI-generated images, including AI-generated child sexual abuse material, were left open and accessible to anyone on the internet, according to new research seen by WIRED. An open database belonging to an AI image-generation firm contained more than 95,000 records, including some prompt data and images of celebrities such as Ariana Grande, the Kardashians, and Beyoncé de-aged to look like children.\n\nThe exposed database, which was discovered by security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who shared details of the leak with WIRED, is linked to South Korea–based website GenNomis. The website and its parent company, AI-Nomis, hosted a number of image generation and chatbot tools for people to use. More than 45 GB of data, mostly made up of AI images, was left in the open.\n\nThe exposed data provides a glimpse at how AI image-generation tools can be weaponized to create deeply harmful and likely nonconsensual sexual content of adults and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). In recent years, dozens of “deepfake” and “nudify” websites, bots, and apps have mushroomed and caused thousands of women and girls to be targeted with damaging imagery and videos. This has come alongside a spike in AI-generated CSAM.\n\n“The big thing is just how dangerous this is,” Fowler says of the data exposure. “Looking at it as a security researcher, looking at it as a parent, it’s terrifying. And it's terrifying how easy it is to create that content.”\n\nFowler discovered the open cache of files—the database was not password protected or encrypted—in early March and quickly reported it to GenNomis and AI-Nomis, pointing out that it contained AI CSAM. GenNomis quickly closed off the database, Fowler says, but it did not respond or contact him about the findings.\n\nNeither GenNomis nor AI-Nomis responded to multiple requests for comment from WIRED. However, hours after WIRED contacted the organizations, websites for both companies appeared to be shut down, with the GenNomis website now returning a 404 error page.\n\n“This example also shows—yet again—the disturbing extent to which there is a market for AI that enables such abusive images to be generated,” says Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University in the UK who specializes in online- and image-based abuse. “This should remind us that the creation, possession, and distribution of CSAM is not rare, and attributable to warped individuals.”\n\nBefore it was wiped, GenNomis listed multiple different AI tools on its homepage. These included an image generator allowing people to enter prompts of images they want to create, or upload an image and include a prompt to alter it. There was also a face-swapping tool, a background remover, plus an option to turn videos into images.\n\n“The most disturbing thing, obviously, was the child explicit images and seeing ones that were clearly celebrities reimagined as children,” Fowler says. The researcher explains that there were also AI-generated images of fully clothed young girls. He says in those instances, it is unclear whether the faces used are completely AI-generated or based on real images.",

    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "Try These Magnetic Accessories\n\nMake sure to check out our many MagSafe guides for compatible accessories, but I'll also be adding more to this list since not all MagSafe accessories will work with the Galaxy S25's unique camera placement. If it's a simple, circular accessory, it will likely be OK, but larger square or rectangular magnetic accessories like MagSafe wallets will not fit well.\n\nESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger for $17: We have several great Qi2 magnetic chargers in our Best Wireless Chargers guide but in the interest of ensuring optimal compatibility since the Galaxy S25 camera module may interfere with some magnetic accessories, I can say for certain that this mini Qi2 charger works perfectly. It didn't get too hot, and I like the extra protection added to the area where the cable meets the charging puck. The 5-foot cable is braided.\n\nESR MagSafe AirPlane Phone Holder for $12: This fun little gadget is a phone stand that can clamp onto various surfaces. It folds up and doesn't take much space in a bag, but if you find yourself using your phone a lot on a plane to watch media, you can affix it to the tray table for more ergonomic hands-free viewing. The clamp doesn't extend a ton so it won't work on thick tables, but the magnetic connection is strong and you can tilt the angle quite a bit.\n\nOther Good Screen Protectors\n\nHere are several other screen protectors I've tested. They're all easy to apply, which is the most important thing to look for. There's no point in recommending a screen protector that's hard to install. Remember, you have to re-add your fingerprints after applying the screen protector for biometric authentication to work.\n\nESR Tempered Glass Screen Protector. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nESR Tempered Glass Screen Protector (3 Pack) for $13: Three tempered glass screen protectors for $13? That's shockingly cheap. I kept looking for a catch, but this ESR protector was visually similar to many of the others I've tested and boasts many of the same claims. It's incredibly easy to install—like the Dbrand, you pull a tab once you place the phone in the applicator tool. This ensures perfect installation, and I had zero air bubbles. Unfortunately, it's only available for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, or I'd have recommended it over the pricier Dbrand. It comes with the full cleaning kit, including alcohol wipes, a microfiber cloth, dust removal stickers, and a squeegee. I also tested ESR's Privacy Screen Protector, but I didn't like it: It noticeably affected the screen quality, making it dimmer overall and showing muted colors.\n\nBodyGuardz Pure 3. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nBodyGuardz Pure 3 Screen Protector for $45 (Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, Galaxy S25 Ultra): Kudos to BodyGuardz for being one of the only companies offering a cardboard install tool instead of plastic. Seriously, screen protectors produce so much plastic waste, but this one is minimal. Even the tempered-glass screen protector is made from 30 percent recycled glass. It comes with the usual cleaning kit, and the application was super easy. This one doesn't cover the selfie camera but has a little gap for it, unlike the ESR. Too bad you only get one.\n\nSpigen GlasTR EZ Fit Screen Protector (2 Pack) for $19: Spigen's tempered glass screen protectors are just as easy to install as the others in this list, and come with the usual cleaning tools for prepping your device. I did have a few air bubbles after installation, but they all disappeared minutes later. You get two in this pack.\n\nZagg Glass Elite Camera Lens Protector for $25: I tried three camera lens protectors—from ESR, BodyGuardz, and Zagg—and the application process for each was almost identical. The good thing about the Zagg variant is that it's available for all three Samsung phones, though the ESR protector is most economical. However, you need to be careful when pairing this with a case. These lens protectors are adding a bulky cover to your lens, and that might make it tough for the phone to fit certain cases. If the phone case has an open camera design, then you won't have issues.\n\nMore Cases to Consider\n\nUAG Pathfinder. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nUAG Pathfinder Magnetic Case for $55: I tested a bunch of other UAG cases, from the Monarch Pro and Civilian to the Plyo Pro, but I think the Pathfinder has the best aesthetic, especially in the bright yellow color. The buttons are clicky, there's a magnet embedded in the middle for Qi2 support, and the edges around the screen and cameras are raised fairly well. The case is a bit slippery, but that's my only complaint if you like the loud design.\n\nSpigen Nano Pop MagFit Magnetic Case for $19: It's only available for the Galaxy S25 Ultra right now, but this is a simple magnetic case that's very affordable. It works with Qi2 and Qi chargers, the S Pen is easily accessible, and the buttons are clicky.\n\nBodyGuardz Paradigm Pro Heat-Regulating Magnetic Case for $60: Only available for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, this case is designed to vent heat away from the back of the phone so that there are no hot spots when you're gaming. I've tested this case before for the iPhone and didn't really notice a difference, but what I actually like this case for is the directional bottom speaker—it makes the bottom-firing speakers of the Galaxy S25 Ultra shoot upward to your face when holding the phone, which is actually really nice when gaming in landscape orientation because my grip often blocks the phone's speakers. It also has a built-in lanyard, comes with a magnet for Qi2 charging, and has clicky buttons. The plain black design is boring though, and the material is slippery. I also tested the BodyGuardz Ace Pro, but I found it hard to access the S Pen stylus.\n\nOtterBox Symmetry Ultra-Slim Clear Magnetic Case for $28: A simple clear case with magnets, it's hard not to like this Symmetry case from OtterBox. Buttons are responsive, there are lanyard loops in the corners, and the price is reasonable. I already have a few scuffs on the case that are not coming off, though, which isn't a good sign for longevity.\n\nPitaka PinButton Galaxy S25 Ultra Magnetic Case for $70: Here's a nifty case that tries to do something different. Pitaka's PinButton is a slim case with clicky buttons, accurate port cutouts, and a nice textured feel. It also adds three extra buttons to your Samsung phone. These are configurable buttons, and they work through a combination of NFC and Samsung's Routines. When you take it out of the box, you can tap your phone to the back of the case to get instructions on how to set up the buttons, and they're fairly straightforward. I set up the buttons to trigger Do Not Disturb mode, and another to turn it off. You can be far more creative, though. I have noticed the buttons can sometimes take a few presses to work, but this could just be a delay with NFC.\n\nESR HaloLock Classic Hybrid Case for $20: Only available for the Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25 Ultra right now, this is my second favorite clear case after the Dbrand recommendation above. The material feels nice, smudges are easy to wipe away, and it has built-in magnets. I can confirm it works on my Qi2 as well as my basic Qi charger. The buttons are responsive, and it's easy to access the S Pen stylus.\n\nMous Clarity 3.0 Magnetic Case for $70: This is a solid clear case (available for the entire S25 series), though it was already scuffed a little when I unboxed it, which doesn't bode well for how it will look after months of use. Especially considering how much the case costs. It does have magnets for Qi2 charging and is an otherwise perfectly fine case.\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nMous Super Thin 2.0 Magnetic Case for $55: If you hate bulky cases, I recommend Mous' Super Thin 2.0 case. Thin polycarbonate cases like this aren't protecting your phone from serious drops, but they'll take care of everyday scratches and scuffs just fine. Mous' version has a slick design, and the edges around the display and cameras are ever-so-slightly raised. It has built-in magnets and worked well on my Qi2 charger as well as my basic Qi charging stand. The buttons are responsive, and it's easy to reach for the S Pen stylus on the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nTech21 EvoArmor and EvoClear Magnetic Cases for $50: These are some solid, simple, and smart-looking magnetic cases with Qi2 functionality. The edges around the screen are raised to protect it, the buttons are responsive, and there's a spot to attach the lanyard. The Evolite is a solid clear case if that's what you're looking for, though I prefer the Dbrand and ESR to it. I also tested the EvoLite case, which is very basic and doesn't have magnets if you want something simple. but it's a bit slippery.\n\nSamsung Standing Grip Phone Case for $37: I like the big grip on the back of this case. It slides nicely and you can fit several fingers through it. However, the plastic sides of the case feel a little out of place and make it feel cheap. The edges around the screen are also barely raised, so it doesn't feel very protective. Surprisingly, wireless charging works, though there are no magnets here, so you don't get Qi2 support. The bottom edge is also weirdly not protected.\n\nSamsung Silicone Case for $30 and Rugged Case for $60: Samsung's official Silicone case does the job, but I'm not sure what it does more than the cheaper options above. The same goes for the Rugged Case, which is way too expensive for what you get, especially considering there are no magnets in either of these for Qi2 support. They're functional cases, just too expensive.\n\nSpeck Presidio Perfect-Clear and Presidio2 Grip Magnetic Cases for $50: These cases check off all the boxes in terms of functionality, and they're a little more interesting to look at. They also have magnets for Qi2 support. However, both of them just feel a bit cheap—the Presidio2 Grip specifically has these cheap-looking plastic accents on the corners that ruin the aesthetic. Then again, I'm also nitpicking.\n\nLatercase Thin Case. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nLatercase Thin Case for $59: Here's another super-thin case for people who hate traditional bulky cases. It's made from aramid fibers and will keep your phone scratch-free (at least, the back of it). There's no protection for the bottom edge, the buttons, or the top edge, so it's quite minimal. I like the soft texture of the material though, and it looks pretty. There are sadly no magnets for Qi2 functionality. The good news is that unlike many thin cases I've tested, this one is very easy to remove.\n\nZagg Santa Cruz Snap Magnetic Case for $50: I tested several cases from Zagg, including the Luxe, Milan, Denali, and Crystal Palace with Kickstand. They're all OK. The buttons on all of these are slightly stiffer than on the other cases I've tested—not terrible, but just enough to notice. Many of these don't have magnets in them, but the Santa Cruz Snap does, and it worked well on my Qi2 and Qi charger. The edges are grippy, which is why I like it.\n\nBenks ArmorAir Case for $40: This case is another ultra-thin case, but it's made from Kevlar fiber, though how much durability that provides when it's this thin is questionable. What bugs me is that the camera module shifts ever so slightly. It's one of those things that once you notice, you won't stop feeling and seeing it shift every time. At least it covers more edges than the Latercase, and it also has magnets built in for Qi2 support.\n\nCasetify Impact Magnet Cases for $74: You can get Casetify's Impact cases in any style—with a mirror finish, a clear finish, or a crazy design. These are solid magnetic cases with clicky buttons, decently raised edges, and a good grip. The ring around the camera module is a bit thick though and disrupted charging on my Qi charger on occasion, but not consistently. That shouldn't be much of an issue if you use a Qi2 charger.\n\nPhotograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nUAG Plasma XTE Kickstand Case for $70 (Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra): The Plasma XTE is a nice kickstand case. UAG's cases are kind of like G-Shock watches—they're big and bold, but attractive in their own way. They're not designed for minimalists, but I've come to enjoy the aesthetic. The kickstand can keep the phone propped up in both landscape and portrait orientation, and it has magnets built into it—it recharged on my Qi2 charger without fail. However, it did not work on my Qi charger, so keep that in mind if you haven't upgraded your wireless charger yet. It otherwise checks off all the boxes with raised edges around the display and cameras, responsive buttons, and an easily accessible S Pen cutout on the S25 Ultra model.\n\nOtterBox Symmetry Cactus Leather Case for $60: This is a good-looking leather-like case, except it's made of cactus leather by a company called Desserto. While that might sound more sustainable than real leather, there's still a lot of polyurethane in these cases. This isn't the sustainable case you were looking for. Still, it offers solid protection and responsive buttons while mimicking the leather aesthetic. There are no magnets, so that means no Qi2 support. I also tested the Symmetry Soft Touch, another non-magnetic case. It's OK, just not good value.\n\nRokform Rugged Case for $70: I would only recommend this case to anyone who really wants the strongest magnets. This bulky case is protective, but in the middle around the magnetic ring sits a little removable puck. By default, this puck is magnetic and increases the magnet strength so that you have a more secure connection. However, this magnetic puck also disables all wireless charging. When you want to wirelessly charge, you have to replace the puck with the included non-magnetic puck, and then Qi2 charging will work. It didn't work on a basic Qi charger at all. It's very protective with edges raised well above the display, and the buttons are clicky, but it's a bit much.\n\nSpigen Tough Armor MagFit for $19: I've tested this case for various phones over the years and I still can't believe how flimsy the kickstand is. It continues to only work in landscape mode, meaning you can't prop your phone up to watch TikTok videos. It's an otherwise adequate case that's affordable, but really, it's time to make a change.\n\nAvoid These Cases and Accessories\n\nZagg XTR4 Screen Protector. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nZagg Fusion Privacy Anti-Glare Screen Protector: You're supposed to peel one side of the screen protector before installing it, but this side was stuck to the protector so it took some effort. This ended up ruining the other side a bit, causing several air bubbles when I finally was able to install it. Worse yet, this privacy protector performs poorly. Yes, you can't see what's on the screen from the side, and the matte screen reduces glare, but it also greatly affects the screen's image quality, with muted colors and low resolution.\n\nZagg XTR4 and Fusion XTR4 Screen Protectors: Zagg claims these are graphene-fortified for better protection, and that might be true, but when you can get screen protectors for as little as $13, it's hard to make a case for a $60 one. The application tool isn't as hassle-free as cheaper models I've tested, and Zagg only includes one protector. It could save your phone from a crack, but I'll take my chances with the protectors we recommend above.\n\nOtterBox Premium Glass Screen Protector: You only get one tempered glass protector here, which isn't great value for money. But that's not why I didn't like it as much as our other recommendations. You have to affix the screen protector to the top of the installation tool before you begin, but it wasn't staying in place, and the tiny bit of fidgeting to get it hooked up was enough to introduce some dust on the screen, which naturally I did not see until after I finished installing the screen protector. The application itself was precise and I had no air bubbles, but there are plenty of other easy-to-apply screen protectors that don't cost this much.\n\nCasetify Impact Stand Ring Case: This case does not work with the Qi wireless charger because the module around the camera is too thick. This module is a secret kickstand, but one new feature shouldn't cancel out the other.",

    "title": "An IVF Alternative Could Make Having Babies Less Onerous",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "More and more people are turning to in vitro fertilization, or IVF, to have babies. The process can be arduous, requiring injections of costly hormones twice a day for two weeks to mature eggs so that they can be retrieved from the body.\n\nNew York startup Gameto is aiming to ease this burden for patients by maturing eggs outside the body instead. The company’s method replaces 80 percent of the hormone injections needed for traditional IVF, shortening the length of a treatment cycle to a few days. It’s showing promise at generating healthy embryos and pregnancies, according to new data released by the company.\n\nMaturing eggs in a lab instead of in the ovaries isn’t a new idea. In vitro maturation, or IVM, emerged in the 1990s, but the technique isn’t widely used because it has lower success rates than IVF. During IVM, eggs are extracted and grown in a special concoction of nutrients and growth factors. With Gameto’s approach, eggs are ripened with ovarian “support” cells derived from stem cells.\n\nIn a preprint posted online, Gameto showed that its product, dubbed Fertilo, led to higher pregnancy rates than conventional IVM. In the first part of the study, an initial 20 patients received Fertilo to evaluate the safety of the technique. In the second part, 20 more patients were randomized to receive either Fertilio or IVM. Eggs matured with Fertilo were more likely to develop normally, with a 70 percent maturation rate compared to 52 percent using standard IVM.\n\nWhen these eggs were then fertilized with sperm, Fertilo resulted in more viable embryos and a higher pregnancy rate—44 percent of patients in the Fertilo group got pregnant after one treatment cycle, while 20 percent who underwent IVM did. To date, the study has led to 15 ongoing pregnancies, 13 from Fertilo treatment and two from IVM. One patient in the Fertilo group became pregnant naturally after egg retrieval and was not included in the final analysis. The study, which was carried out in Mexico and Peru, has not yet been peer-reviewed.\n\n“The idea of Fertilo is to bring a patient-centric solution, one that is truly empowering and makes it a lot easier for people to build a family,” says Dina Radenkovic, Gameto’s CEO and founder. Radenkovic actually tested Gameto’s technology on her own eggs—not to get pregnant, but to see how well Fertilo did at maturing them.\n\nThe ovaries naturally produce one mature egg a month until menopause. In an IVF cycle, patients self-inject high doses of hormones for 10 to 14 days to spur their ovaries into producing many of them. The shots cause mood swings, headaches, bloating, and, in rare cases, a painful and potentially serious condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. In the US, stimulation meds range between $4,000 and $7,000 per treatment cycle, which can amount to a third of the total cost of IVF. And many patients need a few cycles to get pregnant.\n\nWith Gameto’s method, patients take an initial two to three days of hormones, then undergo egg retrieval. The eggs are incubated with ovarian support cells for about 30 hours. Gameto has developed a way to engineer these specialized reproductive cells from stem cells. “We’re able to utilize these cells to recreate the ovary outside the body,” says Christian Kramme, Gameto’s chief scientific officer.",

    "title": "'Wi-Fi Keeps Going Down': Donald Trump's Return-to-Office Mandate Is Going Terribly",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "Since President Donald Trump mandated that remote and partially remote federal workers all must return to their offices, thousands of employees across the country have been figuring out how to navigate new commutes, seating arrangements, and a lack of supplies as basic as toilet paper and legal pads while still getting their work done.\n\nOne effect of all this, many federal employees tell WIRED, is that they are traveling long distances to spend all of their time in virtual meetings.\n\n“I don’t directly work with anyone in the office that I am going into,” one employee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development tells WIRED. “So I show up and sit on [Microsoft] Teams calls.”\n\nA Treasury employee says they spend most of their time at the office on video calls as well, “because of people working at other sites … and that’s hard when working from a cubicle. I definitely get less done because of the distractions.”\n\nAt the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one employee says that the focus on the return-to-office mandate has meant a lot of chaos for people who actually need to do their jobs in person. “Some teams and groups aren’t even on the same campuses because space was so limited. So they’re coming to work just to sit on the same virtual meetings as always,” they say. “And all the chaos has made it more difficult for the lab people, who actually need to be on campus. I’d say with everything they get two-to-three hours less of meaningful work out of me each day.”\n\nOver the past few months, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has upended the government. In addition to firing tens of thousands of federal employees, before being forced by judges to rehire some of them, return-to-office mandates have resulted in chaos. Outlets like CNN and Reuters reported on the initial confusion and disarray caused by forcing tens of thousands of employees back to the office all at once, but weeks later, employees say the situation is getting worse.\n\nThough Trump and Musk have claimed the mandate would result in huge productivity increases and financial savings, more than 30 federal employees at 17 federal agencies tell WIRED the return-to-office order has resulted in widespread chaos, plummeting productivity, and significantly reduced services to the public. It isn’t just traveling to work to sit on Zoom calls—it’s that there may be no place to take the call or no working internet to connect to it. WIRED granted employees anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, which some say are affecting their physical and mental health—and nearly all say are resulting in a lower quality of work and worse public services.\n\n\"The workplace environment is unpleasant, loud, people talk about whatever they want, and the workload is insane with the mass layoffs and hiring freeze,\" an employee at the Department of Defense (DOD) tells WIRED. \"This is a terrible place to work.\" The employee says they cry almost every day after leaving the office.",

    "title": "Review: SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini Gen 3",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "The SteelSeries Apex Pro Mini Gen 3 is one of the few Hall effect keyboards with a true 60% layout today, and if nothing else, that makes it special. I’ve long been a proponent of the 60% keyboard. It’s by far the smallest keyboard layout that’s still accessible, and it encourages extensive use of function layers, a skill that can make your typing more efficient. A 60% keyboard can save desk space, is more efficient, and is also portable if you want to take it to the office.\n\nEvery new Hall effect keyboard has a few things in common: They all use roughly the same switches and have similar technical specs. The real differentiating factors of these keyboards are the layout and tactile experience of using them. This is where the $220 Apex Pro Mini both succeeds and falls short. The layout and design are great, but the experience of using this keyboard doesn’t feel up to par with its competitors.\n\nPhotograph: Henri Robbins\n\nSmooth Switch\n\nThe latest generation of the Apex Pro Mini uses the OmniPoint 3.0 switch, a fully adjustable Hall effect switch manufactured by Gateron for SteelSeries. Most Hall effect switches, including those in Wooting, Keychron, and Corsair keyboards, are manufactured by Gateron with the same general construction and only small differences between each brand’s version of the switch. (I go into depth about Hall effect switches here.)\n\nThe OmniPoint 3.0 switch uses a dual-rail design meant to increase stability and reduce the side-to-side wobble of individual keys. On a standard mechanical switch, the internal sliding mechanism (the stem) has a thick rail on either side that guides the vertical movement of a keypress. On a dual-rail switch, this singular rail on the stem is replaced with two thinner ones, and an additional tab on the switch’s housing sits between them. This all works together, in theory, to increase the tolerances of the switch without adding friction or scratchiness to the keypress.\n\nPhotograph: Henri Robbins\n\nIn practice, I find the difference between this system and a standard rail minimal. With modern material science and factory lubrication, both can be incredibly smooth, and the amount of wobble when typing is going to be small on any decent-quality switches. However, I have found that the typing sound from dual-rail Hall effect switches is marginally more “crisp” than single-rail Hall effect switches, which tend to be a bit dull and lacking in the top end of their sound profile.",

    "title": "Federal Judge Allows DOGE to Take Over $500 Million Office Building for Free",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "On Tuesday, US district judge Beryl Howell effectively allowed the transfer of the headquarters building of the United States Institute of Peace to the General Services Administration.\n\nIn fact, the building—and all of the property inside it—had already been transferred on Saturday, according to Howell’s ruling. “The deal is no longer merely ‘proposed’ but done,” Howell wrote, “rendering plaintiffs’ requested relief moot as to that property.”\n\nGeorge Foote, longtime outside general counsel to USIP, says he found that reasoning perplexing. “That’s like letting a burglar break into your house, steal your TV, and have the court say well, there’s no TV to adjudicate, so I can’t do anything about it,” he claims.\n\nThe building, with an estimated value of $500 million, has become the latest focal point in a weeks-long standoff between former institute board and staff and members of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. On March 14, the Trump administration fired the USIP’s 10 voting board members. When USIP staffers barred DOGE employees from entering their headquarters in Washington, DC, the DOGE team returned a few days later with a physical key they had gotten from a former security contractor.\n\nThe takeover was both physical and institutional. Former State Department official Kenneth Jackson was installed as USIP president, then replaced on March 25 by DOGE staffer Nate Cavanaugh, who had previously been assigned to the General Services Administration. By last Friday evening, most USIP staffers had received termination notices, effectively shuttering the agency.\n\nThe fight over the building came to light Monday through court documents in a lawsuit filed by former USIP staffers against Cavanaugh, DOGE, Donald Trump, and other members of the administration. They reveal not only that Cavanaugh recently moved to transfer the building to GSA, but that he planned to do so at no cost to the government.\n\nIn a letter included in the court’s docket, Cavanaugh tells GSA acting administrator Stephen Ehikian that the transfer “is in the best interest of USIP, the federal government, and the United States.” In a separate letter, dated March 29, Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought approved Ehikian’s request to “set the amount of reimbursement at no cost” for the facility.\n\nA previously unreported court filing from Monday speaks to the Trump administration’s justification for trying to acquire the building.\n\n“The transfer of the U.S. Institutes [sic] of Peace (USIP) headquarters facility … is a priority of the Trump-Vance administration,” wrote the GSA’s Michael Peters, who spent nearly a decade running a dental practice management company before he was named commissioner of the Public Buildings Service in January, in a transfer request form. “The transfer will enable GSA to fulfill other governmental space requirements at the USIP headquarters facility in a cost-effective manner. However, GSA has not had adequate time to budget for the cost of acquiring the USIP headquarters facility at fair market value, nor would such an acquisition be an immediate priority for GSA, given the limited resources available in the Federal Buildings Fund.”",

    "title": "The Best Wireless Earbuds for Everyone",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "Other Earbuds We Like\n\nEvery month seems to bring new sets of earbuds with longer battery life, new features, and more compact designs. As such, we can't list everything we like. But if you're still hunting, here are some other recommendations.\n\nBeyerdynamic Amiron 300 for $280: These premium earbuds from Beyerdynamic (8/10, WIRED Recommends) look nondescript and sound fantastic, but they lack any of the superlative qualities of the buds on the list above. If you're after a clean-looking pair of headphones with fantastic vocal definition, they're worth considering.\n\nSoundcore Space A40 for $60: While they're no longer on our main list, the Space A40 are still some of my favorite buds for the money, providing good features, clear sound, and excellent noise canceling for their price class. They also look polished, with only their lack of auto-pause sensors betraying their low price.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for $100-200: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are getting older, but they're still among the best buds to pair with a Samsung phone. They don't have the multi-device connectivity of our top pick for Android users, and their five-hour battery is looking pretty short these days, but they provide excellent sound quality, IPX7 waterproofing, and a distinctive design that doesn't just ape the AirPods Pro. That makes them well worth considering on sale.\n\nPixel Buds A Series for $99: These used to be our top pick for most people, but they're now overshadowed by other affordable options that also include things like noise canceling. If you can find a pair on sale, they're still worth snagging, especially if you have an Android phone.\n\nSoundpeats Air4 for $76: Soundpeats’ Air4 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) may be obvious AirPods Pro knockoffs, but they're very good knockoffs for the money. You won't get top-flight performance, let alone Apple exclusives like Find My support or iCloud sharing, but you will get good sound and features, including decent noise canceling, at a massive discount. While these aren't a top choice, they're a great budget buy, especially on sale.\n\nSony Linkbuds Fit for $200: Sony’s Linkbuds Fit offer rich and punchy sound, naturalistic transparency mode, and a light and comfy fit, helping them live up to their intent as a “wear anywhere” solution. They provide some solid features, but skimp on battery life with just 5.5 hours per charge, and their noise canceling is just OK. Their oddly unresponsive touch controls and reliance on flimsy silicone sleeves further diminish their value, but they're still Sony buds and could be worth nabbing on a good sale.\n\nMontblanc MTB 03 for $395: These earbuds are priced out of reach for most buyers, but if you've got the cash, you'll be rewarded with a luxury experience worthy of the brand. Montblanc has called in some heavy hitters from the audio industry to design and voice these buds. The result is a small, comfortable, and quite flashy-looking pair of wireless earbuds that sound really impressive.\n\nRaycon Everyday Earbuds for $80: These YouTuber-beloved earbuds are actually a decent cheap pair (7/10, WIRED Review). They are small and light, and they come with an IPX6 rating, which makes them great for workouts.\n\nMaster & Dynamic MW08 Sport for $399: The Sport are a great option that come with active noise canceling and a striking design, but the high price keeps them out of the reach of most people.\n\nEarbuds to Avoid\n\nAs a general rule, you should avoid earbuds that don't support the Bluetooth 5.0 standard (or higher) or don't offer at least five hours of battery life, and more like six these days. Batteries in wireless headphones degrade over time, so the better your battery life is at first, the more tolerable it will be in two to three years.\n\nApple's standard AirPods (previous or current gen) for $119-170: These headphones do some things well, we just don't like them all that much. (Read our latest review.) They get OK battery life, come in a compact case, and work well for calls, but they don't fit all ears well, and since they don't have ear tips or wings, you're out of luck if they're loose. The priciest model adds noise canceling which works about as well as you'd expect for a pair that doesn't offer a proper seal. Want clear music, good noise canceling, and advanced features made for iPhones? Get the AirPods Pro Gen 2, which sometimes cost more (and sometimes less) but are legitimately great.\n\nBeats Solo Buds for $80: These are lackluster in virtually every possible way (6/10, WIRED Review), especially when it comes to features for the money. Their best traits are their micro-size and big battery, but that's about it. It's odd, because we like other headphones from the brand, but these just don't keep pace. The best we can say is they are cheap.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 for $180: A Cybertrucked pair of AirPods clones (5/10, WIRED Review), the headphones in the new Galaxy Buds line work worse than they already look. With no eartips, these are uncomfortable to wear for long periods, and the noise canceling is all but useless.",

He scrawls charts with swooping hockey-stick curves that show how machine intelligence is bending toward the infinite. His hand rises to his curly mop of hair, as if he’s caressing his neurons to forestall a system crash. You can almost feel his bones vibrate as he explains how his company, Anthropic, is unlike other AI model builders. He’s trying to create an artificial general intelligence—or as he calls it, “powerful AI”—that will never go rogue. It’ll be a good guy, an usher of utopia. And while Amodei is vital to Anthropic, he comes in second to the company’s most important contributor.

Hi, Claude!\n\nAmodei has just gotten back from Davos, where he fanned the flames at fireside chats by declaring that in two or so years Claude and its peers will surpass people in every cognitive task. Hardly recovered from the trip, he and Claude are now dealing with an unexpected crisis. A Chinese company called DeepSeek has just released a state-of-the-art large language model that it purportedly built for a fraction of what companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic spent. The current paradigm of cutting-edge AI, which consists of multibillion-dollar expenditures on hardware and energy, suddenly seemed shaky.\n\nAmodei is perhaps the person most associated with these companies’ maximalist approach. Back when he worked at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal paper on something he’d mulled for years: a hypothesis called the Big Blob of Compute. AI architects knew, of course, that the more data you had, the more powerful your models could be. Amodei proposed that that information could be more raw than they assumed; if they fed megatons of the stuff to their models, they could hasten the arrival of powerful AI. The theory is now standard practice, and it’s the reason why the leading models are so expensive to build. Only a few deep-pocketed companies could compete.\n\nNow a newcomer, DeepSeek—from a country subject to export controls on the most powerful chips—had waltzed in without a big blob. If powerful AI could come from anywhere, maybe Anthropic and its peers were computational emperors with no moats. But Amodei makes it clear that DeepSeek isn’t keeping him up at night. He rejects the idea that more efficient models will enable low-budget competitors to jump to the front of the line. “It’s just the opposite!” he says. “The value of what you’re making goes up. If you’re getting more intelligence per dollar, you might want to spend even more dollars on intelligence!” Far more important than saving money, he argues, is getting to the AGI finish line. That’s why, even after DeepSeek, companies like OpenAI and Microsoft announced plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more on data centers and power plants.\n\nWhat Amodei does obsess over is how humans can reach AGI safely. It’s a question so hairy that it compelled him and Anthropic’s six other founders to leave OpenAI in the first place, because they felt it couldn’t be solved with CEO Sam Altman at the helm. At Anthropic, they’re in a sprint to set global standards for all future AI models, so that they actually help humans instead of, one way or another, blowing them up. The team hopes to prove that it can build an AGI so safe, so ethical, and so effective that its competitors see the wisdom in following suit. Amodei calls this the Race to the Top.\n\nThat’s where Claude comes in. Hang around the Anthropic office and you’ll soon observe that the mission would be impossible without it. You never run into Claude in the café, seated in the conference room, or riding the elevator to one of the company’s 10 floors. But Claude is everywhere and has been since the early days, when Anthropic engineers first trained it, raised it, and then used it to produce better Claudes. If Amodei’s dream comes true, Claude will be both our wing model and fairy godmodel as we enter an age of abundance. But here’s a trippy question, suggested by the company’s own research: Can Claude itself be trusted to play nice?\n\nOne of Amodei’s Anthropic cofounders is none other than his sister. In the 1970s, their parents, Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei, moved from Italy to San Francisco. Dario was born in 1983 and Daniela four years later. Riccardo, a leather craftsman from a tiny town near the island of Elba, took ill when the children were small and died when they were young adults. Their mother, a Jewish American born in Chicago, worked as a project manager for libraries.",

    "title": "President Trump’s War on ‘Information Silos’ Is Bad News for Your Personal Data",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "Dizzied by an accumulated pileup of busted norms, you might have missed a presidential executive order issued on March 20. It’s called, “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos.” It basically gives the federal government the authority to consolidate all the unclassified materials from different government databases. Compared to eviscerating life-sustaining agencies in the name of fighting waste and fraud, it might seem like a relatively minor action. In any case, the order was overshadowed by Signalgate. But it’s worth a look.\n\nThis is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.\n\nAt first glance, the order seems reasonable. Both noun and verb, the very word silo evokes waste. Isolating information in silos squanders the benefits of pooled data. When you silo knowledge, there’s a danger that decisions will be made with incomplete information. Sometimes expensive projects are needlessly duplicated, as teams are unaware that the same work is being done elsewhere in the enterprise. Business school lecturers feast on tales where corporate silos have led to disaster. If only the right hand knew what the left was doing!\n\nMore to the point, if you are going to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse, there’s a clear benefit to smashing silos. For instance, what if a real estate company told lenders and insurers that a property was worth a certain amount, but reported what were “clearly…fraudulent valuations,” according to a New York Supreme Court judge. If investigative reporters and prosecutors could pry those figures out of the silos, they might expose such skulduggery, even if the perpetrator wound up escaping consequences.\n\nBut before we declare war on silos, hold on. When it comes to sensitive personal data, especially data that’s held by the government, silos serve a purpose. One obvious reason: privacy. Certain kinds of information, like medical files and tax returns, are justifiably regarded as sacrosanct—too private to merge with other records. The law provides special protections that limit who can access that information. But this order could force agencies to hand it over to any federal official the president chooses.\n\nThen there’s the Big Brother argument—privacy experts are justifiably concerned that the government could consolidate all the information about someone in a detailed dossier, which would itself be a privacy violation. “A foundational premise of privacy protection for any level of government is that data can only be collected for a specific, lawful, identifiable purpose and then used only for that lawful purpose, not treated as essentially a piggy bank of data that the federal government can come back to whenever it wants,” says John Davisson, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.\n\nThere are practical reasons for silos as well. Fulfilling its mission to extract tax revenue from all sources subject to taxes, the IRS provides a payment option for incomes derived from, well, crookery. The information is siloed from other government sources like the Department of Justice, which might love to go on fishing expeditions to guess who is raking in bucks without revealing where the loot came from. Likewise, those not in the country legally commonly pay their taxes, funneling billions of dollars to the feds, even though many of those immigrants can’t access services or collect social security. If the silo were busted open, forget about collecting those taxes. Another example: the census. By law, that information is siloed, because if it were not, people would be reluctant to cooperate and the whole effort might be compromised. (While tax and medical data is considered confidential, the order encourages agency heads to reexamine information access regulations.)",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Professor Faced China-Funding Inquiry Before Disappearing, Sources Say",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "Before the official faculty profiles of renowned Indiana University, Bloomington (IU) data privacy professor Xiaofeng Wang and his wife disappeared and the FBI raided two of the couple’s homes last week, the school is said to have been reviewing for months whether the professor received unreported research funding from China, WIRED has learned.\n\nIndiana University contacted Wang in December to ask about a 2017-2018 grant in China that listed Wang as a researcher, according to an unsigned statement that appears to be written by a Purdue University professor and long-time collaborator of Wang seen by WIRED. The statement says that the author believed IU was concerned that Wang allegedly failed to properly disclose the funding to the university and in applications for US federal research grants.\n\nThe statement has been circulating among cybersecurity and privacy scholars at universities around the world in recent days and was sent to WIRED by three separate sources. It claims that Wang had explained the funding situation to IU, then was told in February that the school would continue looking into the matter.\n\nAlex Tanford, a professor emeritus at Indiana University and the IU Bloomington Chapter president of the American Association of University Professors, says Wang reached out to him and said that he had been accused of alleged research misconduct. Tanford says he provided Wang guidance as a member of the faculty board of review. IU did not answer WIRED’s questions regarding any probes into Wang.\n\n“The charge seemed trivial—that he had failed to properly disclose who was principal investigator on a grant application and had not fully listed all his coauthors on an article,” Tanford tells WIRED of the allegations. He says Wang wanted to know if the university had the right to lock him out of his office and computer, as he was in the middle of ongoing research.\n\nResearch papers Wang published between 2017 and 2018 list funding from places like the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the US Army Research Office, Google, and Samsung, according to a WIRED review of his publications from the time period.\n\nWang regularly collaborated with researchers at the Institute of Information Engineering (IIE) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a government-funded cybersecurity research lab. In papers, Wang and his coauthors disclosed that the IIE scholars received funding from sources such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China, but that Wang was being supported by US grants. It’s not uncommon for professors at US institutions to collaborate with researchers in China, and there's no public evidence to suggest that the arrangements were improper.\n\nAccording to the unsigned statement’s title and metadata, it appears to have been authored by Ninghui Li, a computer science professor at Purdue who has collaborated on research with Wang since at least 2006. The pair also serve together on the board of the ACM Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control (SIGSAC), which aims “to develop the information security profession by sponsoring high quality research conferences and workshops,” according to the Association for Computer Machinery’s website. Li did not respond to emailed requests for comment nor a voicemail left on his office phone.",

    "title": "Inside DOGE’s AI Push at the Department of Veterans Affairs",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been clear about its plans to fire tens of thousands of employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs. New WIRED reporting sheds light on the specific DOGE operatives at the VA and the ways they’re trying to infiltrate and drastically change the agency.\n\nOn March 25, tech staffers and contractors at the VA noticed an unfamiliar name trying to push changes that could impact VA.gov code. It was Sahil Lavingia, a newcomer to the agency listed in the VA’s internal directory as an adviser to the chief of staff, Christopher Syrek.\n\nLavingia's presence in the VA's GitHub instance—a publicly viewable platform that houses projects and code for VA.gov—set off immediate alarm bells. It bore all the hallmarks of DOGE’s incursion into the federal government: Lavingia, a startup CEO and engineer with no government experience, all of a sudden had power—and was in their systems.\n\nSince then, VA employees say they have had multiple concerns following interactions with Lavingia. Beyond his GitHub access, sources who spoke to WIRED indicate that Lavingia, who said on Slack that he wanted to digitize the agency, also appears to be trying to use an AI tool called OpenHands to write code for the VA’s systems. One person with knowledge says that Lavingia had been given what’s known as a “zero account,” which would allow him to be granted privileged access to VA systems.\n\nIn response to WIRED’s questions about his work at the VA, Lavingia responded by email saying, “Sorry, I'm not going to answer these, besides to say I'm unpaid. And a fan of your work!”\n\nLavingia is not the only DOGE representative at the VA. According to sources within the agency, the DOGE delegation also includes Cary Volpert and Christopher Roussos. Other known DOGE members at the VA include Justin Fulcher, who ran a telehealth startup that went bankrupt in the late 2010s, and Payton Rehling and Jon Koval, both of whom worked for Valor Equity Partners and appeared at the Social Security Administration along with the fund’s founder and Musk ally, Antonio Gracias.\n\nThese DOGE operatives appear to have no work experience that’s remotely close to the VA in terms of its scale or complexity. The VA administers all the government benefits afforded to veterans and their families for roughly 10 million people, including education, loans, disability payments, and health care. Lavingia is the CEO of Gumroad, a platform that helps creatives sell their work and takes a cut of each sale. More recently, according to his blog, Lavingia launched Flexile, a tool to manage and pay contractors. According to his LinkedIn profile, Lavingia was the second employee at Pinterest, which he left in 2011 to found Gumroad. Lavingia is also an angel investor in other startups via SHL Capital, which backed Clubhouse and Lambda School, among others.\n\nVolpert, who is listed as a senior adviser to the chief of staff, is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania. On a third-party job site Volpert is listed as the founder of a startup called Lindy Live, which once offered social engagement for senior citizens. According to documents viewed by WIRED, Volpert has been reviewing VA contracts with what appears to be the intent of canceling those agreements. Roussos is the former CEO of 24 Hour Fitness and most recently was CEO of AllerVie Health, an allergy and immunology startup, according to his LinkedIn profile. Last February, he became chair of the company’s board of directors. He is also listed as an adviser to the chief of staff at the VA. Volpert, Roussos, and Lavingia, according to a source at the VA, were introduced by agency leadership in meetings as DOGE representatives.",

    "title": "Trump’s Tariffs Are Threatening the US Semiconductor Revival",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "Silicon Valley let out a sigh of relief on Wednesday when it learned that President Donald Trump’s tariff bonanza included an exemption for semiconductors, which, at least for now, won’t be subject to higher import duties. But just three days later, some US tech companies may be finding that the loophole actually creates more problems than it solves. After the tariffs were announced, the White House published a list of the products that it says are unaffected, and it doesn’t include many kinds of chip-related goods.\n\nThat means only a small number of American manufacturers will be able to continue sourcing chips without needing to factor in higher import costs. The vast majority of semiconductors that come into the US currently are already packaged into products that are not exempt, such as the graphics processing units (GPUs) and servers for training artificial intelligence models. And manufacturing equipment that domestic companies use to produce chips in the US wasn’t spared, either.\n\n“If you are a major chip producer who is making a sizable investment in the US, a hundred billion dollars will buy you a lot less in the next few years than the last few years,” says Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStacy Rasgon, a senior analyst covering semiconductors at Bernstein Research, says the narrow exception for chips will do little to blunt wider negative impacts on the industry. Given that most semiconductors arrive at US borders packaged into servers, smartphones, and other products, the tariffs amount to “something in the ballpark of a 40 percent blended tariff on that stuff,” Rasgon says, referring to the overall import duty rate applied.\n\nRasgon notes that the semiconductor industry is deeply dependent on other imports and on the overall health of the US economy, because the components it makes are in so many kinds of consumer products, from cars to refrigerators. “They are macro-exposed,” he says.\n\nTo determine what goods the tariffs apply to, the Trump administration relied on a complex existing system called the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), which organizes millions of different products sold in the US market into numerical categories that correspond to different import duty rates. The White House document lists only a narrow group of HTS codes in the semiconductor field that it says are exempted from the new tariffs.\n\nGPUs, for example, are typically coded as either 8473.30 or 8542.31 in the HTS system, says Nancy Wei, a supply chain analyst at the consulting firm Eurasia Group. But Trump’s waiver only applies to more advanced GPUs in the latter 8542.31 category. It also doesn’t cover other codes for related types of computing hardware. Nvidia’s DGX systems, a pre-configured server with built-in GPUs designed for AI computing tasks, is coded as 8471.50, according to the company’s website, which means it’s likely not exempt from the tariffs.\n\nThe line between these distinctions can sometimes be blurry. In 2020, for example, an importer of two Nvidia GPU models asked US authorities to clarify what category it considered them falling under. After looking into the matter, US Customs and Border Protection determined that the two GPUs belong to the 8473.30 category, which also isn’t exempt from the tariffs.",

    "title": "Scientists Claim to Have Brought Back the Dire Wolf",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "“Not only can we identify ancient genes and predict what they do, we can engineer them into cell lines, and we can successfully and healthily create them, and bring them back, which is awesome,” Lamm says once we get inside after viewing the wolves. The company, which recently unveiled a “woolly mouse,” has raised $435 million and says it is now worth $10.2 billion.\n\nColossal has made three dire wolves so far and plans to make a total of seven or eight, according to Lamm. The wolves that WIRED glimpsed, Romulus and Remus, were born in October. (They’re named after the twin brothers from Roman mythology who were nursed as infants by a she-wolf). A third dire wolf, Khaleesi—a nod to Game of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen—was born in January.\n\nColossal’s chief science officer, Beth Shapiro, was on a work trip to the UK when the first dire wolf litter was born. She woke up to the news that the two males had arrived. “I saw the text messages and I was like, ‘I can’t believe I wasn’t awake for this,’” she says. For the birth of Khaleesi, she was there in person. Although the company refers to Romulus and Remus as coming from the same litter, that’s not quite accurate. The two wolves are genetically identical but were carried and birthed by different mothers, Shapiro confirmed over email.\n\n“One of the arguments in favor of working on this is that it brings people to a place of awe,” she says. “The idea that you can see a species we drove to extinction that we now have brought back from extinction can give people a reframing of how we think about the biodiversity crisis.”\n\nBefore she joined Colossal as a staff member, Shapiro was a scientific adviser to the company. It was during a company meeting in Dallas while she was an adviser that the idea of bringing back the dire wolf first came up. In 2021 Shapiro had coauthored a paper that attempted to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the wolves by sequencing genomes from five different fossils. At the time, Shapiro was a professor at UC Santa Cruz—a post she still holds alongside her role at Colossal.\n\nFor this de-extinction project, Shapiro and her colleagues returned to two dire wolf fossils sequenced in that original paper: A 13,000-year-old tooth from Sheridan Pit, Ohio, and a 72,000-year-old inner ear bone from American Falls, Idaho. The scientists extracted and sequenced the ancient DNA from the two fossils, assembling it into a genome that Shapiro says contains 500 times more data than the previous analysis.\n\nThis new analysis might also change our understanding of the dire wolf’s evolutionary history. Scientists previously thought that dire wolves diverged from their shared ancestor with gray wolves around 5.7 million years ago, making the extinct wolves genetically closer to jackals than gray wolves. But the Colossal analysis, Shapiro says, found that dire wolves were the product of interbreeding between two different wolf lineages that took place between 2.5 and 3.5 million years ago. Shapiro says that she and the authors of the original paper are planning to release a new paper that incorporates the new data from the Colossal analysis.",

    "title": "Nintendo Is ‘Actively Assessing’ What a Trade War Means for the Switch 2",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "In the run-up to the Switch 2 launch, part of Nintendo’s focus has been on ensuring it can meet the demands of an audience hungry for a new console. And that new system comes with a hefty price—$450—which could go up even more due to President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs announced last week.\n\nBut in an interview a day after Trump’s announcement, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser told WIRED the tariffs “weren’t factored into the pricing” of the console.\n\nThe company is “actively assessing” the situation and its impact, he adds. “It creates a challenge,” Bowser says. “It’s something we're going to have to address.”\n\nTrump’s tariffs sent the stock market into free fall; prices on many products are about to go up, and companies in the tech sector will be turned on their heads. On Friday, Nintendo made the unprecedented move of delaying preorders in the US for the hotly anticipated console “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.”\n\nPart of the company’s business strategy, to this point, had been “to diversify the places where we're manufacturing our hardware and our accessories,” Bowser says. The company has already shifted much of its production to Vietnam and Cambodia and away from China.\n\nAccording to Bowser, that diversification allowed Nintendo to move production around as needed during the Covid-19 pandemic. “That also applied to the early stages of tariffs,” he says. “The situation [on April 2] changed that.” Among Trump’s new tariffs: 46 percent on Vietnam, 49 percent on Cambodia, and 54 percent on China.\n\nAn additional price hike on the console would be problematic for Nintendo. The current top Switch model, the OLED, is $350, while a standard edition comes in at $300. The price was oddly missing from the console’s big announcement on Wednesday, a fact that hasn’t been lost on would-be customers already clamoring for Nintendo to “drop the price.” At the New York event, journalists were discouraged from asking hardware developers about the console’s cost.\n\nGames have not been spared from high price tags either; Mario Kart World will cost $80. Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a tech demo masquerading as a game that explains the ins and outs of the Switch 2, will be an experience people have to pay for. (Notably, this got a huge laugh from the crowd present.)\n\nTwo former Nintendo public relations managers, Krysta Yang and Kit Ellis, have broken down the criticism around the pricing on their YouTube channel, as well as criticized how news about the price was presented to fans.\n\n“Obviously it was intentionally omitted from the Direct for a reason but handled poorly in terms of the information being in all these different places,” Yang said, lambasting the decision to leave consumers to get answers themselves. “It’s a little bit degrading almost to the intelligence of the consumer.”",

    "content": "Apple first started designing its in-house chips back in 2020, which are dispersed throughout different Macs, MacBooks, and iPads. As of now, the company has released a total of 14 M-series chips. As new versions come out, machines with older chips are discontinued at Apple and tougher to find at third-party retailers.\n\nThe M4 series is the current generation of silicon from Apple. There's a choice between an M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. Each chip is built on a second-generation 3-nanometer process, which fits more transistors into a smaller space to enhance speed and efficiency. Both the M4 Pro and M4 Max come with mesh shading and ray tracing too, which Apple says is twice as fast as on the M3 chip.\n\nThe M4 (with a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU) is the entry-level option and best for basic tasks. The M4 Pro (with a 14-core CPU and an up to 20-core GPU) is the better option for those who need a bit more power for tasks like heavy-duty video or photo editing. The M4 Max (with a 16-core CPU and up to a 40-core GPU) is the most powerful chip you can get in a MacBook but the second-most-powerful chip available in a Mac desktop.\n\nThe latest M3 Ultra holds that title. Even though the M3 series was introduced in 2023, Apple announced this one in 2025. It comes with an up to 32-core CPU (with 24 performance cores) and a GPU with up to 80 cores. You'll also get 96 GB of unified memory, with the option to upgrade up to 512 GB, and storage can be increased to 16 TB. Apple claims it's up to 2.5 times faster than the M1 Ultra. It's only available in the 2025 Mac Studio.\n\nIt's worth noting that even if the M4 processor sounds newer and better than, say, an M3 Pro, the latter is actually the faster processor. You need to compare the tiers to one another, meaning an M4 is better than an M3, and the M4 Pro is better than the M3 Pro. Still, it's a good idea to hunt for older models with these Pro, Max, or Ultra chips if you're looking for the best bargain and a lot of power.\n\nYou can find a full breakdown of each chip in our guide to the Best MacBooks.",

    "content": "A prominent computer scientist who has spent 20 years publishing academic papers on cryptography, privacy, and cybersecurity has gone incommunicado, had his professor profile, email account, and phone number removed by his employer, Indiana University, and had his homes raided by the FBI. No one knows why.\n\nXiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.\n\nArs Technica This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast.\n\nHe has also coauthored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles here, here, and here.\n\n“None of This Is in Any Way Normal”\n\nIn recent weeks, Wang's email account, phone number, and profile page at the Luddy School were quietly erased by his employer. Over the same time, Indiana University also removed a profile for his wife, Nianli Ma, who was listed as a lead systems analyst and programmer at the university's Library Technologies division.\n\nAs reported by The Bloomingtonian and later the The Herald-Times in Bloomington, a small fleet of unmarked cars driven by government agents descended on the Bloomington home of Wang and Ma on Friday. They spent most of the day going in and out of the house and occasionally transferred boxes from their vehicles. TV station WTHR, meanwhile, reported that a second home owned by Wang and Ma, located in Carmel, Indiana, was also searched. The station said that both a resident and an attorney for the resident were on scene during at least part of the search.\n\nAttempts to locate Wang and Ma have so far been unsuccessful. An Indiana University spokesman didn't answer emailed questions asking if the couple was still employed by the university and why their profile pages, email addresses, and phone numbers had been removed. The spokesman provided the contact information for a spokeswoman at the FBI's field office in Indianapolis. In an email, the spokeswoman wrote: “The FBI conducted court authorized law enforcement activity at homes in Bloomington and Carmel Friday. We have no further comment at this time.”\n\nSearches of federal court dockets turned up no documents related to Wang, Ma, or any searches of their residences. The FBI spokeswoman didn't answer questions seeking which US district court issued the warrant and when, and whether either Wang or Ma is being detained by authorities. Justice Department representatives didn't return an email seeking the same information. An email sent to a personal email address belonging to Wang went unanswered at the time this post went live. Their resident status (e.g., US citizens or green card holders) is currently unknown.\n\nFellow researchers took to social media over the weekend to register their concern over the series of events.\n\n“None of this is in any way normal,” Matthew Green, a professor specializing in cryptography at Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Mastodon. He continued: “Has anyone been in contact? I hear he’s been missing for two weeks and his students can’t reach him. How does this not get noticed for two weeks???”",

    "title": "DOGE Is Planning a Hackathon at the IRS. It Wants Easier Access to Taxpayer Data",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has plans to stage a “hackathon” next week in Washington, DC. The goal is to create a single “mega API”—a bridge that lets software systems talk to one another—for accessing IRS data, sources tell WIRED. The agency is expected to partner with a third-party vendor to manage certain aspects of the data project. Palantir, a software company cofounded by billionaire and Musk associate Peter Thiel, has been brought up consistently by DOGE representatives as a possible candidate, sources tell WIRED.\n\nTwo top DOGE operatives at the IRS, Sam Corcos and Gavin Kliger, are helping to orchestrate the hackathon, sources tell WIRED. Corcos is a health-tech CEO with ties to Musk’s SpaceX. Kliger attended UC Berkeley until 2020 and worked at the AI company Databricks before joining DOGE as a special adviser to the director at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Corcos is also a special adviser to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nSince joining Musk’s DOGE, Corcos has told IRS workers that he wants to pause all engineering work and cancel current attempts to modernize the agency’s systems, according to sources with direct knowledge who spoke with WIRED. He has also spoken about some aspects of these cuts publicly: \"We've so far stopped work and cut about $1.5 billion from the modernization budget. Mostly projects that were going to continue to put us down the death spiral of complexity in our code base,\" Corcos told Laura Ingraham on Fox News in March.\n\nCorcos has discussed plans for DOGE to build “one new API to rule them all,” making IRS data more easily accessible for cloud platforms, sources say. APIs, or application programming interfaces, enable different applications to exchange data, and could be used to move IRS data into the cloud. The cloud platform could become the “read center of all IRS systems,” a source with direct knowledge tells WIRED, meaning anyone with access could view and possibly manipulate all IRS data in one place.\n\nOver the past few weeks, DOGE has requested the names of the IRS’s best engineers from agency staffers. Next week, DOGE and IRS leadership are expected to host dozens of engineers in DC so they can begin “ripping up the old systems” and building the API, an IRS engineering source tells WIRED. The goal is to have this task completed within 30 days. Sources say there have been multiple discussions about involving third-party cloud and software providers like Palantir in the implementation.\n\nCorcos and DOGE indicated to IRS employees that they intended to first apply the API to the agency’s mainframes and then move on to every other internal system. Initiating a plan like this would likely touch all data within the IRS, including taxpayer names, addresses, social security numbers, as well as tax return and employment data. Currently, the IRS runs on dozens of disparate systems housed in on-premises data centers and in the cloud that are purposefully compartmentalized. Accessing these systems requires special permissions and workers are typically only granted access on a need-to-know basis.",

    "title": "The Trump Tariffs Are How Everything Works Now",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "There are situations in which tariffs are a useful tool to address a trade deficit, or to protect key sectors of a country’s economy. Then there are situations where you accuse a bunch of penguins on an uninhabited island of currency manipulation. Guess which one we’re living in?\n\nThis is the takeaway of the manifold tariffs announced by President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon. In addition to the penguin-occupied Heard and McDonald Islands, the tariffs target the British Indian Ocean Territory, whose sole occupants live on a joint US-UK military base on Diego Garcia island. Yes, the United States is levying reciprocal tariffs against its own troops.\n\nAnd then there are the tariffs against countries that have actual goods and services on which US consumers depend. China: 54 percent. Vietnam: 46 percent. Cambodia: 49 percent. South Korea: 25 percent. No corner of the US consumer economy will go untouched. Prices will rise. The stock market is spiraling. A recession looms. The tech industry will be turned upside down. Mark Cuban, noted billionaire, is encouraging people to stockpile consumables before it’s too late.\n\nIt’s reckless, it’s absurd, and it’s also everything Donald Trump said plainly he would do on the campaign trail. True, he didn’t telegraph how misguided the methodology would be—you can read about it more here, but suffice to say it’s thoroughly detached from the realities of international trade—but he loudly, repeatedly promised to tariff his way to glory.\n\nThe stated goal is to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, which is a bit like resurrecting the dodo. The US still manufactures plenty of goods; it’s second only to China in annual output, according to the World Bank. But many of the industry’s jobs have been replaced by automation, a bottle you can’t re-cork. And higher domestic labor costs mean US-made products will inherently be more expensive, a trade-off American consumers have consistently rejected. All of this was already true in Trump’s first term. It’s even more so now.\n\nAnd let’s say a plurality of companies did decide to reshore or set up factories in the United States. The timeline for those decisions and implementation is measured in years, if not decades, and follow-through can be spotty. (Just ask Foxconn.) So what happens in the meantime?\n\nThe rationale has all the weight of a soap bubble. There isn’t a world where the US suddenly manufactures all the items the country has decided to target. There’s a 47 percent tariff on Madagascar now. Do you know why the US has a trade deficit with Madagascar? They produce vanilla; we don’t. Unless we’re suddenly setting up vanilla assembly lines in Ohio, that’s not changing.\n\nBut maybe Trump’s so-called Liberation Day is all just a master negotiating ploy. “Everybody sit back, take a deep breath. Don’t immediately retaliate. Let’s see where this goes,” said Treasury secretary Scott Bessent on CNN Wednesday. “Because if you retaliate, that’s how we get escalation.”",

    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "The Trump administration, working in coordination with Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has gutted a small federal agency that provides funding to libraries and museums nationwide. In communities across the US, the cuts threaten student field trips, classes for seniors, and access to popular digital services, such as the ebook app Libby.\n\nOn Monday, managers at the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) informed 77 employees—virtually the agency’s entire staff—that they were immediately being put on paid administrative leave, according to one of the workers, who sought anonymity out of fear of retaliation from Trump officials. Several other sources confirmed the move, which came after President Donald Trump appointed Keith Sonderling, the deputy secretary of labor, as the acting director of IMLS less than two weeks ago.\n\nA representative for the American Federation of Government Employee Local 3403, a union that represents about 40 IMLS staffers, said Sonderling and a group of DOGE staffers met with IMLS leadership late last month. Afterwards, Sonderling sent an email to staff “emphasizing the importance of libraries and museums in cultivating the next generation’s perception of American exceptionalism and patriotism,” the union representative said in a statement to WIRED.\n\nIMLS employees who showed up to work at the agency on Monday were asked to turn in their computers and lost access to their government email addresses before being ordered to head home for the day, the employee says. It’s unclear when, or if, staffers will ever return to work. “It’s heartbreaking on many levels,” the employee adds.\n\nThe White House and the Institute of Museum and Library Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.\n\nThe annual budget of IMLS amounts to less than $1 per person in the US. Overall, the agency awarded over $269.5 million to library and museum systems last year, according to its grants database. Much of that money is paid out as reimbursements over time, the current IMLS employee says, but now there is no one around to cut checks for funds that have already been allocated.\n\n“The status of previously awarded grants is unclear. Without staff to administer the programs, it is likely that most grants will be terminated,” the American Federation of Government Employee Local 3403 union said in a statement.\n\nAbout 65 percent of the funding had been allocated to different states, with each one scheduled to receive a minimum of roughly $1.2 million. Recipients can use the money for statewide initiatives or pass it on to local museum and library institutions for expenses such as staff training and back-office software. California and Texas have received the highest allocated funding, at about $12.5 million and $15.7 million, respectively, according to IMLS data. Individual libraries and museums also receive grants directly from IMLS for specific projects.\n\nAn art museum in Idaho expected to put $10,350 toward supporting student field trips, according to the IMLS grant database. A North Carolina museum was allotted $23,500 for weaving and fiber art workshops for seniors. And an indigenous community in California expected to put $10,000 toward purchasing books and electronic resources.",

    "content": "The year that ChatGPT went viral, only two US companies—OpenAI and Google—could boast truly cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Three years on, AI is no longer a two-horse race, nor is it purely an American one. A new report published today by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) highlights just how crowded the field has become.\n\nThe institute’s 2025 AI index, which collates data and trends on the state of the AI industry, paints a picture of an increasingly competitive, global, and unrestrained race toward artificial general intelligence—AI that surpasses human abilities.\n\nOpenAI and Google are still neck and neck in the race to build bleeding-edge AI, the report shows. But several other companies are closing in. In the US, the fiercest competition comes from Meta’s open-weight Llama models; Anthropic, a company founded by former OpenAI employees; and Elon Musk’s xAI.\n\nMost strikingly, according to a widely used benchmark called LMSYS, the latest model from China’s DeepSeek, R1, ranks closest to the top-performing models built by the two leading American AI companies.\n\n“It creates an exciting space. It’s good that these models are not all developed by five guys in Silicon Valley,” says Vanessa Parli, director of research at HAI.\n\n“Chinese models are catching up as far as performance to the US models,” Parli adds, “but across the globe, there are new players emerging in the space.”\n\nCourtesy of Stanford HAI\n\nThe arrival of DeepSeek-R1 in January sent shock waves through the US tech industry and stock market. The company claimed to have built its model using a fraction of the compute used by US rivals. DeepSeek’s debut was also a surprise because the US government has repeatedly sought to limit China’s access to the computer chips needed to build the most advanced AI.",

    "title": "States Are Banning Forever Chemicals. Industry Is Fighting Back",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "In 2021, James Kenney and his husband were at a big box store buying a piece of furniture when the sales associate asked if they’d like to add fabric protectant. Kenney, the cabinet secretary of New Mexico’s Environment Department, asked to see the product data sheet. Both he and his husband, a chemical engineer, were shocked to see forever chemicals listed as ingredients in the protectant.\n\n“I think about your normal, everyday New Mexican who is trying to get by, make their furniture last a little longer, and they think, ‘Oh, it’s safe, great!’ It’s not safe,” he says. “It just so happens that they tried to sell it to the environment secretary.”\n\nLast week, the New Mexico legislature passed a pair of bills that Kenney hopes will help protect consumers in his state. If signed by the governor, the legislation would eventually ban consumer products that have added PFAS—per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, known colloquially as “forever chemicals” because of their persistence in the environment—from being sold in New Mexico.\n\nAs health and environmental concerns about forever chemicals mount nationally, New Mexico joins a small but growing number of states that are moving to limit—and, in some cases, ban—PFAS in consumer products. New Mexico is now the third state to pass a PFAS ban through the legislature. Ten other states have bans or limits on added PFAS in certain consumer products, including cookware, carpet, apparel, and cosmetics. This year, at least 29 states—a record number—have PFAS-related bills before state legislatures, according to an analysis of bills by Safer States, a network of state-based advocacy organizations working on issues around potentially unsafe chemicals.\n\nThe chemical and consumer products industries have taken notice of this new wave of regulations and are mounting a counterattack, lobbying state legislatures to advocate for the safety of their products—and, in one case, suing to prevent the laws from taking effect. Some of the key exemptions made in New Mexico highlight some of the big fights that industries are hoping they’ll win in statehouses across the country: fights they are already taking to a newly industry-friendly US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nPFAS is not just one chemical but a class of thousands. The first PFAS were developed in the 1930s; thanks to their nonstick properties and unique durability, their popularity grew in industrial and consumer uses in the postwar era. The chemicals were soon omnipresent in American lives, coating cookware, preventing furniture and carpets from staining, and acting as a surfactant in firefighting foam.\n\nIn 1999, a man in West Virginia filed a lawsuit against US chemical giant DuPont alleging that pollution from its factory was killing his cattle. The lawsuit revealed that DuPont had concealed evidence of PFAS’s negative health effects on workers from the government for decades. In the years since, the chemical industry has paid out billions in settlement fees around PFAS lawsuits: in 2024, the American multinational 3M agreed to pay between $10 billion and $12.5 billion to US public water systems that had detected PFAS in their water supplies to pay for remediation and future testing, though the company did not admit liability. (DuPont and its separate chemical company Chemours continue to deny any wrongdoing in lawsuits involving them, including the original West Virginia suit.)",

Dead Talents Society sees warring \"ghostresses\" Catherine (Sandrine Pinna) and her former protégé Jessica (Eleven Yao) battling for glamour and prestige in the great beyond by innovating new ways of scaring mortals, while a newcomer known only as Rookie (Gingle Wang) struggles to make her mark with any scares at all—and risks fading away entirely if she can't earn her undead keep. A sharply satirical horror comedy poking fun at everything from reality TV to hustle culture, this Taiwanese outing from writer-director John Hsu beats Beetlejuice at its own game.\n\nLeave the World Behind\n\nA weekend getaway at a luxury vacation rental property for Amanda and Clay and their kids, Archie and Rose, takes a sinister turn in the wake of an inexplicable blackout. When the house's owner, George, and his daughter Ruth return early, suspicions mount—but a growing herd of deer lurking outside the house, failing vehicles, and scattered reports of attacks across the US force the two families to rely on each other in the face of what may be the end of the world. Adapted from the novel of same name by Rumaan Alam, and with a star-studded cast including Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Myha'la, and Kevin Bacon, this relishes in keeping the audiences as uncertain as its characters, explaining little, and leaving questions you'll be mulling for days.\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nMiles Morales’ (Shameik Moore) growth as Spider-Man continues in this phenomenal sequel to the Academy Award–winning Into the Spider-Verse—but this time, the web-slinger's neighborhood is a lot bigger and a lot less friendly. Introduced to a multiversal “Spider Society” led by the imposing Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac), Miles finds he's the only Spider-Man not invited—and that an unavoidable tragedy lies in his future. Even more visually ambitious than its predecessor, with each alternate reality—and the heroes that call them home, including Gwen Stacey Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Man India (Karan Soni), and Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya)—brought to life with distinctive design and animation styles, Across the Spider-Verse is an almost unspeakably ambitious outing. It's also one that balances sheer spectacle with darker, more emotional conflicts for Miles, offering neither him nor viewers any easy answers. A film so brilliant that the wait for the upcoming third installment, Beyond the Spider-Verse, becomes increasingly painful with every passing day.\n\nTroll\n\nThis gleefully entertaining giant monster movie abandons tearing up Tokyo or New York in favor of director Roar Uthaug’s (2018's Tomb Raider) native Norway, with a titanic troll stomping its way toward Oslo after being roused by a drilling operation. Although the plot and characters will be familiar to any fan of kaiju cinema, the striking Nordic visuals and the titular menace’s ability to blend in with the landscape, allows for some impressively original twists along the way. Although Troll could have easily descended into near-parody, Uthaug steers clear of smug self-awareness and instead delivers, and with a sequel arriving later in 2025, now is the perfect time to revisit one of the freshest takes on the genre in years.\n\nPlankton: The Movie\n\nWould-be evil overlord Plankton finally steals the spotlight in his self-titled SpongeBob spinoff movie—only to immediately lose it to his robot wife Karen when she enacts her own plan to take over the world. Teaming with archnemesis SpongeBob, the diminutive despot soon faces a challenge bigger than stealing the Krabby Patty recipe: learning to listen to his wife. While the SpongeBob movies have been hit or miss, this one is a charming and genuinely funny outing, building on and paying off 25 years (!) worth of SpongeBob in-jokes and online memes. Plankton balances the fine line between being accessible family viewing and fourth-wall-breaking self-referentialism for older fans. Its use of multiple animation styles and live-action sequences makes it visually impressive to boot.\n\nOkja\n\nBefore winning Oscars and cementing his name in the Hollywood firmament with Parasite, Bong Joon-ho had something of a sideline in creature features. While 2006’s The Host remains worth hunting down, this 2017 saga of genetic engineering and animal exploitation may be the director’s pinnacle of the genre. After helping raise an enhanced “super pig” in rural South Korea, young Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun) is distraught when the American company behind its creation, Mirando, comes to take it back. Falling in with a group of Animal Liberation Front activists, Mija travels to Mirando’s headquarters in New York in a desperate effort to rescue her unlikely animal friend. Darkly satirical in places, Okja manages to explore themes of animal exploitation and environmental conservation without feeling preachy.\n\nI Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore\n\nWhen nursing assistant Ruth Kimke (Melanie Lynskey) returns home to discover she's been burgled, the loss of her possessions and the sense of violation isn't her breaking point—that comes later, when faced with disinterested cops and fearful neighbors who don't want to get involved. Attempting to seek justice herself, aided only by outsider and nunchaku aficionado Tony (a brilliantly against-type Elijah Wood), Ruth's decision descends into a disastrous experiment with vigilante justice. A wry but grim look at modern life, Ruth's ultimate goal is best summed up by her answer to “what do you want?” being a blunt “for people to not be assholes.” A treatise on apathy, Macon Blair's 2017 directorial debut was one of Netflix's earlier forays into producing exclusive content, but it remains one of the smartest dark comedies on the platform today.\n\nThe Two Popes\n\nAt first glance, The Two Popes is not a gripping proposition: a film where two very old men in dresses talk a lot, walk around a little bit, and then talk some more. But two top-notch performances from Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins and a stellar script from Anthony McCarten turn this prosaic premise into a film worth watching. Set in the wake of the Vatican leaks scandal and loosely inspired by true events, it follows Cardinal Bergoglio as he tries to convince Pope Benedict XVI to accept his resignation. The two men couldn't be more different—Benedict is an archconservative desperate to cling to tradition while Bergoglio is seen as a dangerous liberalizer who might erode the Church's authority. While the two men battle out their differences, the future of Catholicism hangs in the balance. If you enjoyed the recent Conclave, this is worth your time too.\n\nY Tu Mamá También\n\nIt's uncommon to find much in the way of classic films on Netflix—the algorithm must ever be fed by the churn of the new—so the availability of Alfonso Cuarón's brilliant 2001 coming-of-age movie is a real delight. Set in Mexico in 1999, Y Tu Mamá También (“And your mother, too”) follows rich kid Tenoch (Diego Luna) and his working-class friend Julio (Gael García Bernal) on a road trip with Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the wife of Tenoch’s cousin. It's a journey that sees the young men—still boys, really—competing for attention from the beautiful older woman, trapping themselves in lies and trying to get by on unearned confidence, all while claiming to be heading to a picture-perfect beach that they made up. As for why the much more mature and experienced Luisa would go along with them in the first place? Pack tissues. While the film courted controversy for its frank depiction of sex and drugs (it's not one for family film night), it remains a masterpiece; a raucous and all-too-real examination of young friendships and fragile masculinity.\n\nParasite\n\nDirector Bong Joon-ho's searing 2019 thriller is the first non-English film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it's abundantly clear why. Its bleak exploration of economic disparity and condemnation of capitalistic excess is focused on its South Korea setting, but it resonates with global audiences. Parasite follows the struggling Kim family as they each infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Parks, posing as household servants to live a life of proximate luxury before their deception spirals wildly out of control. Somehow, it's also darkly comedic, mocking the obliviousness of the rich classes, both to their own privileges and to the desperation of the poor. Throughout, it's exquisitely shot and expertly paced, with Bong deftly increasing the tension with every scene until everything approaches a seemingly inevitable conclusion—and then still manages to twist and subvert audience expectations. A spectacular piece of filmmaking that deserves the hype, this examination of class and inequality feels more relevant than ever.\n\nMononoke the Movie: Phantom in the Rain\n\nIn Edo Japan, two young women, Asa and Kame, aim to better their lives by entering the Inner Chambers of the Imperial Palace, where dozens if not hundreds of women exchange comfort for trying to bear a male heir. Yet as they enter, they find themselves trapped in something more like a cult, with a dark and unnatural presence lurking in the heart of the castle. Their only hope is a wandering man known only as the Medicine Seller, possessing the skills and knowledge to exorcise the terrifying force—but men aren’t allowed in. A follow-up to the 2007 TV anime Mononoke (also available on Netflix), this stand-alone outing is not only a masterclass in tension and supernatural horror, but thanks to its stunning visual approach evoking watercolors on parchment, it’s one of the most sumptuous and visually striking pieces of animation you’ll ever see. The first of three planned Mononoke movies, Phantom in the Rain gets this trilogy off to a sensational start.\n\nCarry-On\n\nIs a movie set at Christmas in itself a Christmas movie? That debate has surged around Die Hard for decades. Now Carry-On asks the same question. A zippy thriller from House of Wax and Black Adam director Jaume Collet-Serra, this sees TSA agent Ethan Kopek (Taron Egerton) caught in the Christmas Eve shift from hell when he’s blackmailed by a mercenary known only as the Traveler (Jason Bateman) into allowing a deadly package through security. Cue a lethal game of cat-and-mouse as Ethan tries to stop the Traveler—all with the life of Ethan’s girlfriend Nora (Sofia Carson) in the balance. It’s pulpy and schlocky in places, but this throwback action outing can’t help but entertain.\n\nJoy\n\nIn vitro fertilization may seem like a relatively mundane medical procedure nowadays, one that's brought hope and family to countless people struggling to conceive, but when the procedure was developed by a trio of British scientists and medics in the 1960s and '70s, it was hugely controversial. That makes for powerful material for this dramatization, charting the work of nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie), scientist Robert Edwards (James Norton), and surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Bill Nighy), even as they're demonized by the public, the UK government, and even—perhaps especially—the church. McKenzie in particular is brilliant as Purdy, torn by her own conflict of faith at being involved in the life-changing work, which also involved providing safe abortion care to women who needed it, and struggling to deal with the ostracizing she faces from her family and community as a result. A powerful and provocative drama, even now.\n\nEmilia Pérez\n\nSaying you’ve never seen anything like Emilia Pérez is a wild understatement. Truly, how could anything described as a “trans cartel musical” be anything but arresting to watch? At the onset, Rita (Zoe Saldaña) is an exhausted lawyer in Mexico City doing work her boss takes credit for. Everything changes when she’s contacted by a cartel boss who needs her help to receive gender-affirming care. Rita obliges, launching a partnership between the two that eventually includes launching an organization to help families who have lost members to cartel violence and a (perhaps misguided) effort to reunite the mob boss, the Emilia of the film’s title (played by Spanish actress Karla Sofía Gascón), with the wife and children who believe she’s dead. Full of changes in plot and tone that are all but impossible to see coming, director Jacques Audiard’s latest remains engaging until the final moment.\n\nThe Karate Kid\n\nIf you're hooked on the melee melodrama of Cobra Kai, you owe it to yourself to see where it all began. When Daniel LaRusso's mother moves the family from New Jersey to California, the teenager has to face the greatest threats of 1980s teen cinema: a new school, a daunting crush, and meathead bullies. Outclassed in a brawl with rival Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), Daniel (Ralph Macchio) convinces neighbor Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) to teach him karate. Can Mr. Miyagi's teaching methods—doing chores and learning to “wax on, wax off”—really help Daniel even the odds? Spoiler: yes. Cheesy and incredibly '80s, The Karate Kid remains a fun watch, four decades on.\n\nWoman of the Hour\n\nA serial killer is cast as a bachelor on a dating game show, allowing him to size up his next potential victim right in front of the audience watching at home. That'd be a twisted setup for a slasher flick—but what's horrifying about Woman of the Hour is that it's based on the real-life case of Rodney Alcala, who was a contestant on The Dating Game in 1978 while in the midst of a string of murders. This dramatization isn't centered on the killer, though. In her directorial debut, Anna Kendrick focuses instead on Sheryl (played by Kendrick, based on the real life Cheryl Bradshaw), the one unfortunate enough to be matched with Alcala (Daniel Zovatto), and the women who reported or suspected the killer, only to be routinely ignored by authorities. A taut thriller that makes clear the real horror lies in how easily Acala eluded attention for so long.\n\nDon't Move\n\nSingle-handedly reopening the \"man or bear\" debate, Don't Move follows a grieving young mother named Iris (Kelsey Asbille, Yellowstone) who is hunted through the wilderness after being injected with a paralytic agent by a stranger. With her body slowly shutting down, Iris has 20 minutes to escape or find help, all as her assailant, Richard (Finn Wittrock), coldly, implacably tracks her down. Directed by Adam Schindler and Brian Netto, and produced by Sam Raimi, this expertly paced game of cat-and-mouse rarely lets up, and Asbille gives an incredible performance as the increasingly immobile Iris. If you go down to the woods today … choose the bear.\n\nWill & Harper\n\nWill Ferrell likely needs no introduction, but as former head writer of Saturday Night Live, Harper Steele is more accustomed to life behind the camera. Joining the hit show in the same week back in 1995, the pair struck up a decades-long friendship—so when Harper wrote to tell Ferrell she was transitioning to live as a woman, it was a big change for them both. It also formed the basis for this beautiful, heartwarming, and often laugh-out-loud funny road trip documentary following the duo as they cross the US in an old Jeep Grand Wagoneer, reconnecting and learning what their friendship looks like now. It's awkward viewing at times—some of Ferrell's questions blur the line between bawdy and simply rude—but it's a raw and authentic journey for them both. Beyond the personal touches, Will & Harper is a timely view of what America looks like for a trans person right now, making it possibly one of the most important documentaries Netflix has produced.\n\nHis Three Daughters\n\nAs their father approaches the end of his life, sisters Rachel (Natasha Lyonne), Katie (Carrie Coon), and Christina (Elizabeth Olsen) are forced to reconnect while waiting for the inevitable. Bleak stuff, but also grounds for masterful performances from the lead trio, with Rachel having taken on the bulk of care for months, Katie casting imperious demands despite avoiding the situation, and new-agey Christina trying to keep the peace—despite being at a breaking point herself. This is almost a locked-room piece, the apartment trapping the women, forcing them to come to terms with not only their father's death but their own relationships with each other, all while Vincent (Jay O. Sanders) haunts them even before his passing. Death may loom over director Azazel Jacobs’ drama, but His Three Daughters ultimately proves oddly life-affirming.\n\nGrave of the Fireflies\n\nWhen Seita and his young sister Setsuko are orphaned in the wake of the fire-bombing of Kobe during the final days of World War II, the siblings are forced into terrible circumstances to survive. Stuck between abusive extended family and the sheer desperation of scavenging around the ruins of their destroyed hometown, it's a bleak existence—and also the basis for one of Studio Ghibli's finest works. Directed by Isao Takahata and based on a short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave of the Fireflies is unapologetically harrowing in its exploration of how war and nationalism chew up the most vulnerable, yet peppered with moments of unwavering love as Seita attempts to protect Setsuko's innocence. This searing wartime drama is sobering but essential viewing, a film that's more than earned its ranking in the upper echelons of the Best Studio Ghibli films.\n\nRebel Ridge\n\nWhen corrupt cops run ex-Marine Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) off the road for cycling while Black, they also seize the money he had been planning to use to post his cousin’s bail. Despite the injustice, Terry tries to do everything by the book but finds almost every aspect of the legal system against him. Out of patience, and fueled by immensely justified anger, he sets about tearing out the rot from the small town, aided only by court clerk Summer (AnnaSophia Robb). Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier could have made Rebel Ridge merely a modern day First Blood, but while there’s plenty of visceral, bone-breaking fight scenes, it’s the film’s righteously angry look at the baked-in failings of the American legal system that gives this its bite—all while cementing Pierre as an action star to watch.\n\nWicked Little Letters\n\nBased on real events, Wicked Little Letters is set in 1920, in the quaint English town of Littlehampton. When the well-to-do family of Edith Swan starts receiving abusive mail, Irish immigrant Rose Gooding—who has a reputation as a foul-mouthed troublemaker, and who recently fell out with Edith—is suspect number one. Yet as the plague of \"poison pen\" notes spreads, becoming a national scandal, only overlooked police officer Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) believes that Rose is being set up. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman is on top form as Edith, while Jessie Buckley delights with a fiery performance as Rose in this surprisingly uproarious comedy.\n\nUnder Paris\n\nThis so-serious-it's-ludicrous French creature feature sees Bérénice Bejo as marine specialist Sophia Assalas, who is hunting down a mako shark that has not only spontaneously mutated to survive in the freshwater Seine but is also about to give birth to a host of baby man-eating sharks. Worse still? Paris is about to hold a triathlon, with the swim portion set to become an all-you-can-eat buffet! Look, not everything on this list needs to be high art—sometimes, you just need to see a mutant shark straight up chomping on people while increasingly desperate humans start blowing stuff up. Press Play, turn brain off, enjoy.\n\nHit Man\n\nGary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a mild-mannered professor of philosophy—and a contract killer. Well, not quite. He just poses as one, working with the New Orleans Police Department to trap people looking to hire a hit man. It's a role he's surprisingly good at, but when Madison (Adria Arjona) looks to have her abusive husband “dealt” with, Gary begins to fall for her—and the consequences could be fatal for real. In another creator’s hands, Hit Man might have been either overly grim or simply insubstantial (it's loosely based on a true story), but director Richard Linklater leverages his signature uses of sparkling dialog and brilliantly realized characters to deliver a smart action-comedy that explores the roles people play in society as much as it serves up mistaken-identity hijinks.\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nDespite the presence of the eponymous kaiju, Godzilla Minus One is a film rooted in the humanity of its protagonists, deserter kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) and Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), a survivor of the bombings of Tokyo. Thrown together as an ersatz family as they raise an orphaned baby, their attempts to build a new life turn chaotic when the irradiated reptile descends on the city just as it's beginning to recover. Director Takashi Yamazaki's reimagining of Japan's premier kaiju netted the King of Monsters its first-ever Oscar, picking up a statue for Best Visual Effects at the 2024 Academy Awards, but this is a film that exceeds mere spectacle—it's a searing examination of life after war, and how a nation grapples with being on the losing side.\n\nSuzume\n\nSuzume Iwato (voiced by Nanoka Hara in Japanese, Nichole Sakura in English) lives with her aunt on Japan's southern island, having lost her mother in the Tōhoku earthquake of 2011. When a handsome young stranger named Souta (Hokuto Matsumura, Josh Keaton) asks her for directions to some local ruins, she follows him out of curiosity but disturbs a living keystone, accidentally unleashing an ancient power that threatens to destroy the entire country. Drawn into Souta's world, the pair chase the keystone, now in the form of a cat, across Japan in a desperate bid to reseal the destructive entity—a quest that would be easier if Souta hadn't been transformed into a child's wooden chair. The latest film from Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, Weathering with You), Suzume is a breathtakingly animated slice of magical realism with a surrealist edge—but beyond the spectacle, it's a heart-warming tale of community and humanity, each stop on the unlikely pair's journey a snapshot of people and families coming together in the wake of tragedy.\n\nMaboroshi\n\nBy any measure, Masamune lives a normal teenage existence in his rural Japanese hometown—until the local steel works erupts, mysteriously sealing the entire town in an inexplicable time bubble where no one ages. As the small community struggles to adapt, a culture that fears change emerges, initially from the presumption that residents would need to rejoin the outside world as they left it, and eventually forbids even new relationships. Yet when Masamune's strange classmate Mutsumi lures him to the ill-fated factory and introduces him to a feral young girl who should not exist, the bizarre reality they all inhabit begins to collapse. A fantasy twist on notions of youthful rebellion, the prison of familiarity, and fears of change, Maboroshi—meaning \"illusion\"—is a dazzling sophomore feature from director Mari Okada—whose 2018 debut Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms won accolades around the globe—and one that firmly establishes her as one of the most exciting creators working in animation today.\n\nRustin\n\nDirected by George C. Wolfe (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom), this biopic explores the life of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. While perhaps best known as one of the chief organizers of 1963's March on Washington, Rustin was also openly, unapologetically gay at a time when that was phenomenally rare—and the film doesn't shy away from how that alienated many of the people he worked with, his sexuality often seen as a threat to the movement. A much-needed spotlight on an overlooked but pivotal figure in the Civil Rights Movement, elevated by a central performance from a spectacularly well-cast Colman Domingo as Rustin himself.\n\nHis House\n\nFleeing war-torn South Sudan, Bol (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are now living in a run-down house at the edge of London, harassed by their neighbors even as they try to fit in. The couple are also haunted by the lives they left behind—both figuratively and (possibly) literally, with visions of their late daughter Nyagak, who did not survive the journey, fading in and out of the walls of their dismal new home. The real horror of His House isn't the strange visions, haunted house, or potential ghosts, though—it’s the bleakness of the lives Bol and Rial are forced into, the hostility and dehumanization of the UK asylum process, the racism both overt and casual, all coupled with the enormous sense of loss they carry with them. Blending the macabre with the mundane, director Remi Weekes delivers a tense, challenging film that will haunt viewers as much as its characters.\n\nThe Black Book\n\nPaul Edima (Richard Mofe-Damijo) lives a peaceful life as a church deacon, trying to atone for—or at least forget—his former deeds as a highly trained special agent. Plans to leave his violent and bloody past behind fall apart when his son is framed for a murder and then killed by corrupt police, forcing him to fall back on old skills as he seeks vengeance. Shades of Taken, yes, but it's director Editi Effiong's raw energy and fresh takes on familiar action movie formulas that—backed by one of the highest budgets in \"Nollywood\" history—have this gritty outing topping the most-watched lists as far afield as South Korea. Expand your cinematic horizons and see what the fuss is about.\n\nThe Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\n\nIgnore its 41-minute runtime and set aside any arguments over whether its brevity \"counts\" as a movie—this fantastic outing sees Wes Anderson adapt a Roald Dahl work for the first time since 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the result is just as brilliant. Rather than stop-motion, as with Mr. Fox, this is a live-action affair headlined by a top tier performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as the eponymous Henry Sugar, a bored rich man who gains a strange power and ultimately uses it to better the world. With a broader cast including Dev Patel, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley, and shot with all of Anderson's trademark aesthetic sensibilities, this really is a wonderful story. And, if you're still bothered by the short run time, take solace in the fact that this forms a tetraptych with The Rat Catcher, The Swan, and Poison; 15-minute shorts with same cast, directed by Anderson, and all adapting other Dahl tales in his signature style.\n\nEldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate\n\nCentered on the eponymous Berlin nightclub, this documentary explores the lives of LGBTQ+ people during the interwar years, from the roaring 1920s through the rise of the Nazis and into the horrors of World War II. With a blend of archival footage, recreations, and first-person accounts, director Benjamin Cantu paints a picture of gleeful decadence, the Eldorado as an almost hallowed ground where performers and patrons alike experimented with gender expression and were free to openly display their sexuality. It's an ode to what was lost, but with an eye on the bizarre contradictions of the age, where openly gay club-goers would wear their own Nazi uniforms as the years went by. Everything the Nazis Hate is emotionally challenging viewing in places, but it serves up an important slice of queer history that many will be completely unaware of.\n\nMarry My Dead Body\n\nWu Ming-han (Greg Hsu) is not a great guy. A homophobic police officer, his life—and prejudices—are changed when he picks up an unassuming red envelope while investigating a case. Now bound under “ghost marriage” customs to Mao Mao (Austin Lin), a gay man who died under mysterious circumstances, Wu has to solve his “husband's” death before he can get on with his life. Directed by Cheng Wei-hao, better known for his thrillers and horror movies, Marry My Dead Body sees the Taiwanese director bring his supernatural stylings to this ghostly absurdist comedy for a film that transcends borders.\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone\n\nDrug dealer Fontaine (John Boyega) got shot to death last night. So why has he just woken up in bed as if nothing happened? That existential question leads Fontaine and two unlikely allies—prostitute Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) and pimp Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx)—to uncovering a vast conspiracy centered on a Black-majority town called The Glen, where people are kept mollified by hypnotic rap music, dumbed down with drug-laced fried chicken and grape juice, and preached into obedience at church. But who’s using the town as a petri dish, and why is there a cloning lab buried underground? This lethally sharp satire from writer and debut director Juel Taylor masterfully blends genres, from the use of visual motifs and dated clichés from 1970s Blaxploitation cinema to its frequent steps into sci-fi territory and laugh-out-loud comedy. But it’s the powerhouse performances from its central cast that mark this as one to watch.\n\nNimona\n\nShapeshifter Nimona can become anything she wants, a gift that causes people to fear and shun her. If society is going to treat her like a villain, she's going to be one, so she decides to become the sidekick of the hated black knight, Ballister Blackheart. Unfortunately for the aspiring menace, Blackheart isn't quite the monster he's made out to be, and he instead tries to rein in Nimona's more murderous tendencies as he seeks to clear his name of a crime he didn't commit—and face down his old friend Ambrosius Goldenloin in the process. Adapted from N. D. Stevenson's groundbreaking graphic novel, Nimona is more than just another fanciful fantasy—it's a tale of outsiders and exiles, people trying to do right even when their community rejects them, and the joy of finding their own little band along the way. After an almost decade-long journey to the screen, this dazzlingly animated movie has become an instant classic.\n\nThe Boys in the Band\n\nSet in New York City in 1968, The Boys in the Band is a snapshot of gay life a year before Stonewall brought LGBTQ+ rights to mainstream attention. When Michael (Jim Parsons, fresh from The Big Bang Theory) hosts a birthday party for his best frenemy Harold (Zachary Quinto), he’s expecting a night of drinks, dancing, and gossip with their inner circle—until Alan, Michael’s straight friend from college, turns up, desperate to share something. As the night wears on, personalities clash, tempers fray, and secrets threaten to come to the surface in director Joe Mantello’s tense character study. Adapted for the screen by Mart Crowley, author of the original stage play, this period piece manages to be as poignant an exploration of queer relationships and identities as ever.\n\nCargo\n\nIn a world already ravaged by a zombie-like plague, Andy Rose (Martin Freeman) only wants to keep his family safe, sticking to Australia’s rural back roads to avoid infection. After his wife is tragically bitten, and infects him in turn, Andy is desperate to find a safe haven for his infant daughter, Rosie. With a mere 48 hours until he succumbs himself, Andy finds an ally in Thoomi (Simone Landers), an Aboriginal girl looking to protect her own rabid father. But with threats from paranoid survivalists and Aboriginal communities hunting the infected, it may already be too late. A unique twist on the zombie apocalypse, Cargo abandons the familiar urban landscapes of the genre for the breathtaking wilds of Australia and offers a slower, character-led approach to the end of the world.\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio\n\nThe modern master of the macabre brings the wooden would-be boy to life like never before in this exquisitely animated take on Pinocchio. In a stop-motion masterpiece that hews closer to the original 1880s tale by Carlo Collodi than the sanitized Disney version, Guillermo del Toro adds his own signature touch and compelling twists to the classic story that make it darkly enchanting—expect a Blue Fairy closer to a biblically accurate many-eyed angel and a Terrible Dogfish more like a kaiju. It’s the decision to transplant the tale to World War II that’s most affecting though. Cast against the rise of fascism, with Gepetto mourning the loss of his son, the film is packed with complex themes of mortality and morality that will haunt audiences long after the credits roll. If that doesn't sell you, perhaps the fact that it won Best Animated Feature at the 2023 Academy Awards will.\n\nCall Me Chihiro\n\nAn idyllic slice-of-life movie with a twist, Call Me Chihiro follows a former sex worker—the eponymous Chihiro, played by Kasumi Arimura—after she moves to a seaside town to work in a bento restaurant. This isn’t a tale of a woman on the run or trying to escape her past—Chihiro is refreshingly forthright and unapologetic, and her warmth and openness soon begin to change the lives of her neighbors. Directed by Rikiya Imaizumi, this is an intimate, heartfelt character drama that alternates between moments of aching loneliness and sheer joy, packed with emotional beats that remind viewers of the importance of even the smallest connections.\n\nThe Sea Beast\n\nIt's easy to imagine that the elevator pitch for The Sea Beast was “Moby Dick meets How to Train Your Dragon”—and who wouldn’t be compelled by that? Set in a fantasy world where oceanic leviathans terrorize humanity, those who hunt down the giant monsters are lauded as heroes. Jacob Holland (voiced by Karl Urban) is one such hero, adopted son of the legendary Captain Crowe and well on the way to building his own legacy as a monster hunter—a journey disrupted by stowaway Maisie Brumble (Zaris-Angel Hator), who has her own ambitions to take on the sea beasts. However, after an attempt to destroy the colossal Red Bluster goes disastrously wrong, Jacob and Maisie are stranded on an island filled with the creatures, and they find that the monsters may not be quite so monstrous after all. A rollicking sea-bound adventure directed by Chris Williams—of Big Hero 6 and Moana fame—it secured its standing as one of Netflix’s finest movies with a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars.\n\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\n\nDaniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc in this brilliant follow-up to 2019’s phenomenal whodunnit, Knives Out. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a fiendishly sharp new case for “the Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths,” taking Blanc to a Greek island getaway for a reclusive tech billionaire and his collection of friends and hangers-on, where a planned murder mystery weekend takes a deadly turn. While totally accessible for newcomers, fans of the first film will also be rewarded with some deeper character development for Blanc, a role that’s shaping up to be as iconic for Craig as 007. As cleverly written and meticulously constructed as its predecessor, and featuring the kind of all-star cast—Edward Norton! Janelle Monáe! Kathryn Hahn! Leslie Odom Jr.! Jessica Henwick! Madelyn Cline! Kate Hudson! Dave Bautista!—that cinema dreams are made of, Glass Onion might be the best thing Netflix has dropped all year.\n\nThe Wonder\n\nFlorence Pugh dazzles in this not-quite-horror film from Oscar-winning director Sebastián Lelio. Set in 1862, English nurse Lib Wright (Pugh) is sent to Ireland to observe Anna O’Donnell, a girl who claims to have not eaten in four months, subsisting instead on “manna from heaven.” Still grieving the loss of her own child, Lib is torn between investigating the medical impossibility and growing concern for Anna herself. Amid obstacles in the form of Anna’s deeply religious family and a local community that distrusts her, Lib’s watch descends into a tense, terrifying experience. Based on a book of the same name by Emma Donoghue, The Wonder is a beautiful yet bleakly shot period piece that explores the all-too-mortal horrors that unquestioning religious fervor and family secrets can wreak.\n\nRRR\n\nOne of India’s biggest films of all time, RRR (or Rise, Roar, Revolt) redefines the notion of cinematic spectacle. Set in 1920, the historical epic follows real-life Indian revolutionaries Alluri Sitrama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) but fictionalizes their lives and actions. Although they come from very different walks of life, their similarities draw them together as they face down sadistic governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his cruel wife, Catherine (Alison Doody). No mere period fluff, RRR is a bold, exciting, and often explosive piece of filmmaking that elevates its heroes to near-mythological status. Director S. S. Rajamouli deploys brilliantly shot action scenes—and an exquisitely choreographed dance number—that grab viewers’ attention and refuse to let go. Whether you’re a longtime fan of Indian cinema or just looking for an action flick beyond the Hollywood norm, RRR is not to be missed.\n\nI Lost My Body\n\nAn award winner at Cannes in 2019, this tale of burgeoning young love, obsession, and autonomous body parts is every bit as weird as you might expect for a French adult animated film. Director Jérémy Clapin charts the life of Naoufel, a Moroccan immigrant in modern-day France who falls for the distant Gabrielle, and Naoufel’s severed hand, which makes its way across the city to try to reconnect. With intersecting timelines and complex discussions about fate, I Lost My Body is often mind-bending yet always captivating, and Clapin employs brilliantly detailed animation and phenomenal color choices throughout. Worth watching in both the original French and the solid English dub featuring Dev Patel and Alia Shawkat, this one dares you to make sense of it all.\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nFrustrated by the world’s collective inaction on existential threats like climate change? Maybe don’t watch Don’t Look Up, director Adam McKay’s satirical black comedy. When two low-level astronomers discover a planet-killing comet on a collision course with Earth, they try to warn the authorities—only to be met with a collective “meh.” Matters only get worse when they attempt to leak the news themselves and have to navigate vapid TV hosts, celebrities looking for a signature cause, and an indifferent public. A bleakly funny indictment of our times, bolstered by a star-studded cast fronted by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, Don’t Look Up is, somewhat depressingly, one of the best portraits of humanity since Idiocracy.",

For those who've never picked up a controller, the series follows half-demon devil hunter Dante, a stylish slayer with a penchant for slicing up hell's worst offenders. This eight-episode spectacular sees Dante (voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch) clashing with the horrific White Rabbit (Hoon Lee), a twisted monster aiming to tear down the barrier between Earth and hell. Animation fans will also appreciate one of the final performances from the venerable, sadly-passed Kevin Conroy as the villainous US Vice President Baines. Devil May Cry may be unashamedly in love with its own early 2000s origins—as evidenced by a soundtrack filled with songs from the likes of Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach—but this slickly animated action masterpiece is a hellishly good time.\n\nThe Residence\n\nThe latest outing from Shondaland, this satisfyingly twisty whodunnit finds Orange Is the New Black's Uzo Aduba in unassailable top form as Cordelia Cupp, a brilliant but quirky detective—and bird-watcher, which proves important—called in when White House chief usher AB Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito) is found dead on-site midway through a state dinner with Australian dignitaries. While aides are keen to write it off as suicide, Cupp isn't convinced—which means locking everyone (including the actual Kylie Minogue) in while she investigates. It's all brilliantly shot, with the White House itself a pivotal character (at times becoming a doll house diorama where each room continues to play out their own tableaux), but it’s the phenomenal cast that makes this dark comedy top viewing.\n\nAdolescence\n\nA quiet English town. 6 am. Police raid the house of Jamie Miller on suspicion of murdering an innocent girl. Jamie is 13 years old. A shocking mini-series, this isn't a whodunit, but a whydunit. Its four episodes—each masterfully shot in a single real-time take—explore how boys are radicalized online to hate women, and the horrifying effects it has. The powerhouse cast includes cocreator and writer Stephen Graham (Bodies, A Thousand Blows) as Jamie's father Eddie, Ashley Walters (Bulletproof) as Detective Boscombe, the arresting officer and investigator of Jamie's crime, and Erin Doherty (The Crown) as the psychologist evaluating Jamie. Each brings this incredibly difficult material to life, but it's newcomer Owen Cooper as Jamie who most astounds, turning from petrified to cheeky to vitriolic in a terrifying heartbeat. Adolescence is harrowing but important viewing.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nOriginally released on Paramount+, the latest outing for the Ninja Turtles finds Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello in uncharted territory—openly renowned heroes, cheered on by the people of New York after saving the city during the Mutant Mayhem movie reboot. With the brothers balancing battling evil mutants and shady government agents with learning how to fit in with new friends and allies, it's also the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show to really emphasize the “Teenage” part of the equation. While Tales doesn't replicate the CGI style of the film, its 2D animation feels like a love letter to the heroes-in-a-half-shell's comic book origins, and with arch-nemesis Shredder only teased at the end of Mutant Mayhem, the series is free to explore new and lesser-known enemies from the source material. The result? A fresh take on the Turtles that's as fun for longtime shellheads as it is for new fans.\n\nToxic Town\n\nBased on the real-world Corby toxic waste case, this four-part drama follows the decades-long battle for justice faced by the former steelworking English town, after widespread industrial pollution led to multiple children being born with physical disabilities. Centered largely on the lives of mothers Susan McIntyre (former Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker), Tracey Taylor (Aimee Lou Wood), and Maggie Mahon (Claudia Jessie), Toxic Town fiercely explores how far the community had to go for justice and how low the people responsible would stoop to avoid culpability. A searing, powerful, heart-wrenching drama that will—and should—leave you absolutely furious at corporate greed.\n\nPantheon\n\nOriginally an AMC+ show, both seasons of Pantheon are now available on Netflix. Good timing too, since its nightmarish scenario of digitally uploaded human consciousnesses and exploration of the impact such technology would have on society feels worryingly prescient. With plot threads weaving between isolated Maddie Kim, whose dead father may have been reborn as an “Uploaded Intelligence,” Caspian Keyes, a genius teenager whose entire life is a Truman Show–style lie, and Vinod Chanda, an engineer investigating UI, this hard sci-fi outing—based on the short fiction of Ken Liu—offers a dark examination of virtual immortality. A uniquely brilliant adult animated series.\n\nZero Day\n\nCards on the table: A significant part of the appeal here is seeing the iconic Robert De Niro in his first major English-language TV role (he previously appeared in the Argentinian Nada, aka Nothing). He doesn't disappoint with his performance as former US president George Mullen—pulled out of retirement to oversee a commission investigating a colossal cyberattack that left thousands of Americans dead and the terrifying warning that \"this will happen again\"—commanding the screen with his trademark gravitas. Director Lesli Linka Glatter wrings great drama from the whodunit of it all (Russians? hackers? hedge fund bros?), but with Mullen handed unprecedented powers to track down the culprits, the real nail-biting moments come from its suddenly timely explorations of abuses of power. With a powerhouse cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lizzy Caplan, and Jesse Plemons, Zero Day is an engaging political thriller, and at six episodes it makes for a great binge-watch.\n\nApple Cider Vinegar\n\nInfluencers have been known to hawk nonsense diets and spurious “wellness” regimens, but few have ever done it like Belle Gibson, the real-life Australian influencer who went as far as faking brain cancer for attention. And while she hailed alternative diets and whole foods for keeping her nonexistent illness at bay—launching an app and cookbook in the process—actual cancer sufferers paid the price for her extreme narcissism and greed. This dramatized limited series—“a true-ish story … based on a lie,” as Netflix puts it—makes for uncomfortably gripping viewing as it charts the rise and fall of Gibson (Kaitlyn Dever, with a flawless Aussie accent) and her rivalry with Milla Blake (Alycia Debnam-Cary), a fellow influencer and actual cancer patient. Better than doomscrolling reels on Instagram or TikTok, and a reminder that everyone should be a lot more skeptical of anything influencers are shilling on social media.\n\nThe Night Agent\n\nSpecial agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) is back, and the stakes have never been higher. While the first season of The Night Agent wove a compelling spy drama out of the idea of a mole at the heart of America's intelligence services, the newly arrived second season takes a more global approach—Sutherland hunts down a stolen chemical weapon project, drawing him back into the orbit of tech savant and sometime love interest Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), while Iranian diplomatic aide Noor Taheri (Arienne Mandi) offers secrets to the CIA in return for asylum, and a deposed Eastern European dictator aims to manipulate everything from behind bars. Sure, the show’s mix of politics and spook work won’t surprise genre diehards, but it weaves together its many influences—and many more plot threads—into a supremely entertaining thriller.\n\nAsura\n\nThe four Takezawa sisters are close but have little in common. Eldest Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is already a widow; repressed Takiko (Yû Aoi) and rebellious Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) are always at each other's throats; and second-born Makiko (Machiko Ono) tries to balance keeping the peace with being a housewife and mother to her own two children. Yet when Takiko learns that their father Kotaro (Jun Kunimura) may have a second, secret, family, the sisters’ bonds are put to the test as they struggle to uncover the truth. Asura is far more than a turgid family drama—it's equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, capturing the complexities of the relationships between its quartet of protagonists. Keeping the 1970s setting of Kuniko Mukōda’s original novel allows Palme d’Or– winning director Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters) to craft a gorgeously shot period piece that still feels incredibly timely and modern.\n\nCastlevania: Nocturne\n\nIn the midst of the French Revolution, citizens rise up against a parasitic ruling class—but vampire hunter Richter Belmont and his magic-wielding allies Maria and Annette are more concerned with what's literally bleeding the people dry. The first season of this grisly adult animated series saw the team coming together to face the rise of a \"Vampire Messiah\" prophesied to devour the sun, but the new second season ratchets up the action as the heroes team with Alucard, son of Dracula, to try to restore light to the world. Let's just say the stakes (sorry) have never been higher. While Nocturne's second season has some closer links to the previous Castlevania animated series, it still works perfectly well on its own, delivering high quality animation, brilliant action, and a fantastic cast of characters to sink your teeth into (sorry, again).\n\nSakamoto Days\n\nTaro Sakamoto used to be the worst of the worst, a hit man par excellence, his lethal skills making him a legendary figure in the criminal underworld. Then he fell in love, got married, and retired to run a convenience store with his wife Aoi and their daughter Hana. Unfortunately, he didn't exactly leave his old job on the best of terms, and now a cadre of killers are out for the billion yen bounty on his head. Luckily, Sakamoto's lost none of his skills—even though he has let himself go in other areas—but can he protect his family without breaking Aoi's strict “no killing” rule? Based on the manga by Yuto Suzuki, this comedy-action anime is a blast, and with a new episode each Saturday rather than Netflix's usual drop-it-all-at-once model, it's appointment viewing you won't want to miss.\n\nJentry Chau vs the Underworld\n\nYou know the drill—everyday teenager learns she has superpowers and is destined to fight the forces of darkness. Except Jentry Chau (voiced by Ali Wong) is not like any other teenage girl—she’s known about the supernatural her whole life (her uncontrollable fire powers were a giveaway) and spent a lifetime avoiding it. Sent to study in Korea for her own safety, Jentry is drawn back into the mystic world after being attacked in Seoul by a jiangshi named Ed (Bowen Yang). Brought back to her home in Texas by her great-aunt, Jentry has to survive not only the formidable mogui Mr. Cheng, who intends to drain her soul and powers, but the horrors of high school, culture shock, and the pain of her own past. Taking the “high school is hell” metaphor of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, adding a dash of Gravity Falls’ mystery, and rooting it all in Asian mythology, Jentry Chau vs the Underworld is one of Netflix’s freshest animated shows in years.\n\nSquid Game\n\nProduced in Korea, Squid Game blends Hunger Games and Parasite with a battle-royal-style contest. Hundreds of desperate, broke people are recruited to a contest where they can win enough money to never need to worry about their debts again. All they have to do to win the ₩45.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot is complete six children’s games. But it’s not that simple: All the games have a twist, and very few people make it out alive. Squid Game is intense, brutal, and often very graphic, but it is also completely gripping. After the show became a cultural phenomenon in 2021, fans waited what felt like an eternity for another season. That second season finally dropped on December 26.\n\nQueer Eye\n\nA reformatted Fab Five return, ready to change the lives of 10 new heroes. Relocating to Las Vegas, the ninth season of Queer Eye sees Karamo, Tan, Antoni, Jonathan, and new host Jeremiah Brent—taking Bobby Berk's seat as the design whiz—helping a retired showgirl regain her sparkle, organizing a dream wedding for new parents, and, in possibly their strangest case yet, teaching a magic dragon to shed his scaly exterior. No, really. Netflix's most feel-good show.\n\nNo Good Deed\n\nTake Selling Sunset and add a grisly tragicomic twist and you just about have No Good Deed. A dark comedy from Liz Feldman, creator of Dead to Me, this eight-part series starts with Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano) putting their gorgeous home on the market, and descends into darker territory as prospective buyers go to ever more desperate attempts to get their hands on the house, nosy neighbors interfere, and the grisly history of the house itself threatens to come to light. Buoyed by a stellar cast including Teyonah Parris, Abbi Jacobson, Luke Wilson, and Denis Leary, this is a glossy, witty, and possibly only slightly exaggerated take on the brutality of the Los Angeles property market.\n\nA Man on the Inside\n\nThe latest show from comedy mastermind Michael Schur (The Good Place, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine), A Man on the Inside features Ted Danson as Charles Nieuwendyk, a retired engineering professor who's lost all direction since his wife passed. But when private investigator Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) needs a man of his demographic to go undercover in a retirement community to investigate allegations of resident abuse, Charles may find an unlikely new lease on life—if he can figure out how to use his smartphone, that is. Reflecting on end-of-life realities as much as it plays up Charles' fish-out-of-water situation, it's a show that's equal parts poignant, melancholic, and achingly funny—and it's based on a true story, to boot.\n\nBlack Doves\n\nHelen Webb (Keira Knightley) is wife to the UK defense secretary, mother to two children, and bored with her picture-perfect life. Spectacular cover then, since she's actually a spy for the mercenary organization Black Doves, selling state secrets to the highest bidder. But when her real love Jason (Andrew Koji) is killed, Helen is determined to find out who killed him and why—and her pursuit of the truth threatens both her public and private lives. Paired with assassin and old friend Sam (Ben Whishaw, in a very different spy role to his turn in the James Bond films) at the behest of stern operator Mrs. Reed (Sarah Lancashire), Helen's obsession could have led to a dour, gritty thriller, but Black Doves bucks the grim-dark trend to serve up a pulpy, colorful outing with enough heart to balance its violence. At only six episodes (with a second season already confirmed), it's a brisk watch too.\n\nArcane\n\nAnimated series based on video games can run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. Yet Arcane stood out by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between is entirely accessible. The second and final season, released in a trio of movie-length blocks of three episodes apiece, escalates the conflict between the warring factions but never loses its central focus on the fractured relationship between sisters. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane is one of the best animated series in years—and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it.\n\nCobra Kai\n\nPicking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence’s iconic fight at the end of the first Karate Kid movie, Cobra Kai initially follows a washed-up Johnny as he reopens the Cobra Kai karate dojo, finding new purpose after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridueña, Blue Beetle) in a fight. Over the course of six seasons, the stakes get higher—and frankly, increasingly, gloriously, ludicrous—as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California. Alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity, and everything gears toward a global battle for karate supremacy. It’s all a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks, but thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, it’s a retro-styled delight.\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nIf there's a West Wing-shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat—a tense geopolitical thriller elevated by a superb central performance by The Americans' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate's role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis while also navigating her fraying \"special relationship\" with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell). The second season picks up from a literally explosive cliffhanger and propels Kate into a political conspiracy—and a potential promotion to vice president. Some of the twists along the way are faintly ridiculous, but The Diplomat has become one of Netflix's biggest hits in recent years, and a third season is already in the works.\n\nNobody Wants This\n\nStop us if you've heard this one before: An agnostic sex podcaster and a Rabbi walk into a party … OK, it's not quite a setup for a joke, but rather for a sharp romcom—one based, in exaggerated form, on creator Erin Foster's own experiences. Joanne (Kristen Bell, The Good Place) is cynical and burned out on modern dating, even as it provides her material for the increasingly successful podcast she hosts with her sister Morgan (Justine Lupe). When she meets young, handsome Noah (Adam Brody, The OC), the attraction is instant and mutual—except he's just broken up with the stereotypical Nice Jewish Girl™ his family expected him to settle down with. Yet as the pair swirl through each other's lives, the show proves it's less about culture clash than it is exploring what the seemingly mismatched pair are willing to change and sacrifice to make their burgeoning relationship work. With sizzling chemistry between its leads, Nobody Wants This is a romcom with an emphasis on the romance.\n\nHeartstopper\n\nOne of the most joyful shows on Netflix returns for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt queer romance. In the long-awaited third season, things heat up between the central couple, with Charlie (Joe Locke) preparing to say three little words to Nick (Kit Connor) for the first time, while Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao (William Gao) try to have the perfect romantic summer before Elle starts art college. Heartstopper's return also sheds some of its earlier cloying tendencies, growing up alongside its talented young cast and giving them more serious material to work with, tackling more mature themes of sex, eating disorders, and gender dysphoria—all without losing the warmth and charm that made audiences fall in love with the show in the first place. The show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and one that everyone needs to watch, whatever their sexuality.\n\nBaby Reindeer\n\nStalking is no laughing matter, which makes this dramatized—and highly controversial—retelling of Scottish comedian Richard Gadd's own real-life experiences more than a little uncomfortable. Adapted from Gadd's one-man stage show of the same name, Baby Reindeer follows Donny (Gadd, playing a fictionalized version of himself) after he meets Martha (Jessica Gunning) at the pub he works at. Despite claiming to be a lawyer, Martha can't afford a drink—and a sympathetic gesture on Donny's part opens the door to increasingly obsessive and dangerous behavior as she proceeds to infiltrate his life. It's shockingly honest and self-aware in places—does Donny, and by extension Gadd, on some level relish the attention of his stalker? Are his occasional moments of kindness and warmth toward Martha inviting her further in? Is he using her, finding her a strange source of material for his stand-up career? A fiercely paced seven episodes, shot more like a horror movie, this Emmy-winning miniseries explores trauma and intimacy, shame and masculinity, and how society often silences the victims of abuse.\n\nThe Boyfriend\n\n\"Anyone can fall in love with anyone\" is the opening narration to The Boyfriend, Japan's first same-sex dating show—a bold and progressive statement that reflects the shifting tide of opinion in the country. Throwing nine single men together in an idyllic beach house for a summer and charging them with running a coffee truck, the over-arching concept is to see who'll pair up, but the series is as interested in exploring the friendships that emerge between the cast as it is the romantic relationships. Unlike Western dating shows, there are no scandals, no dramatic twists, no betrayals, and the “challenges” are adorably focused on confessing feelings. The gentleness of it all adds an almost relaxing quality, with the men discussing their emotions—and the nature of being queer in Japan—earnestly. An absolutely joyful example of reality TV.\n\nKleo\n\nIf you’re pining for more Killing Eve, then this German thriller may be the next best thing. Set in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the series follows the eponymous Kleo (Jella Haase), a Stasi assassin imprisoned by her agency on false treason charges. Released after the fall of the Berlin Wall, she seeks revenge on her former handlers—but West German detective Sven (Dimitrij Schaad), the only witness to her last kill, may have something to say about that. As dark and violent as you'd expect given the period and the themes of betrayal and vengeance, Kleo is lightened by its oft-deranged sense of humor and a charismatic lead duo who brilliantly bounce off one another—chemistry that's only heightened in the second season as Kleo's pursuit of her old allies intensifies, attracting attention from international spy agencies in the aftermath of the Cold War.\n\nSweet Home\n\nBased on the Korean webcomic by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home offers a very different vision of apocalyptic end times—rather than pandemics, disasters, or even zombies, this posits an end of the world brought about by people's transformation into grotesque monsters, each unique and seemingly based on their deepest desires when they were human. The first season is a masterclass in claustrophobic horror, as the residents of an isolated, run-down apartment building—chiefly suicidal teen Cha Hyun-su (Song Kang), former firefighter Seo Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young), and Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook), who may be a brutal gangster—battle for survival. The second and third seasons explore what remains of the wider world, delving into the true nature of both monster and man—and if there's any hope for what remains of humanity. With phenomenal effects work blending prosthetics, CGI, and even stop-motion animation for some disturbingly juddering creatures, this stands apart from the horror crowd.\n\nStar Trek Prodigy\n\nParamount+'s loss remains Netflix's gain, as the streamer's license rescue of this great Star Trek spin-off warps into its second season. After escaping a distant prison planet and becoming Starfleet cadets under the watchful eye of Star Trek Voyager's Admiral Janeway (voiced by the venerable Kate Mulgrew), the ragtag crew—led by aspiring captain Dal R'El and bolstered by astrolinguist Gwyndala, engineer Jankom Pog, energy being Zero, scientist Rok-Tahk, and indestructible, gelatinous Murf—find themselves cast through time on the most dangerous mission of their young lives. While aimed at younger audiences and intended as an intro to the wider Trek universe and its ethics, Prodigy packs in plenty for older Trekkers to appreciate, particularly with a slate of returning Star Trek legends voiced by their original actors. Prodigy is something of a sleeper hit, but one of the best Trek shows in years.\n\nSupacell\n\nOne by one, five Black Londoners awaken to strange superpowers. Struggling father Andre (Eric Kofi-Abrefa) develops superstrength, nurse Sabrina (Nadine Mills) unleashes phenomenal telekinetic might, drug dealer Rodney (Calvin Demba) races at superspeed, and wannabe gang leader Tazer (Josh Tedeku) turns invisible. But it's Michael (Tosin Cole, Doctor Who) who may be the most pivotal, realizing he can leap through time and space and learning he only has three months to save his fiancée's life. Created by Andrew “Rapman” Onwubolu, Supacell is a show about superpowers, but not necessarily superheroes, with its fantastic cast offering up a far more realistic and human exploration of now-familiar ideas than anything you'll find in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And the mystery of why—and how—only Black people seem to be gaining powers builds up to a more powerful punch than an Asgardian god of thunder. A smart, modern, and refreshing take on the genre.\n\nThe Good Place\n\nAfter suffering an improbable and humiliating death, Eleanor (Kristen Bell) finds herself in “The Good Place,” a perfect neighborhood inhabited by the world's worthiest people. The only problem? She's not meant to be there. Desperate to not be sent to “The Bad Place,” she tries to correct her behavior in the afterlife, with the help of her assigned soulmate, philosophy professor Chidi (William Jackson Harper). A twist at the end of the first season remains one of the best ever, while the show's ability to sprinkle ethical and philosophical precepts into a sitcom format is frankly astounding. With a sensational cast rounded out by Manny Jacinto, Jameela Jamil, D'Arcy Carden, and Ted Danson, The Good Place more than earns its place in the good place of TV history.\n\nBridgerton\n\nStill ranking as one of Netflix’s most-watched series ever, Bridgerton is set during the Regency period in England and follows the powerful Bridgerton family as they navigate love, marriage, and scandal—with most of the latter stirred up by the gossip columns penned by the anonymous Lady Whistledown. Created for screen by Chris Van Dusen and executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, this incredibly bingeable and shockingly entertaining show is based on a series of novels by Julia Quinn, with each season focusing on a different branch of the Bridgerton tree. The third and latest season sees the spotlight fall on the long-simmering relationship between wallflower Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), a pairing that threatens to reveal powerful secrets that have been bubbling away since the very first episode.\n\n3 Body Problem\n\nIn 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world—and humanity’s continued existence may rely on there being no “game over.” Game of Thrones’ creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu’s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza González, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga.\n\nRipley\n\nPerhaps best known nowadays from 1999’s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith’s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman’s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle—and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date.\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender\n\nA talented young cast bring to life the tale of Aang (Gordon Cormier), the latest in a long line of avatars who can control all four cardinal elements, but is frozen in time for a century when his world needed him most. Awakened by new friends Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), he sets about continuing his training as the Avatar in an attempt to restore balance, all the while pursued by the relentless Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu), heir to the imperialist Fire Nation that has conquered the world. Consider this a cautious recommendation—the original animated version, also on Netflix, remains superior—but Netflix's live action Avatar remake serves up scale and spectacle, without betraying the heart of the classic show. It's also already confirmed for two more seasons, so viewers can look forward to the complete saga without the now-familiar Netflix cancellation worries.\n\nThe Legend of Korra\n\nIf you're still not sold on the live-action Avatar, this sequel to the original series is well worth your time. Set 70 years after the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra explores how Aang's world has progressed after decades of relative peace. When Korra, the new Avatar, moves to Republic City to complete her training under the tutelage of Tenzin—Aang's son, now with a family of his own—she finds herself and new friends Mako and Bolin caught in the growing tensions between element benders and the Equalist movement, who claim the unpowered are an oppressed class. As the series progresses over its four seasons, The Legend of Korra proves itself a very different beast than its predecessor, exploring political themes and social prejudices in deeper—and often darker—detail, while also expanding the more fantastic elements of the universe and revealing the origins of the first Avatar. Even more brilliantly animated, and with a unique 1920s inspired aesthetic, Korra is a show that grew up alongside its audience, and is all the stronger for it.\n\nBeef\n\nEver been cut off in traffic? Ever had it happen when you’re having a really bad day? Ever just wanted to take the low road, chase the person down and make them pay?! Then—after a few deep breaths—Beef is the show for you. It's a pressure valve for every petty grievance you’ve ever suffered, following rich Amy (Ali Wong) and struggling Danny (Steven Yeun) as they escalate a road rage encounter into a vengeance-fueled quest to destroy the other. Yet Beef is more than a city-wide revenge thriller—it's a biting look at how crushing modern life can be, particularly in its LA setting, where extravagant wealth brushes up against inescapable poverty and seemingly no one is truly happy. Part dramedy, part therapy, Beef is a bad example of conflict resolution but a cathartic binge watch that clearly resonates—as evidenced by its growing clutch of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Limited Series.\n\nLoudermilk\n\nSomething of a sleeper hit for years—its first two seasons debuted on AT&T's now-defunct pay TV channel Audience in 2017, before its third season appeared over on Amazon—all three seasons of this bleak comedy are now available on Netflix. Ron Livingston stars as Sam Loudermilk, a vitriolic former music critic and recovering alcoholic who proves almost pathologically incapable of holding his tongue when faced with life's small frustrations—a personality type possibly ill-suited to leading others through addiction support groups. It's dark in places, and its central character is deliberately unlikeable, but smart writing and smarter performances shape this into something of an acerbic anti-Frasier.\n\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off\n\nAdapted from the beloved graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, animated by one of the most exciting and dynamic studios in Japan, and voiced by the entire returning cast of director Edgar Wright's 2010 live-action adaption, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would have been cult gold even if it was a straight retelling of its eponymous slacker's battles against lover Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes. Yet somehow, in a world devoid of surprises, this packs in killer twists from the very first episode, making for a show that's as fresh and exciting as ever. Saying anything else would ruin it—just watch.\n\nPluto\n\nThink you know Astro Boy? Think again. In 2003, Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 20th Century Boys) updated original creator Osamu Tezuka's hugely influential \"The Greatest Robot on Earth\" story arc for his manga Pluto, opting for a more adult approach. The focus shifts from the heroic boy robot to grizzled cybernetic detective Gesicht as he investigates a series of murders of both humans and robots, each victim left with makeshift horns crammed into their heads. Meanwhile, Atom (Astro's Japanese name) is recast as a former peace ambassador, effectively a propaganda tool rolled out at the end of the 39th Central Asian War, still dealing with trauma from the experience. This adaptation is not only a faithful recreation of Urasawa's retelling, but is stunningly animated to a standard rarely seen in Netflix's original anime productions. With eight episodes, each around an hour long, this is as prestigious as any live-action thriller the streamer has produced, and a testament to both Tezuka and Urasawa's respective geniuses.\n\nBlue Eye Samurai\n\nIn the 17th Century, Japan enforced its \"sakoku\" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between—so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated—which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic—and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.\n\nPending Train\n\nNetflix: License one of Japan’s best SF dramas in years. Also Netflix: Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer. Which is where WIRED comes in—Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn’t sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers’ first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group—including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae—begins to realize that there may be a reason they’ve been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, Pending Train offers a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go.\n\nOne Piece\n\nMark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from “awful” to “not too bad,” Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans’ fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda’s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast Iñaki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season—including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)—all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.\n\nThe Chosen One\n\nBased on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life—and potentially the world—changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix's expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There's an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there's another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader—also worth a watch, but don't get them confused!)\n\nAlice in Borderland\n\nWhen slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) is mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills give him an edge navigating a series of lethal games that test intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after barely scraping through several rounds, Arisu is no closer to uncovering the secrets of this strange borderland, or to finding a way home—and the stakes are about to get even higher. Not only are Arisu and his allies Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), Kuina (Aya Asahina), and Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) faced with another gauntlet of sadistic games, but they find themselves caught between rival card suit “courts” vying for power—and not everyone can be trusted.\n\nWith its willingness to kill off main characters at a moment’s notice, the first season of this gripping adaptation of Haro Aso’s manga kept viewers on tenterhooks throughout. As the long-awaited second season leans further into its twisted Alice in Wonderland imagery, expect more shocking developments in this taut thriller.\n\nRussian Doll\n\nIn Russian Doll, Nadia has one very big problem: Time keeps breaking around her. Season one finds Nadia—played by Natasha Lyonne, who is also a cocreator on the show—dying at her own birthday party, only to wake up there over and over again, trapped in a Groundhog Day-style loop until she can unravel her personalized knot in the space-time continuum. Things only get stranger in season two, where Nadia finds herself traveling back in time to 1982 and inhabiting the body of her own mother—currently heavily pregnant with Nadia herself. Both seasons are funny and thought-provoking, reflecting on personal and generational trauma, all without overegging the potential for philosophical musing.\n\nLupin\n\nArsène Lupin, the belle epoque burglar created by French novelist Maurice Leblanc in the early 1900s, is reinvented as Assane Diop, a first-generation Frenchman with a mania for Lupin books and a grudge against the powerful forces who decades ago framed his father for a theft he didn’t commit—and led him to die in prison. Pairing drones, social media bots, and hacking skills with traditional tools of the trade like fake beards, picklocks, and quick wits, Diop hunts down his adversaries as he searches for the truth about his father’s fate. In his spare time, Diop also tries to patch together a crumbling marriage and build a better rapport with his son. Worth watching in the French original, this five-episode series’ strength lies in the dialog, the character development, and the charismatic performance of Omar Sy as Assane. The actual escapades and daring heists are beautifully choreographed, but a lot of the mechanics—how a certain piece of legerdemain worked, when an impenetrable building was infiltrated—are left to the viewer's imagination.",

    "content": "The biggest news this week is inarguably the Trump administration’s baffling tariffs, which have rattled the global economy, impacting everything from the US tech industry to literal penguins, leaving most of the world wondering what comes next. But if you’re looking for a mystery that doesn’t feel quite so, well, existential, look no further than Indiana University.\n\nOn March 18, the FBI raided the homes of Xiaofeng Wang, a data privacy professor and researcher who worked at the IU for more than 20 years. The same day, according to a termination email viewed by WIRED, Wang was fired from his job, and people soon noticed that he and his wife seemed to have disappeared.\n\nA WIRED investigation found that the university was looking into whether Wang received unreported research funding from China prior to his position being terminated. IU also removed from its website Wang’s profile as well as the profile of his wife, Nianli Ma, who worked as a library systems analyst. An attorney for Wang and Ma say they are “safe,” and Wang has reportedly taken a position at a university in Singapore. As of earlier this week, the couple’s attorney was unaware of any charges against either of them.\n\nThe large language models behind generative AI tools may be black boxes, but one company’s leaky server has provided some accidental insight into how people are using these tools. The short answer? It’s not great. Security researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered an unsecured database with more than 95,000 records linked to South Korea-based image-generation tool GeNomis. The records contained prompts for creating images, as well as some images themselves, which included de-aged pictures of celebrities like Ariana Grande and Beyoncé made to look like children, and what appeared to be AI-generated child sexual abuse material. The GeNomis website went offline hours after WIRED reached out for comment.\n\nAnd that’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories, and stay safe out there.\n\nThe Trump administration has reportedly fired the director of the National Security Agency at the urging of far-right activist Laura Loomer. According to multiple reports, Loomer brought to an Oval Office meeting on Wednesday a list of about a dozen officials she claimed were insufficiently loyal to President Donald Trump. Among them were General Timothy Haugh—who led both the NSA and US Cyber Command—and his civilian deputy, Wendy Noble, who has reportedly also been removed from her post.\n\nAccording to CNN, Loomer specifically targeted Haugh, arguing for his removal because he had been selected by Mark Milley, the former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman. Milley, who publicly clashed with Trump, was quoted in a book by journalist Bob Woodward calling the former president “fascist to the core.” In a post on X, Loomer claimed that Haugh and Noble “have been disloyal to President Trump. That is why they have been fired.”\n\nHaugh’s and Noble’s reported dismissals came just hours after several National Security Council staffers were also forced out following the Oval Office meeting that included Loomer.",

    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "“Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!” With a sly grin that I’d soon come to recognize, Paul Ginsparg quoted Michael Corleone from The Godfather. Ginsparg, a physics professor at Cornell University and a certified MacArthur genius, may have little in common with Al Pacino’s mafia don, but both are united by the feeling that they were denied a graceful exit from what they’ve built.\n\nNearly 35 years ago, Ginsparg created arXiv, a digital repository where researchers could share their latest findings—before those findings had been systematically reviewed or verified. Visit arXiv.org today (it’s pronounced like “archive”) and you’ll still see its old-school Web 1.0 design, featuring a red banner and the seal of Cornell University, the platform’s institutional home. But arXiv’s unassuming facade belies the tectonic reconfiguration it set off in the scientific community. If arXiv were to stop functioning, scientists from every corner of the planet would suffer an immediate and profound disruption. “Everybody in math and physics uses it,” Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. “I scan it every night.”\n\nEvery industry has certain problems universally acknowledged as broken: insurance in health care, licensing in music, standardized testing in education, tipping in the restaurant business. In academia, it’s publishing. Academic publishing is dominated by for-profit giants like Elsevier and Springer. Calling their practice a form of thuggery isn’t so much an insult as an economic observation. Imagine if a book publisher demanded that authors write books for free and, instead of employing in-house editors, relied on other authors to edit those books, also for free. And not only that: The final product was then sold at prohibitively expensive prices to ordinary readers, and institutions were forced to pay exorbitant fees for access.\n\nThe “free editing” academic publishers facilitate is called peer review, the process by which fellow researchers vet new findings. This can take months, even a year. But with arXiv, scientists could post their papers—known, at this unvetted stage, as preprints—for instant and free access to everyone. One of arXiv’s great achievements was “showing that you could divorce the actual transmission of your results from the process of refereeing,” said Paul Fendley, an early arXiv moderator and now a physicist at All Souls College, Oxford. During crises like the Covid pandemic, time-sensitive breakthroughs were disseminated quickly—particularly by bioRxiv and medRxiv, platforms inspired by arXiv—potentially saving, by one study’s estimate, millions of lives.\n\nWhile arXiv submissions aren’t peer-reviewed, they are moderated by experts in each field, who volunteer their time to ensure that submissions meet basic academic standards and follow arXiv’s guidelines: original research only, no falsified data, sufficiently neutral language. Submissions also undergo automated checks for baseline quality control. Without these, pseudoscientific papers and amateur work would flood the platform.\n\nIn 2021, the journal Nature declared arXiv one of the “10 computer codes that transformed science,” praising its role in fostering scientific collaboration. (The article is behind a paywall—unlock it for $199 a year.) By a recent count, arXiv hosts more than 2.6 million papers, receives 20,000 new submissions each month, and has 5 million monthly active users. Many of the most significant discoveries of the 21st century have first appeared on the platform. The “transformers” paper that launched the modern AI boom? Uploaded to arXiv. Same with the solution to the Poincaré conjecture, one of the seven Millennium Prize problems, famous for their difficulty and $1 million rewards. Just because a paper is posted on arXiv doesn’t mean it won’t appear in a prestigious journal someday, but it’s often where research makes its debut and stays openly available. The transformers paper is still routinely accessed via arXiv.\n\nFor scientists, imagining a world without arXiv is like the rest of us imagining one without public libraries or GPS. But a look at its inner workings reveals that it isn’t a frictionless utopia of open-access knowledge. Over the years, arXiv’s permanence has been threatened by everything from bureaucratic strife to outdated code to even, once, a spy scandal. In the words of Ginsparg, who usually redirects interview requests to an FAQ document—on arXiv, no less—and tried to talk me out of visiting him in person, arXiv is “a child I sent off to college but who keeps coming back to camp out in my living room, behaving badly.”\n\nGinsparg and I met over the course of several days last spring in Ithaca, New York, home of Cornell University. I’ll admit, I was apprehensive ahead of our time together. Geoffrey West, a former supervisor of Ginsparg’s at Los Alamos National Laboratory, once described him as “quite a character” who is “infamous in the community” for being “quite difficult.” He also said he was “extremely funny” and a “great guy.” In our early email exchanges, Ginsparg told me, upfront, that stories about arXiv never impress him: “So many articles, so few insights,” he wrote.",

    "content": "Moore designed his pinball machine to complete the analogy to the Turing machine. The starting position of the pinball represents the data on the tape being fed into the Turing machine. Crucially (and unrealistically), the player must be able to adjust the ball’s starting location with infinite precision, meaning that specifying the ball’s location requires a number with an endless procession of numerals after the decimal point. Only in such a number could Moore encode the data of an infinitely long Turing tape.\n\nThen the arrangement of bumpers steers the ball to new positions in a way that corresponds to reading and writing on some Turing machine’s tape. Certain curved bumpers shift the tape one way, making the data stored in distant decimal places more significant in a way reminiscent of chaotic systems, while oppositely curved bumpers do the reverse. The ball’s exit from the bottom of the box marks the end of the computation, with the final location as the result.\n\nMoore equipped his pinball machine setup with the flexibility of a computer—one arrangement of bumpers might calculate the first thousand digits of pi, and another might compute the best next move in a game of chess. But in doing so, he also infused it with an attribute that we might not typically associate with computers: unpredictability.\n\nIn a landmark work in 1936, Alan Turing defined the boundary of computation by describing the key features of a universal computing device, now known as a Turing machine. Photograph: GL Archive/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nSome algorithms stop, outputting a result. But others run forever. (Consider a program tasked with printing the final digit of pi.) Is there a procedure, Turing asked, that can examine any program and determine whether it will stop? This question became known as the halting problem.\n\nTuring showed that no such procedure exists by considering what it would mean if it did. If one machine could predict the behavior of another, you could easily modify the first machine—the one that predicts behavior—to run forever when the other machine halts. And vice versa: It halts when the other machine runs forever. Then—and here’s the mind-bending part—Turing imagined feeding a description of this tweaked prediction machine into itself. If the machine stops, it also runs forever. And if it runs forever, it also stops. Since neither option could be, Turing concluded, the prediction machine itself must not exist.\n\n(His finding was intimately related to a groundbreaking result from 1931, when the logician Kurt Gödel developed a similar way of feeding a self-referential paradox into a rigorous mathematical framework. Gödel proved that mathematical statements exist whose truth cannot be established.)\n\nIn short, Turing proved that solving the halting problem was impossible. The only general way to know if an algorithm stops is to run it for as long as you can. If it stops, you have your answer. But if it doesn’t, you’ll never know whether it truly runs forever, or whether it would have stopped if you’d just waited a bit longer.\n\n“We know that there are these kinds of initial states that we cannot predict ahead of time what it’s going to do,” Wolpert said.\n\nSince Moore had designed his box to mimic any Turing machine, it too could behave in unpredictable ways. The exit of the ball marks the end of a calculation, so the question of whether any particular arrangement of bumpers will trap the ball or steer it to the exit must also be undecidable. “Really, any question about the long-term dynamics of these more elaborate maps is undecidable,” Moore said.",

    "title": "The Switch 2’s GameChat Social Feature Could Revolutionize the Way You Play With Friends",
    "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
    "content": "One of the most exciting features of the Switch 2 is its GameChat, a new social feature that lets up to 12 people share screens, game together, or just talk directly via the console. It puts social features found on platforms like Discord directly onto the console in a way Nintendo’s platforms have yet to do.\n\nGaming is more social than most people give it credit for. Pre-internet, gaming with friends was the sort of thing you’d do together on the couch. After moving online, people were finally able to broaden their social circles to anyone who enjoyed their hobby, and not just whoever lived nearby; apps like Twitch and Discord have made this even easier.\n\nWhile typically, gamers chatting are playing together, GameChat does not require you to play the same games or even play a game at all in order to chat. In some ways, the feature almost acts as an advertisement. People can watch their friends play games they themselves don’t own, and then, if they’re in a Family Group, borrow them via the system’s newly announced virtual game cards.\n\n“There's layers to GameChat that I think are really exciting,” Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser tells WIRED.\n\nThe feature will reach its full potential in the hands of players, he added. “One of the things that for us is really important is that we watch and see how people engage in GameChat.”\n\nDoug Bowser, president of Nintendo of America, with the Nintendo Switch 2. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu\n\nBut online communities in gaming can be notoriously noxious. Any lobby or platform with open communication will, inevitably, become a vector for harassment and inappropriate imagery. Online games and platforms like Roblox, which are popular with young users, have massive problems with predators and pedophiles on the platform.\n\nGameChat activates voice chat with the system’s C button and allows for video use with a USB-C camera—features that could enable a great deal of abuse if left unchecked. During a roundtable discussion with Nintendo’s hardware team in New York City last week, Switch 2’s director Takuhiro Dohta and producer Kouichi Kawamoto talked about how they designed the system with safety considerations in mind. The feature is limited to a player’s friend list, and parents maintain a lot of control.\n\n“Parental controls for the minor who's gonna be using the chat can be set and controlled through the app,” Dohta tells WIRED. That means that only friends a parent has approved will be able to chat with players who are minors. Roblox has installed similar safety features as part of overhauled parental controls.\n\nAdult players, however, or players who do not have parental controls turned on, will need to be more proactive. “When it's just two adults, they also need to be friends with each other to be able to do a chat,” Dohta says, pointing to the console’s friend list systems. “You won't find yourself in a situation where you'll be placed in a chat with strangers.” Players will be able to import their friend lists from the Switch, though it may take some “fine tuning” to figure out who’s up for chatting, he said. “There's bound to be people who like chats, and there's people who don't prefer to chat.”\n\n“Ultimately, if something does happen or if someone is chatting with someone you don't want to chat with, there is also a report feature,” Kawamoto added.\n\nGameChat will launch with the Switch 2 on June 5 and will be included with Nintendo Switch Online membership.",

    "title": "Trump Is Willing to Take the Pain",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "Advisers say the president is tuning out the markets and coverage and isn’t worried about the political impact of his tariffs—at least not yet.\n\nDuring Donald Trump’s first term, advisers who wanted to check his most dramatic impulses reliably turned to two places to act as guardrails: the stock market and cable news. If the markets reacted badly to something Trump did, they found, he would likely change course to match Wall Street’s moves. And television’s hold over Trump was so great that, at times, his aides would look to get booked on a cable-news show, believing that the president would be more receptive to an idea he heard there than one floated during an Oval Office meeting.\n\nBut Trump’s second term looks different. Taking further steps today to escalate his global trade war, the president has ignored the deep plunges on Wall Street that have cost the economy trillions of dollars and accelerated risks of a bear market. He has tuned out the wall-to-wall coverage, at least on some cable networks, about the self-inflicted wounds he has dealt the United States economy. And unlike eight years ago, few members of Trump’s team are looking to rein him in, and those who think differently have almost all opted against publicly voicing disagreement.\n\nTrump is showing no signs—at least not yet—of being encumbered by political considerations as he makes the biggest bet of his presidency, according to three White House officials and two outside allies granted anonymity to discuss the president’s decision making. Emboldened by his historic comeback, he believes that launching a trade battle is his best chance of fundamentally remaking the American economy, elites and experts be damned.\n\n“This man was politically dead and survived both four criminal cases and an assassination attempt to be president again. He really believes in this and is going to go big,” one of the outside allies told me. “His pain threshold is high to get this done.”\n\nWhat’s not clear, even to some of those closest to him, is what will count as a victory.\n\nThe president has likened his tariffs to “medicine” for a sick patient, but they have caused widespread confusion—particularly over whether Trump is committed to keeping the plan in place for years to boost U.S. manufacturing or whether he is using the new tariffs as a negotiating ploy to force other countries to change their policies.\n\nRead: Trade will move on without the United States\n\n“We have many, many countries coming to negotiate deals with us, and they’re going to be fair deals,” Trump told reporters today in the Oval Office, adding that he will not pause the tariffs despite another day of Wall Street turbulence. “No other president’s going to do this, what I’m doing.”\n\nMarkets plunged around the globe today for the third-straight trading day after Trump announced the sweeping “Liberation Day” set of tariffs—imposed on nearly all of the world’s economies—that almost instantly remade the United States’ trading relationship with the rest of the world. He has said that Americans should expect short-term pain (“HANG TOUGH,” he declared on social media) as he attempts to make the U.S. economy less dependent on foreign-made goods.\n\nThe blowback has been extensive and relentless. Other nations have responded with retaliatory levies. Fears of a recession have spiked. CEOs, after panicking privately for days, are beginning to speak out. Most cable channels have been bathed in the red of graphs depicting plunging markets, the stock ticker in the corner falling ever downward. Even Fox News, which has downplayed the crisis, has begun carrying stories about the impact on Trump voters who are worried about shrinking retirement accounts and rising prices. GOP lawmakers, usually loath to cross the White House, are mulling trying to limit the president’s economic authority. Senator Ted Cruz worried that the tariffs will cause a 2026 midterms “bloodbath,” while seven other GOP senators, including Trump allies such as Chuck Grassley, signed on to a bipartisan bill that would require Congress to approve Trump’s steep tariffs on trading partners.\n\nTrump has stayed committed to the tariffs, and he lashed out today on social media at wavering Republicans, declaring them “Weak and Stupid” and warning, “Don’t be a PANICAN,” while his staff promised a veto of the bipartisan bill.\n\nYet even within Trump’s administration, the president’s moves have caused widespread confusion about what he is trying to get out of the tariffs. Peter Navarro, one of the administration’s most influential voices on trade, wrote in the Financial Times, “This is not a negotiation. For the US, it is a national emergency triggered by trade deficits caused by a rigged system.” Just a short time later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote on social media that he had been tasked by Trump to begin negotiations with Japan and that he looks “forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies.”\n\nThat public disconnect has brought private disagreements into the light, two of the White House officials and the other outside ally told me. Navarro and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller—who is perceived by many in Trump’s orbit as the most powerful aide on most issues—have embraced the idea that the tariffs should be permanent to erase trade deficits with other countries and even punish some nations, including China, for what the White House says are decades of unfair trade practices. Steve Bannon, the influential outside Trump adviser, has said on his podcast that bringing nations to the negotiating table is not enough and that the White House needs to insist that companies make commitments to bolster domestic manufacturing.\n\nBessent, a former hedge-fund manager who once worked for George Soros, has expressed some hesitancy behind closed doors about the tariffs, according to two of the White House officials. (The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) While stopping short of disagreeing with Trump, Bessent has tried in public interviews to soften the impact of the duties. Yesterday, he said on Meet the Press that “I see no reason that we have to price in a recession” and hinted that the tariffs could be temporary because a number of nations have already sought negotiations. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, who to this point has been Trump’s most visible adviser, today posted a well-known video of the economist Milton Friedman touting free trade. That followed a weekend during which Musk took aim at Navarro, suggesting that his push for steep trade barriers is too extreme.\n\nTrump himself hardly cleared up the inconsistent messaging when asked in the Oval Office this afternoon if the tariffs are a negotiating tool or are going to be permanent. “Well, they can both be true,” Trump said. “There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs.”\n\nEarlier in the day, the confused messaging had a material impact on the markets: A social-media post misconstruing a comment by National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett to suggest that Trump might pause the tariffs for 90 days briefly sent markets upward. The White House clarified that no change in policy was planned, prompting markets to go back down.\n\nThat brief rally also seemed to reveal Wall Street’s wishful thinking that the president will soon back off the tariffs—the same sense of optimism that mistakenly led investors to hope before last week that Trump’s campaign rhetoric about tariffs was just a bluff or a negotiating tactic. In a lengthy social-media post yesterday, the hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman, a staunch Trump supporter, wrote that the president needs to pause the tariffs or risk “a self-induced economic nuclear winter.”\n\nAnnie Lowrey: Here are the places where the recession has already begun\n\nMany Republicans had hoped that Trump’s economic policy would focus on extending his 2017 tax cuts (which disproportionately helped businesses and the wealthy) while also tackling inflation. But although Trump has long possessed a flexible ideology, one of his few consistent principles, dating to at least the 1980s, is a belief in tariffs, even though many economists believe that tariffs are outdated and ineffective in an era of globalization.\n\nTrump has done little to enact his campaign promise to bring down prices and has surprised some observers with his willingness to endanger his poll numbers by taking on such a risky tariff scheme. Although Trump is notorious for changing his mind on a whim, he is for now ignoring the complaints from business leaders and the warnings about the tariffs’ effect on his own voters.\n\nThere was another small marker recently of how Trump has changed from eight years ago. During his first administration, he regularly grew angry about any media coverage—particularly photographs—that portrayed him unflatteringly. Over the weekend, the front page of The Wall Street Journal carried a photo taken of Trump on Saturday, as he rode in the back of a vehicle wearing golf attire, waving, and talking on the phone, mouth open. The headline read: “Trump Heads to Golf Club Amid Tariff Turmoil.”\n\nYet Trump has not complained about the coverage, one of the White House officials told me. And he golfed again yesterday.",

    "title": "Take Trump Seriously About Greenland",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "The United States grabbing land from an ally sounds like the stuff of a Netflix political thriller. But every American should contemplate three realities about Donald Trump’s aggressive desire to acquire Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory. First, unlike his usual shtick, in which he floats wild ideas and then he and his aides alternate between saying he was serious and saying he might have been joking, he means it. The Danes seem to believe him, and so should Americans. When institutions begin planning based on the president’s directions, as the White House is now doing, it’s no longer idle talk.\n\nSecond, Trump is calling for actions that likely contravene American and international law. He is undermining the peace and stability of an allied nation, while threatening a campaign of territorial conquest. He refuses to rule out an unprovoked war of aggression, a violation of the United Nations Charter and an international crime that would be little different in kind from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attempt to seize Ukraine. Finally, the almost-certain illegality of any attempt to seize Greenland against the will of its people and the Danish government means that if Trump directs the U.S. military to engage in such an operation, he could well precipitate the greatest civil-military crisis in American history since the Civil War.\n\nHow do we know Trump is serious? “One way or another,” the president crowed in his speech to a Joint Session of Congress last month, “we’re gonna get it.” A few weeks later, in case anyone missed the point, Trump told NBC: “We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100 percent.” Trump says a lot of strange things, certainly. He has mused about striking hurricanes with nuclear weapons, running for a constitutionally prohibited third term, staying in office even if he loses, and annexing Canada as the 51st state. But when a president publicly makes a vow to Congress to do something and then repeats that vow over and over, such statements are not trial balloons; they are policy.\n\nAnd sure enough, Trump has followed up by sending Vice President J. D. Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, as unwelcome emissaries to Greenland. Vance—a neo-isolationist who apparently expresses opposition to the president’s plans only in Signal chats—has now embraced Trump’s old-school imperialism. Worse, Vance tried to press Trump’s case by boorishly criticizing Denmark’s relationship with the island, smarmily telling the Danes: “You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.” (Imagine the reaction in Washington if a European leader came, say, to Puerto Rico, castigated America’s management of the commonwealth, and urged the island to sever ties with the United States.) But at least he promised that military force, which to gain Greenland would have to be directed against Denmark, a NATO ally, was not going to be part of America’s efforts.\n\nTrump, true to form, short-sheeted his hapless VP the next day by saying that military force was not, in fact, “off the table.”\n\nOn Monday, The Washington Post reported that the White House has begun work on estimating the costs of controlling Greenland in “the most concrete effort yet to turn President Donald Trump’s desire to acquire the Danish territory into actionable policy.” Once these kinds of meetings start taking place in the White House, the next step is usually to send out orders to the rest of the American national-security establishment, including the CIA and the Pentagon, to begin planning for various contingencies.\n\nEven if the American people supported direct aggression against our own allies—by a large margin, they do not—public opinion is not a legitimate excuse for treaty-breaking. Treaties are the law of the land in the United States, and the president’s Article II powers as commander in chief do not allow him to wave a monarchical hand and violate those treaties at will. Just as Trump cannot legally issue orders to violate the Geneva Conventions or other agreements to which the United States is a signatory, he does not have the right to break America’s pact with NATO at will and effectively declare war against Denmark. When George W. Bush ordered U.S. forces into combat against Iraq in 2003, some of his critics claimed that his actions were illegal, but Bush at least had the fig leaf of a congressional resolution, as well as a lengthy list of UN Security Council resolutions. Trump will have literally nothing except his insistent greed and glory-seeking vanity.\n\nIf the U.S. military is given direct orders to seize Greenland—that is, if it is told to enter the territory of another nation, pull down that nation’s flag, and then claim the ground in the name of the United States—it will have been ordered to attack an ally and engage in a war of conquest, even if no shot is ever fired. These would be illegal orders, because they would violate not only our treaty obligations but also international prohibitions against unprovoked wars of aggression. At home, the president would be contravening the Constitution: Article II does not allow the commander in chief to run around the planet seizing territories he happens to want.\n\nAt that point, every senior commander, from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs on down, has a moral obligation to refuse to accept or support such a command. Pauline Shanks Kaurin, a military-ethics professor at the Naval War College (where I also taught for many years) told me, speaking in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the Defense Department, that civilian leaders have “the right to be wrong,” but that if the United States moves against Greenland, especially if both America and Denmark are part of NATO, “senior military leaders have an obligation to advise against this course of action and resign if necessary.” Shanks Kaurin added that this obligation might even extend to a requirement to refuse to draw up any plans.\n\nBut what if the orders are less obvious? Trump long ago mastered the Mafia-like talent of making his desires evident without actually telling others to engage in unsavory acts. In that case, he could issue instructions to the military aimed at intimidating Greenland that on their face are legal but that are obviously aggressive.\n\nRetired Major General Charles Dunlap, who served as the deputy judge advocate general of the U.S. Air Force and now teaches law at Duke, suggested that Trump could take advantage, for example, of the wide latitude given to the United States in its basing agreement with Greenland. The president, Dunlap told me in an email, could choose to engage in “a gross misreading of the agreement” and move a large number of troops to Greenland as “a show of force aimed at establishing a fait accompli of some kind.” Military officers are required to presume that commands from higher authority are legal orders, and so a series of directives aimed at swarming forces into Greenland would likely be obeyed, Dunlap said, “because of the potential ambiguity” of such directives “as well as the inference of lawfulness.”\n\nIn any case, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have taken important steps to ensure that no one is left in the Pentagon to tell them that their orders might be unlawful. All of the top military lawyers whose job is to provide independent legal advice on such matters have been fired. And, as Dunlap notes, courts are notoriously reluctant to get involved in such questions, which is why Congress must step in. “The military,” he said, “ought not be put in the middle of something like this.”\n\nAmericans used to take their presidents far more seriously. Before Trump, when a president spoke, his words instantly became the policy of the United States government—for better or worse. When President Ronald Reagan caught his own aides flat-footed by bungling a policy message during a press conference in 1983, for example, a Reagan-administration official later said: “You can’t say ‘No, he didn’t mean it’ or ‘That’s not really government policy.’ That’s out of the question.”\n\nBut those days are long gone. As a direct result of Trump’s many off-the-cuff ruminations and long stretches of political glossolalia, Trump has convinced many Americans not to take their president at his word until it’s too late. (Consider how many people, for example, refused to believe that he would impose massive global tariffs, a policy they can now examine more closely by the light of a burning stock market.)\n\nI realize that this entire discussion seems like utter lunacy. War against … Denmark? But when the president says something, it’s policy. Trump insists that he must be taken seriously. Americans and their elected representatives across the political spectrum should oblige him.",

    "title": "Wayne Gretzky, Former Canadian Hero",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "In the summer of 1988, when I was 14 years old, I went camping with my family not far outside Toronto. We emerged from the woods and I wandered over to a newspaper box by the side of the road. Through its cracked glass, I saw a front-page picture of Wayne Gretzky, weeping. He’d been traded from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings. I followed my idol’s lead and burst into tears.\n\nGretzky, back then at least, was more than a hockey player to Canadians. He was homegrown royalty, a player of such quality, of such rare possibility, that he transcended the game we’ve always used to define ourselves. I wasn’t even a true hockey kid, but I had Gretzky’s signature Titan stick, white with red lettering, and a pennant on my bedroom wall that memorialized his 1981–82 season, when he pocketed 92 goals and 120 assists for 212 points, all records. He went on to better that assists mark five times and reset his own points record with 215 in 1985–86. No one else has recorded more than 200 points in a season; he did four times, one for each Stanley Cup that he won. He retired in 1999 with 61 records, including the record for most records, and he still has more assists than anyone else has managed points. He changed hockey math, and with it our country’s measure of itself.\n\nToday Gretzky surrendered one of his most cherished records—the most goals in an NHL career—to Alex Ovechkin, a 39-year-old Russian who plays for the Washington Capitals. Ovechkin scored his 895th goal, one better than Gretzky’s 894, in the second period against the Islanders in New York. He belly flopped onto the ice in ecstasy and relief before he was mobbed by his teammates, and then the game stopped to celebrate the greatest goal scorer who ever lived.\n\nGretzky, 64 years old and red-faced, was there to witness the occasion, the way Gordie Howe had encouraged Gretzky’s pursuit of his career-goals record. For more than a century, Canadians had taken turns eclipsing one another, a chain of succession that began with Joe Malone and included Howie Morenz and Maurice Richard, until Ovechkin overtook them all, claiming what Spencer Carbery, the Canadian-born coach of the Capitals, called “the greatest record in our sport.”\n\nAfter Gretzky was traded to the Kings, his departure was cast as a mid-level national tragedy. “The biggest name in Canadian sports, the man hockey fans call the Great One, is going to the United States,” CBC anchor Knowlton Nash announced with a solemnity usually reserved for the deaths of princesses and declarations of war.\n\nNot long ago, Canadians might have regarded the loss of Gretzky’s record with similar distress. Today they’re reacting with ambivalence. Some percentage of Canadians, including recent waves of Ukrainian refugees, will feel uneasy about the record belonging to Ovechkin, a vocal supporter of Vladimir Putin. But for many, the record had already slipped away—if not in 1988 then in 2025, when Donald Trump became the U.S. president again and Gretzky was there to cheer him on too.\n\nTrump soon enraged Canadians with his “51st state” and “Governor Justin Trudeau” garbage, his trade war, and his open desire to annex our country. Anthem singers started getting earfuls at hockey games. Gretzky, who appears to have spent more time at Mar-a-Lago than in Canada lately, stayed a little too quiet about everything. When Canada and the U.S met in the final of the 4 Nations Face-Off in February, Gretzky was named our honorary captain and seemed reluctant to do it, without so much as a maple-leaf pin on his jacket lapel. After Canada won in overtime—I haven’t yelled at my TV like that in years—Gretzky gave the players red caps that said Be Great, a Trumpian echo that was either intentional or tone-deaf. He ended that debate on Friday night when he watched Ovechkin’s chase alongside Kash Patel, Trump’s FBI director. They sat together again this afternoon.\n\nBy then, Canadians were already calling Gretzky the “Great Once.” Someone smeared literal shit on his statue outside Edmonton’s Rogers Place; petitions were launched to rename the city’s Wayne Gretzky Drive and a parkway and arena in his hometown of Brantford, Ontario. Janet Gretzky, his American wife, came to his defense on Instagram: “I have never met anyone who is more Proud to be a Canadian, and it has broken his heart to read and see the mean comments,” she wrote. She deleted the post after other proud Canadians disputed her assessment.\n\nBack in 1988, many of us in Canada blamed her for Gretzky’s exit. They had married weeks before the trade, a few months after her star turn in Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach. Los Angeles must have been her idea, we assumed, a misogynist trope that survived even after it became obvious that Gretzky’s exile was self-imposed. We erected statues in his honor and named roads and arenas after him anyway. He went to St. Louis, to New York, to Phoenix, and somehow remained claimed by us. In 2009, we named him a Companion of the Order of Canada, our highest civilian honor, and ignored that he didn’t bother coming home to pick up his medal.\n\nNow it’s time for hard truths. Gretzky has lived in the U.S. longer than he lived up here, in an American mansion with an American wife and American kids, palling around on American golf courses with an American president who says that Canada “only works as a state.” It might break Gretzky’s heart to hear it, but a lot of Canadians don’t think of him as one of us anymore. Once, we cried over where he played his hockey. His face could have been on our money, never mind his name on our sticks. But he’s made clear his choice, and so we’ve made ours. Wayne Gretzky’s records, like his faults, are singular. The loss is his and his alone.",

    "title": "Trade Will Move On Without the United States",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "In his quest to make America great, President Donald Trump is withdrawing the United States from global trade. American families, companies, and investors will pay a price for this, as many commentators have noted. But the repercussions don’t end there. The tariff regime is also destroying a pillar of American global power, and it will further isolate the country at a moment when others stand ready to fill the vacuum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced that America would impose a 10 percent duty on imports from virtually all countries, plus additional punitive tariffs on countries he deems bad actors on trade, including Japan and members of the European Union. Some of these duties are extremely high. Adding the new levies to those previously imposed, China’s average tariff rate is now near 70 percent. Trump described the tariffs as payback: “Foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” he said. “Our country and its taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years, but it is not going to happen anymore.”\n\nTrump’s tariffs are the culmination of a decades-long shift in political perceptions in the United States, in which trade has gone from an unalloyed good to the source of all ills. The U.S. once sought to bring down barriers and open markets globally—forging trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and supporting the World Trade Organization. The resulting global trading system lowered the cost of goods, which benefited the companies and consumers of wealthy countries such as the United States. It also connected poorer countries, such as China, to international supply chains, allowing them to create jobs, woo investment, and alleviate poverty. The United States became, in effect, the world’s ultimate consumer, which tied other countries to its economy and its interests.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: Here are the places where the recession has already begun\n\nTrade was a glue that held the American-led international order together. But economics always involves trade-offs. As supply chains stretched across the globe in search of lower costs, many factories vanished from the American heartland. Some Americans fastened on trade as the source of the inequality and constrained mobility that plagued the country’s middle and working classes; populist politicians encouraged these sentiments.\n\nStrategically, too, trade’s promise seemed unrealized: Experts and politicians had assured Americans after the Cold War that economic exchange would transform China and Russia into peaceful partners. Within a couple of decades, these powers had clearly become authoritarian competitors instead.\n\nThe Trump team sold its tariffs program as a bid to set things straight by forcing America’s lost factories to return home. “You’re going to see the greatest resurgence of factory building and factory production in America,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in defense of the tariffs. Trump is “changing the way people think about production in America.”\n\nThe results are unlikely to be what the administration anticipates. Some foreign companies may indeed respond to the tariffs by building factories in the U.S. to maintain their presence in a crucial market. But many others are simply too small, or too integrated into existing supply chains, to make that move. Where the millions of American workers will come from to screw together iPhones or make car parts is also a mystery, especially given the president’s opposition to large-scale immigration. Factories in the U.S. are already struggling to find workers; the manufacturing sector has hundreds of thousands of vacant openings.\n\nTrump has long complained that some other countries tilt trade in their own favor. The White House, in explaining its tariff regime, cited practices by other countries, including currency manipulation and onerous product standards that inhibit imports, that have been real concerns. But the tariff regime may soon lay bare the inconvenient truth of comparative advantage: Certain goods are made outside the U.S. because factories elsewhere can produce them more cheaply and efficiently. Lower costs are a big factor, but so is competence. Many manufacturers in China and elsewhere have developed skills and expertise that make them highly competitive.\n\nThe likely outcome of Trump’s policy will be high prices for what Americans make and buy, whether produced at home at greater cost than abroad or imported from overseas with a punitive tax. By one estimate, tariffs could hike the price of a top-end iPhone to $2,300. The Trump team seems to accept this. “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in March. But when consumers buy fewer products at higher prices, companies produce and sell less and hire fewer workers, and growth slows. As French President Emmanuel Macron put it, Trump’s policy will make Americans “weaker and poorer.”\n\nAmericans will not be the only ones to suffer in a global trade war. Other countries will likely respond to U.S. tariffs by erecting protectionist barriers of their own. China has already announced an additional 34 percent tariff on U.S. imports. The EU is threatening to retaliate too. The global trade that was once an engine of prosperity may now reverse and become a source of economic competition.\n\nOther countries long accepted U.S. leadership because they saw Washington as a proponent of global economic progress. The role Trump is choosing for the United States is not that. He may eventually roll back tariffs for those countries that negotiate with him, and he may even see this as a show of kingpin-like strength: Trump has already said that he’d be willing to reduce duties on China in return for a deal involving TikTok. But the erratic and arbitrary nature of the policies, and the willingness to exploit U.S. economic might to extort concessions, will undermine American standing nearly everywhere.\n\nRogé Karma: Trump’s tariffs are designed to backfire\n\nIn fact, the administration’s tariff policy opens opportunities for Beijing, of all players, to portray itself as the more responsible global leader. In a meeting just days before Trump’s announcement, ministers from China, Japan, and South Korea issued a statement pledging to promote global trade.\n\nThat two of Washington’s closest allies would join Beijing in implicit criticism of the U.S. highlights the danger. The U.S. remains the world’s largest economy and a key market for many countries’ exports. But it is not the only game in town, either. A social-media account associated with CCTV, a Chinese state broadcaster, posted a graphic showing the extensive trade agreements that America’s partners have with one another and commented that, with the new tariffs, the U.S. is “shutting itself out of the world of free trade.” These countries will continue to expand their economic ties whatever Trump does. During his first term, after Trump withdrew the U.S. from a major trade agreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, participants completed the pact on their own.\n\nTariffs are not going to make other countries respect the United States. But they can make them move on without it.",

    "title": "The Missing Catharsis of That ‘White Lotus’ Finale",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "This article contains spoilers through the Season 3 finale of The White Lotus.\n\n\n\nOn The White Lotus, misdirection abounds. Each installment of the writer-director Mike White’s acerbic satire opens with a guest at the titular hotel chain stumbling upon a dead body, before rewinding a week to introduce a motley crew of patrons and staff who might each end up being the deceased. As these characters and their complicated relationships come into view, the question of the corpse’s identity recedes into the background; the fatal arc rarely plays out as anticipated, and is not always relevant to each character’s story.\n\nThe White Lotus, which began as a COVID-era limited series filmed in Hawaii, has always been a closely observed study of wealth and its excesses, whether carnal or material. This season, filmed mostly on the Thai island of Ko Samui, used the new setting to nudge its characters toward pursuits beyond the flesh. Guests got a crash course in Buddhist principles, a reflection of White’s own interest in the religion and its philosophies. The pacing was slower, and the tone less raucous, than in seasons past, as characters served up meditations on life, death, and the things we do to survive in between. But last night’s Season 3 finale proved that the show isn’t above an obvious, anticlimactic ending—and hasn’t quite transcended its original formula.\n\nPerhaps more than any other TV show airing now, The White Lotus has inspired fans to share their theories about the symbolism, pop-culture allusions, and real-world inspiration on view—and how that all might manifest in the finale’s on-screen deaths. In seven preceding episodes, Season 3 zoomed in on the insecurities, selfishness, and devious choices of a wide-ranging ensemble cast. Each narrative thread seemed to tease a potentially explosive ending, and the White Lotus team promised a shocking finale. The steady stream of online chatter helped propel this season to some of the show’s highest-ever ratings, but it also inadvertently revealed the trouble with this season’s writing. Instead of deepening the psychological and interpersonal inquiries of its character studies, The White Lotus simply bombarded viewers with more—more characters, more accents, more episodes, more dead bodies, more Easter eggs to scrutinize—only to end up with a predictable outcome.\n\n\n\nThe show has always been more invested in skewering its living hotel patrons than obsessing over the specifics of any one character’s demise. But the finale undermined—and wholly ignored—some of the season’s more interesting ideas. One of the season’s main stories has focused on Rick (played by Walton Goggins), a morose middle-aged man vacationing with his earnest, wide-eyed girlfriend, Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood). Rick spent most of the season chasing Jim (Scott Glenn), the man he believed to be his father’s killer, before confronting him in the penultimate episode. Rick managed to walk away from the encounter without harming Jim, and the resulting calm he felt afterward marked a notable shift for a man whose entire understanding of himself was shaped by the death of his father. It also represented a heartening development in his relationship with Chelsea, who had constantly begged Rick not to choose violence.\n\nRead: Reclaim imperfect faces\n\nNear the end of the finale, all of that progress was erased. A new encounter with Jim triggers Rick’s rage, leading to a wild shoot-out across the hotel grounds. And right after Rick does shoot Jim, he learns that Jim was actually his father—with no setup or follow-through. Just moments before, Chelsea had pleaded with Rick to “stop worrying about the love you didn’t get” and “think about the love you have.” Of course, Rick doesn’t, and his refusal leads to their deaths, too. The shootings played out in rapid succession, filling the final 20 minutes of the episode with a barrage of gunplay that felt like the rushed conclusion to an action film. Where the Season 2 finale imbued its important action scenes with a modicum of whimsy, last night’s episode presented little by way of humor, stylistic finesse, or emotional release. By the time Rick tells a dying Chelsea that they’ll be together forever, just like she’d said throughout the season, the words ring hollow.\n\n\n\nOther plotlines stacked up the possibility of immense tragedy, only to pull back at the last minute. Earlier in the season, embattled father Tim Ratliff (Jason Isaacs) had become desperately suicidal after learning he was under investigation for financial crimes. Convinced that his family would not survive the loss of their wealth, he seemed prepared to poison not only himself but also his wife and two of his children. For a short stretch in the last episode, it seemed like his younger son, Lochlan (Sam Nivola), would inadvertently die instead. But after accidentally drinking a poisoned milkshake, Lochlan was … fine, and his family soon boarded a boat departing the island (with no acknowledgment of the shoot-out that had just killed multiple people). For a moment, Tim seems ready to tell his wife and children what will happen when they get back to the United States—but then the scene ends. After eight episodes of the show hinting at a possible murder-suicide, the finale sends them off with nothing worse than a stomachache.\n\nAnother scene struck a very different note, in a marked contrast to the plot-heavy proceedings. Throughout the season, a trio of childhood friends—Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), Kate (Leslie Bibb), and Laurie (Carrie Coon)—had navigated their middle-age ennui by gossiping about one another. Then, in a lovely monologue, Laurie admitted that their bond was one of the most important things in her life. “I don’t need religion or God to give my life meaning, because time gives it meaning,” she says tearfully. “We started this life together. I mean, we’re going through it apart, but we’re still together.” It’s a beautiful sentiment, bringing some welcome closure to a true-to-life dynamic. But sandwiched in between so much plot, the scene’s gravity was undercut. If the finale had stopped trying to do so much, perhaps it could have actually given us some emotional satisfaction.",

    "content": "Last month, Nicholas Gilbert received a delivery of grain for the 1,400 cows he tends at his dairy farm in Potsdam, New York, 20 miles from the Ontario border. The feed came with a surprise tariff of $2,200 tacked on. “We have small margins,” he told me. “I had a contracted price on that grain delivered to my barn. It was supposed to be so much per ton. And they added that tariff right on top because it comes from a Canadian feed mill.”\n\nGilbert cannot increase the price of the milk he sells, which is set by the local co-op. He cannot feed his cows less food. He cannot buy feed from another supplier; there aren’t any nearby, and getting it from farther away would be more expensive. When he got the delivery, he stared at the tariff for a while. Shouldn’t his Canadian supplier have been responsible for paying it? “I’m not even sure it’s legal! We contracted for the price on delivery! If your price of fuel goes up or your truck breaks down, that’s not my problem! That’s what the contract’s for.”\n\nBut the tariff was legal, and it was Gilbert’s responsibility. The dairy farmer is one of tens of thousands of American business owners caught in a spiraling trade war, and lives in one area of the United States that might already be tipping into a recession because of it. Businesses near the Canadian border are particularly vulnerable to the rising costs and falling revenue caused by tariffs, and are delaying projects, holding off on hiring, raising prices, letting workers go, or wondering how they are going to keep feeding their cows as a result.\n\nPresident Donald Trump kicked off his long-promised trade war by applying levies to steel, aluminum, and goods from China, Canada, and Mexico soon after he took office—insisting, incorrectly, that foreign companies would pay the tariffs and that American growth would surge. On Wednesday, he unleashed a global shock-and-awe campaign, announcing tariffs on every American trading partner.\n\nRogé Karma: Trump’s most inexplicable decision yet\n\nThe measures are meant to counter foreign countries’ tariffs and trade barriers, Trump said. But the numbers announced have nothing to do with such policies, where they even exist. The White House set a minimum 10 percent levy on imports from around the world, and imposed higher rates on imports from more than 60 countries, territories, and trading blocs. The administration appears to have derived those higher rates by dividing the value of the country’s bilateral trade deficit with the United States by the value of its exports to the United States.\n\nThe tariffs are capricious, haphazard, and weird. The Trump administration took into account only trade in goods, not services. It slapped tariffs on countries with long-standing free-trade agreements with Washington, including Australia, South Korea, Israel, Panama, Singapore, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. It put tariffs on countries with a trade surplus with the United States. It implemented tariffs on remote, uninhabited islands. It implemented tariffs on a territory occupied predominantly by American and British soldiers.\n\nThe nonsensical policy will nevertheless have real effects. American consumer goods will get more expensive, with the average family paying an estimated $3,800 more a year for groceries, cars, clothing, furniture, and everything else if the tariff rates remain this high. Thousands of American firms, mostly small businesses, will go under. The United States risks collapsing into an astonishing voluntary recession, caused solely by a few powerful ideologues’ erroneous beliefs about trade.\n\nIf you want to understand where the American economy is heading, head to the border.\n\nFrom Bellingham, Washington, to Calais, Maine, the United States has dozens of communities that are not so much linked to Canada’s economy as interwoven with it. Gas stations in these places rely on business from Canadian commuters. Ski resorts and water parks rely on Canadian tourists. Manufacturing firms rely on Canadian industrial inputs. Farms rely on Canadian feed. Hotels rely on Canadian business conferences.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: Don’t invite a recession in\n\nContrary to Trump’s pronouncements, tariffs are paid by domestic importers, not foreign exporters. Most companies pass the cost increase on to consumers. Others, like Adon Farms, cannot. “We’re taking that right on the chin,” Gilbert told me, explaining that he would have to pay tariffs on the fertilizer and farm equipment he buys too. “We’re not like other businesses,” he told me. “We’re very slow moving. I can’t pivot at all.”\n\nManufacturing firms and construction companies near the border face the same quandaries as the costs of steel, aluminum, lumber, and machine parts rise. These firms can’t quickly relocate their operations or find new suppliers either. “We surveyed 40 of our manufacturing companies in the region,” Garry Douglas, of New York’s North Country Chamber of Commerce, told me. “One sources raw materials from Canada and is looking at a $16 million cost increase to their U.S. operation. Another company is a paper mill that sources wood pulp from Canada. It’s the one source of the type of wood they need.”\n\nAt the same time as it is raising costs for border businesses, Trump’s quixotic trade war with Canada is depressing revenue for these businesses too. Dan Kelleher runs a tourism-promotion agency in the Adirondacks. “We had a terrific January in terms of overall visitation,” he told me. “Our numbers were up 24 percent over the five-year average. And then February came.” The president kept referring to Canada as the “51st state,” and hit the United States’ closest ally with a 25 percent tariff. Spending on lodging dropped 4 percent in February, Kelleher told me, with retailers reporting a 20 percent decline in sales.\n\n“We have a lot of cross-border events, particularly hockey tournaments,” Kelleher said. “The teams are locked in to come play, but when they come, they’re not spending any money here.” He worried about the summer tourist season, and more so about the relationship between residents of the Adirondacks and their neighbors across the border. “Our Canadian friends—they’re upset, they’re hurt, they’re betrayed.”\n\nRon Kurnik is a dual citizen who lives in Canada and commutes across the border to run Superior Coffee Roasting, a café and coffee distributor in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. “One of our premier labels is an espresso blend, which I aptly termed the friendly neighbors,” he told me. “We spell it both ways on the label, neighbors and neighbours. It’s been the centerpiece of our business, and our relationship with the residents of this area.”\n\nRogé Karma: Trump’s tariffs are designed to backfire\n\nKurnik imports his coffee beans from Mexico and his coffee bags from China; both are more expensive, thanks to Trump’s levies. “With the added tax, we’re currently underwater on distribution,” he told me. With fewer Canadians crossing the Saint Marys River, sales at his café have dropped too. Superior Coffee Roasting has a “bit of a war chest,” in the form of profits from last year, Kurnik said. “That will probably, probably, get us through this year.” But he’s cut back on employee hours and laid one person off. “I’m trying to hold the line and not make too many big, consequential decisions,” he said. “If these things continue for six, eight months or beyond, it’s going to get bad.”\n\nResidents of border towns see their shopping malls and greasy spoons half empty. They read stories in the local paper about rising construction costs and Canadians detained at border crossings. They notice the lack of hiring signs. They hear about the trade war on the evening news. As a result, many are reducing their own spending in expectation of a downturn: putting off home repairs, delaying the purchase of a new car, canceling vacations, eating in instead of ordering out.\n\n“It is definitely having a rippling effect, and it’s been immediate,” says Michael Cashman, the supervisor of the town of Plattsburgh, New York, 20 minutes south of the border. “These may seem like small trade restrictions in Washington. But they’re devastating for our region.” He told me he was “deeply concerned” about sales-tax revenue dropping. Plattsburgh is preparing to pull back on public spending “until there is more clarity in the forecast.” Of course, the town cutting its budget would worsen the downturn.\n\nWhat is happening in Plattsburgh and Sault Ste. Marie is happening in rural Nebraska, Kentucky’s bourbon country, and Las Vegas too—in every community that relies on foreign tourists, foreign imports, foreign exports, and cross-border traffic. Now, Trump’s new policies have put the whole country at risk. I surveyed my inbox the morning after the president’s Liberation Day announcement, reading market analysts’ notes: a “self-inflicted economic catastrophe,” a “large headwind,” a “transformed outlook,” “unconditionally bad,” an “extended period of volatility,” a “historic shift,” “madness.”\n\nIn Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, Kurnik was penciling out numbers on Wednesday—when retailers might raise prices for a bag of beans, how much to slow down production—while Trump was preparing for his speech in the Rose Garden. “We can’t operate a business flying by the seat of our pants,” he told me. “The administration can organize itself in that fashion. But how do you realistically expect me to follow suit?”",

    "title": "What Makes Modern Measles Outbreaks Different",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "Updated at 12 p.m. on April 7, 2025\n\nThe current U.S. measles outbreak follows, in some ways, a classic pattern: The virus first found a foothold where childhood vaccination is low—among Mennonites in Texas, in this case—before rapidly spreading to other communities and states. It has sickened mostly children and has now killed a second child, whose death was reported this weekend. With cases still ticking up, experts expect the outbreak to persist for a year.\n\nLook closely at the outbreak’s edges, though, and the patterns are more unusual: It’s not just children getting measles. Where Texas’s outbreak has spilled over into New Mexico, for example, half of the confirmed cases and one potential death involve adults, largely unvaccinated. Last year, too, adults older than 20 accounted for more than a quarter of U.S. measles cases. This is all in keeping with what experts have warn ed : Adults are now susceptible to this childhood disease.\n\nDoctors tend to be unfamiliar with adult measles, because adults used to not get it. In the prevaccine era, the extremely contagious virus blazed through with such frequency that virtually all children were infected with measles before reaching adulthood. Today, vaccine coverage is widespread enough that unvaccinated children can easily live to adulthood without ever encountering the virus, but not uniformly high enough to prevent outbreaks altogether. Vaccinated adults can get occasional breakthrough cases, but the illness tends to be much milder. Unvaccinated adults, however, are a uniquely vulnerable group, because measles only becomes nastier and deadlier with age.\n\nThe risk from measles follows a U-shaped curve, Neal Halsey, a measles expert and professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins, told me. On the left are children under 5, whose still-maturing immune systems might struggle to fend off the virus. On the right are adults; the rise in mortality gets steeper and steeper over time, eventually surpassing the mortality in young children. When measles managed to reach isolated villages in the past—such as when a sick sailor brought it to a remote part of Greenland in 1951—outbreaks on “virgin soil” proved especially deadly for adults. Of the 77 people who died in Greenland then, 59 were over the age of 35. Measles may be a classic childhood illness, but it mostly killed adults there.\n\nThis age gradient of measles severity persists today. Although the typical symptoms of rash, fever, and cough are the same, adults—even healthy adults in their 20s and 30s—grow more prone to the severe complications that might prove dangerous and even fatal. Pneumonia and encephalitis, or infections of the lungs and brain respectively, are more common. One in four adults with measles will need to be hospitalized, a rate that is roughly two to three times that of school-age children.\n\nMatthew Goetz still has “vivid memories” of adult patients he treated as an infectious-disease doctor during a 1988–90 outbreak in Los Angeles. The first patient wasn’t diagnosed until after a couple of days in the hospital, he recalls, because doctors had little reason to suspect that an adult would have measles. Several more soon showed up. Of the 33 patients eventually admitted to the public hospital where Goetz worked, nine had to be transferred to the ICU. Six developed respiratory failure so severe that they needed a ventilator.\n\nWhen measles returned to Southern California with the Disneyland outbreak of 2014–15, adults made up more than half of those cases. The two sickest patients of the outbreak, who both needed to be ventilated for pneumonia, were also adults, Kathleen Harriman, an epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health, told me.\n\nWhy measles gets deadlier with age of first contact is still not entirely understood; the adult immune system must somehow be less optimized to fight off the virus. Halsey points out that this pattern is not unique to measles: Chicken pox and hepatitis A are also milder in children than in adults. So is COVID, as we’ve recently seen.\n\nThe consequences of measles can linger long after infection too. Measles has a singular ability to induce “immune amnesia,” making survivors potentially susceptible to other diseases they’ve already had or been vaccinated against. This is because the virus attacks immune cells, including memory B cells, which “remember” how to fight known pathogens through antibodies. A 2019 study found that a course of measles infection in unvaccinated children wrecked 11 to 73 percent of their antibody repertoire. This range suggests that immune amnesia’s impact may vary widely from person to person, but the overall trend explains some old and odd observations about postmeasles immune suppression. For example, measles can make autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks one’s own body, go into remission. Immune amnesia also explains, at least in part, a long-standing pattern of children becoming more vulnerable to other illnesses after getting measles.\n\nThis effect has largely been studied in children, so scientists do not really know how it affects adults. “I would anticipate that it would be very similar—and it also might even be slightly worse,” says Stephen Elledge, a biologist at Harvard and senior author on the 2019 immune-amnesia study. A course of measles tends to last longer and be more severe in adults, he reasons, so the disease may kill off more of their memory cells. He suggests that anyone who gets measles should get revaccinated for other diseases, just in case.\n\nIf the measles vaccination rate dips further, adult cases could become even more common. The U.S. eliminated measles in 2000, after many years of achieving a better than 95 percent vaccination rate among kindergartners. This number started slipping in 2020 and is now down to 92.7 percent, which is, importantly, edging toward the measles herd-immunity threshold of 92 to 94 percent. Under this threshold, herd immunity can no longer limit spread enough to protect the unvaccinated. A bigger pool of unvaccinated kindergartners means a greater potential for outbreaks that grow massive enough to threaten unvaccinated adults. And if those unvaccinated kids never get their shots later in life, they will become susceptible adults, growing more vulnerable to measles with age.\n\nFor now, the Texas outbreak is already so widespread that the U.S. is likely to lose its measles-elimination status. In the time it will take to get this outbreak under control, more children will certainly get infected, as will more adults.",

    "content": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nWelcome back to The Daily’s Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what’s keeping them entertained. Today’s special guest is Annie Joy Williams, an assistant editor who has written about the end of Hooters and the Republican leaders who once thought January 6 was “tragic.”\n\nAnnie Joy enjoys listening to Michael Martin Murphey with her father, recommends watching Vengeance for some proper honey-butter-chicken-biscuit appreciation, and is a proud Alex Cooper apologist.\n\nBut first, here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:\n\nThe Culture Survey: Annie Joy Williams\n\nA musical artist who means a lot to me: Michael Martin Murphey. I have to thank my father for introducing me to him. My father was a pilot, so he was constantly traveling when I was growing up outside of Nashville. When he was in town, it was a special treat for me and my sisters to get picked up in his GMC truck, which was equipped with crank windows and decorated with enough bumper stickers to cause some serious fights with my mom.\n\nThere was always a Michael Martin Murphey tape in the cassette player. His song “Wildfire” brought my dad to tears. My personal favorites were “Vanishing Breed” and “Children of the Wild World.” When he played “Pilgrims on the Way,” my dad would slap his Wrangler jeans in time with the lyric “The cowboy slaps the dust away.” Some combination of hay, dirt, and dust would fly into the air (he moonlighted as a farmer), and I thought it was hilarious. He and I went on a trip to Montana this past winter, and Murphey was once again our soundtrack, for the first time in about 15 years. We both cried as we looked out the window.\n\nMy favorite movies: La La Land, Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, and (500) Days of Summer are all top films for me. A less widely known film that I just adore is B. J. Novak’s Vengeance. I find that many films about the South are offensive to those of us who hail from there. And I get it, it’s easy to make southerners the butt of the joke—we really tee it up for people sometimes. Rarely do I find a film that adequately captures both the good and the bad of a place so storied and complex. Novak spent substantial time in West Texas before filming to better understand its people. “I want this to be Texans’ favorite movie,” he told Texas Monthly.\n\nThe film is hilarious. I saw it in D.C. with a group of friends I once lived with in Texas, and we kept saying how its portrayal of the North-South disconnect is spot-on. Plus, it pays proper homage to the honey-butter chicken biscuit, which I appreciate. [Related: The podcast spreading the love of cowboy culture]\n\nThe last museum or gallery show that I loved: The Alvin Ailey exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art, in New York City. As a dance teacher, I’ve always admired the contributions Ailey made to modern dance. He was a gay Black man from rural Texas who used choreography as a form of protest during the civil-rights movement. He eventually became a household name in New York, showcasing routines inspired by the river baptisms and gospel music of his Texas childhood. My favorite part of the exhibit was the collection of notes he wrote to himself, a mix of manifestos and eight-count choreography. I visited the exhibit with my mother, who sacrificed a lot to put me through dance classes and endless competitions, so experiencing that together was sweet.\n\nA quiet song that I love, and a loud song that I love: I’m more of a quiet-song person myself, so I’ll give you three: “Boyhood,” by the Japanese House; “Bathroom Light,” by Mt. Joy; and “Into the Mystic,” by Van Morrison.\n\nA loud song that I love is “Love It if We Made It,” by the 1975. Also, “Yoü and I,” by Lady Gaga. Makes me wish I was from Nebraska.\n\nA cultural product I loved as a teenager and still love, and something I loved but now dislike: It wasn’t so much a cultural product as it was a cultural moment, but I’d like to think I grew up in the era of peak Disney Channel. My sisters are firmly Millennials, so I got to bear witness to the greats of their generation, such as Lizzie McGuire and Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, as well as those of my generation—Hannah Montana, The Cheetah Girls, and, perhaps most notably, Disney Channel Games. I might have been too cool to love this stuff by my teenage years, but I’ve recently returned to these classics. My best friend and I discovered a Disney Channel Original Hits dance class at a studio in Brooklyn. We’ve gotten really close with the instructor, and it’s quickly become the highlight of our week. Now, the concealer lips, ultra-thin eyebrows, and extreme side parts from that era? We can leave those in 2005. [Related: What tween TV teaches kids]\n\nA favorite story I’ve read in The Atlantic: “Jenisha From Kentucky,” by Jenisha Watts, and “The Day I Got Old,” by Caitlin Flanagan.\n\nAn online creator whom I’m a fan of: Look, say what you will, but Alex Cooper is a mastermind. I used to be a skeptic. The first time I listened to Call Her Daddy, I was stunned. It was 2019, and she was still tag-teaming the podcast with Sofia Franklyn. The episode was truly one of the most vulgar things I’d ever heard. Now I know she was scheming from the start. Cooper grabbed the world’s attention through her sex-forward crassness, and right when the public was ready to cast her out as a buxom blonde with little more to her than sex tricks and a pretty face, she showed her smarts. In the new, sans-Franklyn version of her show, she often gets rare sit-downs with pop-culture phenomenons, political candidates, and renowned actors. And they actually share revealing things with her because they’re thinking: This girl was just detailing her sex life in front of the whole world—she can’t judge me. Her unconventional openness invites openness from anyone sitting across from her. Not every interview is groundbreaking, but at least she’s getting every interview. Is her approach my style? Maybe not, but I’m a proud Alex Cooper apologist.\n\nA poem that I return to: I’d like to think that I’m above bias here, but my sister is a poet, and I have spent my life trying to be half the writer she is. I always come back to this one poem she wrote about our experience as girls in church. Now we watch our nieces grow up and discover God.\n\nGod was not a girl. The earth he made\n\nwith apples seeds, the heavens with half-priced glitter.\n\nWe danced, and God smiled.\n\nDrop the crayon,\n\ntake a tampon.\n\nSundays are for silver crosses\n\nand I’m sorry, prayer groups circling\n\nrumors. God is purity vow and camp deposit.\n\nGod is a one-piece swimsuit.\n\nGod is not a girl. Our hips he made\n\nwith hunger, our tongues with minty silence.\n\nWe kneel, and God tells us to smile.\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\nWarfare, a film based on the co-director Ray Mendoza’s experiences during the Iraq War (in theaters Friday) Season 7 of Black Mirror, a satirical sci-fi series (premieres Thursday on Netflix) Authority, an essay collection by the Pulitzer Prize–winning critic Andrea Long Chu (out Tuesday)\n\nEssay\n\nIllustration by The Atlantic.

The show’s producer asked the staff to keep an eye on their email over the weekend in case they needed to cover a breaking news event. No one seemed to mind—working full days in person while remaining on call in the evening and on weekends has always been a standard practice in the news business—but Heaton had a simple request. He said he would be happy to go in but asked if his boss could call him on the phone instead of emailing him. He didn’t want to spend his time off continually monitoring his inbox for a message that might not even come … Heaton was onto something.\n\nRead the full article.\n\nMore in Culture\n\nCatch Up on The Atlantic\n\nPhoto Album\n\nFollowers of the Layene Sufi Order, dressed in white, gather to perform the Eid al-Fitr prayer at the tomb of Seydina Limamou Lahi, the founder of the Layene Order.

    "title": "America Has Gotten Coretta Scott King Wrong",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "A year after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, the publishing company Holt, Rinehart and Winston released Coretta Scott King’s My Life With Martin Luther King, Jr. A senior editor at HRW, Charlotte Mayerson, a white woman, had contracted the writer Alden Hatch, also white, for the sizable sum of $15,000 to ghostwrite the book, based on interviews Mayerson had recently completed with Scott King. All of this was “totally confidential,” as the agreement between Hatch and the publisher spelled out, and the book, like the memoirs of many famous people then and now, was presented simply as her autobiography.\n\nI had learned about Hatch in the process of researching Coretta Scott and Martin Luther King Jr.’s life and political partnership for my own book, King of the North: Martin Luther King Jr.’s Life of Struggle Outside the South, and was excited to find that some of the transcripts and audio recordings of those interviews had survived in papers Hatch had donated to the University of Florida. As I listened to one of the recordings, something started to bother me. Scott King didn’t sound the way she did in My Life With Martin Luther King, Jr. The surviving transcripts of the interviews were a chaotic, incomplete mess—but even so, they were quite revealing: The details of Scott King’s ideas were different and more substantive, her perspectives fiercer and more contemplative, than what was portrayed in the book.\n\nAnd then I found something that explained why—a folder that contained letters between Hatch and Mayerson. When Mayerson sent Hatch the interviews for him to begin ghostwriting the autobiography, she explicitly instructed Hatch that although Scott King talked a “vast amount” about herself and her family background, “it is urgent that the focus of the book be on Martin, not on Coretta.” Despite choosing a white male ghostwriter who did not know Scott King, Mayerson wanted a “very female, personal, and sentimental story” in a “tone that is more like the Reader’s Digest.” Mayerson’s racial blinders shone through—telling Hatch that Scott King had a “certain cold bloodedness in her attitude toward whites.” When Mayerson questioned her about the death of Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, two white Freedom Summer volunteers killed in Mississippi in 1964, she said she was “sad that they died,” but “felt that it was an important event because it made the white community more aware of the problems than any number of Negro deaths would have done.” As I listened to the few recordings and read through the surviving interview transcripts, I noticed how Mayerson interrupted Scott King frequently during the interviews, her incredulity at some of Scott King’s answers coming through clearly.\n\nMonths later, as Hatch started to show Scott King draft chapters of the book, both Coretta and her older sister Edythe raised objections to the book’s tone and lack of attention to their family’s work. Hatch was dismissive, telling Mayerson, “I deliberately wrote it with very simple language that I believe would have a special appeal for the critics.” He instructed Mayerson to call in the “big reserves” to intimidate Coretta to acquiesce.\n\n“I am made to sound like an attachment to a vacuum cleaner,” Scott King had observed about the ways she was often represented in public discourse: “the wife of Martin, then the widow of Martin, all of which I was proud to be.” This had even been true in her own “autobiography.” “I didn’t learn my commitment from Martin, we just converged at a certain time.” Although a number of biographers since then have taken note of her politics before she met Martin, she largely disappears as a political actor throughout his life and leadership, until she moves to carry on his legacy after the assassination.\n\nScott King saw the deficit partly as a result of who was doing the telling. At one of the first conferences of King scholars, in 1986, she said to those gathered, “The next time we have a conference on him, I want to see more women scholars. He allowed me to be myself, and that meant that I always expressed my views.”\n\nTheirs was a political and intellectual partnership from the beginning. King married a feminist intellectual freedom fighter with unflinching determination, and he could not have been the leader he was without her. Scott King’s activism—her understanding of the evils of racism, poverty, and militarism—started before her marriage, complemented and influenced her husband’s work, and extended well beyond his assassination, in 1968. She was the family leader on issues of peace, war, and the economy. Although their relationship hewed to certain gender conventions of the time, particularly because of King’s belief that she be the one to stay home and raise the children, it challenged other dominant social mores. Both refused to “stay in their lane” despite immense pressure; they prioritized a life of struggle over a safe or materially secure family life, she spoke her mind both privately and publicly, and he relied on her thoughts and on her unwavering commitment to keep going.\n\nCoretta was more politically active than Martin when they met. She had grown up in a proud farming family in Alabama who owned their own land. The family was harassed and threatened repeatedly. When her father started transporting lumber, a business reserved for white people, whites torched their house to the ground. And when her father refused to sell his business to a white man, whites burned the business too. Those experiences and the pride that her parents instilled in her helped prepare Coretta for what she would encounter as an adult. Growing up, “I was tough,” and liked to fight, she told Mayerson in 1968—something that didn’t make it into the book.\n\nHer mother was determined that her daughters would get a good education, and sent them to the Lincoln Normal School, in Marion, Alabama. Coretta and Edythe then became the first Black students in decades to attend Antioch College, in Ohio. Coretta majored in music and education and got involved in numerous civil-rights and anti–Cold War efforts. She was introduced to the Progressive Party, which was created to challenge both the Democrats and Republicans on U.S. segregation and Cold War militarism. In 1948, she supported Henry Wallace for president, and attended the Progressive Party Convention in Philadelphia as a student delegate (one of about 150 African Americans at the convention). Through her Progressive Party activities, she met both the singer Paul Robeson and the activist Bayard Rustin, and heard the playwright and activist Shirley Graham (who would marry W. E. B. Du Bois three years later) give a powerful speech.\n\nSeeking to pursue a music career, Coretta moved to Boston to attend the New England Conservatory of Music. There, through a friend, she met Martin, who was getting his doctorate at Boston University, in January 1952. They talked about racism and capitalism on their first date. Martin was smitten; he’d never met a woman like her. At the end of that date, he told her she had “all the qualities he wanted in a wife—beauty, personality, character, and intelligence.” She was incredulous, telling him, “You don’t even know me.” But she agreed to another date. She was impressed with his vision and determination to change the country. And Martin was a good listener; he didn’t judge. Their romance blossomed. Still, she worried that becoming a minister’s wife would make her life small. It took her many months to decide whether to marry him. When they did wed, in June 1953, she refused to wear white and made her imposing father-in-law take “obey” out of their vows, because it made her feel “like an indentured servant.” She would keep Scott as her middle name, which she then always used, becoming Coretta Scott King for the rest of her life, unlike many women of her generation. Many journalists and public officials would refuse to recognize that, referring to her only as “Mrs. Martin Luther King.”\n\nBettmann Archive / Getty\n\nCoretta’s steadfastness came out early. Seven weeks into the Montgomery bus boycott, on January 30, 1956, the Kings’ home was bombed. Both Coretta and their two-month-old baby, Yolanda, were home. Hearing a thump, she moved fast, succeeding in getting them out unscathed. Furious and terrified by the news, both Martin’s and Coretta’s fathers came to Montgomery to tell them to leave immediately—or, at the very least, to get Coretta and Yolanda out of there. The pressure was immense. “I knew I wasn’t going anywhere,” Coretta recalled in a 1966 interview with New Lady magazine. The next morning at breakfast, Martin was grateful: “You were the only one who stood with me.” Had she flinched in that moment, as I wrote for this magazine in 2018, the trajectory of the bus boycott and Martin’s emerging leadership could have been very different.\n\nFrom that night on, they lived with the understanding that if they continued in the struggle, she too might be killed. Martin had to reckon with the possibility of Coretta’s death, just as she had to reckon with his. When he grew frightened, she would remind him that the movement was bigger than they were. In key ways, the Kings were forging a way of family life and leadership different from that of many of their generation and their parents, by rejecting the “promise of protection” that good men were supposed to provide and prioritizing a life of freedom fighting instead.\n\nMartin came to rely on Coretta’s unflinching steeliness. The one time she broke down terrified him. In 1960, King was arrested at an Atlanta sit-in; when the others were released, the state dredged up an old traffic charge to keep him, transferring him hundreds of miles in the middle of the night, his hands shackled to the police-car floor. He thought he was going to be killed. Then, when the judge sentenced him to four months’ hard labor, Coretta, frightened, exhausted, and six months pregnant, started crying. Martin was shaken: “Corrie, I’ve never seen you like this; you have to stand up for me.” In many ways, he relied on her strength.\n\nIn her own activism, Scott King came to zero in on global peace and anti-colonialism. In 1962, when their third son, Dexter, was not even 2 years old, she joined a Women Strike for Peace delegation for a multination disarmament conference in Geneva, Switzerland, to pressure the United States and the Soviet Union to sign a nuclear-test-ban treaty. As Scott King told the press, “The rights that we had achieved were meaningless unless there was a world to exercise those rights.” The punishing climate of the Cold War—in which people were slandered for their political beliefs, called “un-American,” and in some cases even fired from their job—led many people, both Black and white, including many activists the Kings knew, to stay away from such global politics. But Scott King pushed forward, the Geneva trip deepening her global commitments. In 1963, she led a march to the United Nations carrying a sign saying Let’s Make Our Earth a Nuclear-Free Zone, where a delegation met with UN Secretary-General U Thant. Scott King then left New York City for another Women Strike for Peace action in Washington, D.C., telling the press she was proud to be identified with the peace movement. “I can never be free until every black man from Johannesburg, South Africa, to Jackson, Mississippi, is free.”\n\nAfter King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, she saw a heightened responsibility for both of them to the global community, as My Life With Martin Luther King, Jr. notes. She spoke out against U.S. involvement in Vietnam and became “the family spokesperson on the peace issues,” though the book gives this part of her life very scant treatment. One reporter pushed King on how he had found such a political companion; had he trained her in this direction? King laughed and then responded, “It may have been the other way around. When I met her, she was very concerned with all the things we are trying to do now … I wish I could say to satisfy my masculine ego that I led her down this path but I must say we went down together.”\n\nScott King tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1965 to take a stand on Vietnam. At an SCLC retreat in early 1965, she explained how the war drains “resources from education, housing, health, and other badly needed programs,” making clear to those gathered, “why do you think we got the Nobel Prize? … Peace and justice are indivisible.” She understood that they had gotten the award, and thus the responsibilities demanded of them around racism, poverty, and militarism.\n\nTo be a peace activist in 1965 was to be seen as un-American, but Scott King was “beyond steel,” as a fellow activist noted. In May 1965, bucking Cold War pressure, she addressed the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom conference on the topic of “Peace, Jobs, and Freedom,” and then in June she spoke before a crowd of 18,000 at the Emergency Rally on Vietnam, in Madison Square Garden. For this work, in March 1966, the FBI put her in a category of “subversives.”\n\nIn September 1965, after a meeting at the UN, King denounced the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam. President Lyndon B. Johnson was furious. Congressmen questioned King’s patriotism, and newspapers editorialized against him. Feeling the pressure, in November, he backed out of an address to a D.C. peace rally, but Scott King kept her commitment and spoke. Addressing the 25,000 gathered, she underlined that “unless America learns to respect the right to freedom and justice for all, then the very things which we hold dear in this country will wither away in the hypocritical ritual of the preservation of national self-interest.” Following her appearance, a reporter asked King if he had educated his wife on these issues. “She educated me,” he replied. In fall 1966, Scott King joined the steering committee of what became the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam. She was leading not just her husband on this issue, but the nation. King would make his historic anti-war speech from Riverside Church on April 4, 1967.\n\nIn the last six months of his life, King turned to building the Poor People’s Campaign. Although many in the SCLC balked, Scott King was already on board. The idea for the PPC was that a multiracial army of people from across the nation, drawing from local groups across the country, would descend on D.C. and stay there to force Congress to “see the poor” and act. Just weeks after King was assassinated, Scott King continued that work, kicking off the PPC from the Memphis balcony where he had been killed. At a Mother’s Day march of welfare recipients in D.C. the following week, she highlighted the violence of U.S. political priorities. “Neglecting schoolchildren is violence. Punishing a mother and her family is violence … Ignoring medical needs is violence. Contempt for poverty is violence. Even the lack of willpower to help humanity is a sick and sinister form of violence.”\n\nScott King’s story is a reminder that many of the histories we tell, even of one of the most well-known Black families in history, are deeply inadequate. “I keep seeing these books that come out, and there are so many inaccuracies,” Scott King herself observed in a 2004 interview. “And that becomes history if you don’t correct it.” America needs the true story of its history, and part of that story was the bold, brilliant advocacy of Coretta Scott King.",

    "title": "Why America’s Oligarchs May Regret Their Obedience",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "When tech billionaires and crypto moguls hailed Donald Trump’s reelection and flocked to his inauguration ceremony and ball, million-dollar donations in hand, some were abandoning previous liberal affiliations and all were now lining up behind an openly authoritarian president. The surface rationale is that megabusiness leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Marc Andreessen are safeguarding their companies and their shareholders’ interests. The underlying explanation is that America is being reborn as an oligarchy.\n\nThis new class—with Trump megadonor Elon Musk as its self-appointed tribune—has thrown its support behind a libertarian economic agenda that maximizes private power and minimizes public accountability. Whether the billionaires’ alignment with Trump and Musk is merely pragmatic or sincerely ideological, they stand to gain from the new administration’s crash program of dismantling government and regulatory agencies. For Trump, allying with such concentrated economic power helps him consolidate political control, at the expense of democracy. This fusion of money and power is nothing new. I saw something similar take shape in my native Russia. But three decades later, the Russian oligarchs’ bargain has ended up with only one true beneficiary: Vladimir Putin.\n\nAmerica’s billionaires should take note. When extreme wealth combines forces with extreme power, the former can profit enormously for a time. As in Russia, the benefits of the executive’s policies are likely to flow upward: Super-wealthy Americans will enjoy tax breaks and deregulation for their businesses, while the poor will face rising prices, shrinking services, and reduced opportunity. But America’s tech oligarchs may discover sooner rather than later that, by undermining democratic governance, they are empowering an authoritarian president who can pick them off one by one—just as Putin did with the oligarchs who helped cement his rule.\n\nAnne Applebaum: America’s future is Hungary\n\nWhen Communism collapsed in 1991 and Russia pivoted to capitalism, the country’s wealth quickly ended up in the hands of a few newly minted businessmen. A mix of small-time entrepreneurs, opportunistic academics, mid-level functionaries, and shady characters with ties to organized crime, these men affiliated themselves with Boris Yeltsin’s post-Soviet government. By arranging loans for Yeltsin’s floundering administration in return for stakes in privatized industries, they profited directly from the fire sale of state assets.\n\nAmong the most prominent of these oligarchs, as they became known, were Boris Berezovsky, a mathematician turned media mogul; Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former Komsomol activist who became the owner of the oil-and-gas giant Yukos; and Vladimir Gusinsky, a theater-academy graduate who leveraged his ties to Moscow’s elite to build a banking, real-estate, and media empire. While these businessmen rode around in bulletproof limousines and dropped $10,000 a bottle on champagne at ritzy new nightclubs, the rest of the country—already reeling from the Washington Consensus–inspired shock therapy that dismantled price controls, triggering hyperinflation—watched their savings vanish and sank deeper into poverty.\n\nBy the 1996 election, resentment of the Yeltsin circle’s insider deals was so great that the Communist Party, in disgrace five years earlier, staged a comeback that saw its candidate compete in a runoff with Yeltsin. Into this chaotic scene came Putin, a former KGB officer who joined the Yeltsin administration that year and became its security chief in 1998. In 1999, Putin was appointed prime minister; in 2000, after Yeltsin’s resignation, he was elected president.\n\nThe oligarchs had sponsored his rise as a dependable apparatchik who would instill order and protect their state-asset acquisitions. They misjudged him: Barely a month after his inauguration, Putin reversed the master-servant hierarchy. In June, Gusinsky was arrested on corruption charges and pressured into relinquishing control of his media holdings to the state-owned Gazprom in exchange for his release. Soon after, Berezovsky fled the country when confronted with similar tactics. Both men were accused of fraud and embezzlement. Russia’s top law-enforcement officer, the prosecutor general, is—like the attorney general in the United States—a presidential nominee. These prosecutions were widely seen as politically motivated.\n\nPutin had sent a message: The oligarchs could keep their wealth as long as they obeyed his dictates and stayed out of politics. These moves met no resistance in the courts or from the Duma, Russia’s parliament. Instead, lawmakers immediately granted the president additional powers that enabled him to weaken Russian federalism—dismantling the autonomy that local elites had enjoyed under Yeltsin—and to centralize power in the Kremlin.\n\nSuperficially, Putin’s action looked like a renationalization of state assets. In practice, it was a wealth transfer to loyalists and security-service allies. This process culminated in the 2003 takeover of Yukos. Khodorkovsky, then the richest man in Russia and a notable backer of Western-style liberal democracy, was jailed. Yukos’s assets were first frozen and then sold off at auction. The main chunk went to the state-controlled Rosneft corporation, which was led by another former KGB officer, the Putin confidant Igor Sechin. Khodorkovsky’s lawyers faced retaliation for representing their client against the government prosecution.\n\nWith that, Putin had ended Russia’s brief experiment in liberalization. Now he set about reshaping the political architecture of post-Soviet Russia.\n\nThe horrific 2004 Beslan hostage crisis, when a school siege by Chechen separatists ended in a botched rescue by Russian forces and hundreds of civilian deaths, gave him his opportunity. Under the pretext of fighting terrorism, Putin abolished direct elections for provincial governors and installed Kremlin appointees. He used administrative means to suppress political opponents: Candidates seeking office faced burdensome signature requirements, registration denials, or disqualification on technicalities. Serious challengers such as Alexei Navalny faced trumped-up charges of embezzlement and fraud.\n\nPutin also moved to crush Russia’s free press by revoking licenses for independent media, forcing ownership changes, and installing editorial teams that would stick to Kremlin-approved narratives. With a series of laws, Putin escalated measures against foreign NGOs, criminalizing their activity and cutting funding for human-rights work in Russia.\n\nIn a charade of compliance with presidential term limits, Putin stood down in 2008, serving as prime minister under his protégé, President Dmitry Medvedev. Exploiting a constitutional loophole that barred only consecutive terms, Putin returned to the presidency in 2012—and then secured an amendment in 2020 that reset his term count and will allow him to remain in office until 2036. After public demonstrations against election fraud in 2011 and 2012, his government imposed harsh penalties for “unauthorized protests”; today, even a single person with a placard violates the law.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has been a major sponsor of Putin’s regime. The Church’s head since 2009 has been Patriarch Kirill, an ultra-wealthy oligarch in his own right, with a fortune estimated at $4 billion. Declaring Putin’s leadership “a miracle of God” in 2012, the patriarch has provided important ideological buttressing for Putin, reframing his neo-imperialist project as a metaphysical struggle against forces opposing the “Russian world” (a Völkisch concept encompassing any territory with a Russian-speaking population). Under Putin, Orthodox priests have become regular fixtures in schools, at official ceremonies such as rocket launches, and at the front in Ukraine.\n\nWrapped in the Russian flag and carrying an Orthodox cross, Putin has gone about making Russia great again—with the help of his obedient oligarchs. When Russia seized Crimea, in 2014, his closest allies took a cut of Ukrainian assets: Arkady Rotenberg, the president’s former judo partner, acquired confiscated land and was awarded a $3.6 billion contract to build the Crimea Bridge. By Putin’s fifth-term reelection last year, the business elite had little choice but to back his “special military operation” in Ukraine: The oligarchs’ collaboration successfully shielded them from U.S. and European sanctions, and the combined wealth of Russia’s 10 richest billionaires has grown since 2023. But there’s a catch: Even the oligarchs live in terror. Among the numerous Russian businessmen to have suffered a fatal fall from a window in recent years was Ravil Maganov, the chairman of Lukoil, after his company called for an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nRead: Trump gets a taste of Putin’s tactics\n\nPutin’s regime offers a stark illustration of how democratic institutions can be hollowed out. Some of Trump’s recent moves contain echoes of Kremlin strategy: canceling institutional checks in favor of loyalist appointments, attacking lawyers who work for opponents, demolishing independent agencies, feeding popular delusions of imperial greatness by threatening neighbors. The reforms of Musk’s DOGE outfit are set to shift public goods into private hands.\n\nAmerica is not Russia, and no billionaires are falling from windows here. The U.S. economy remains far more diverse and dynamic, and far larger, than Russia’s, but its competitive edge is already challenged by China, a threat that Trump’s tariff policy is unlikely to offset. America’s competitive advantages may start to erode under the new administration’s war on science and education. That already happened in Russia: Once a scientific and cultural powerhouse, the country is now a rigid petrostate. Over the past two decades, Russia’s scientific community has contracted by about 25 percent, thanks to declining educational standards and a brain drain of self-exiled talent.\n\nAn authoritarian oligarchy is not a pleasant place to live in. Ask my 88-year-old aunt, who was hit by a car in a provincial Russian town some years ago and can no longer leave her apartment because of the long-term injuries she sustained. After the case was investigated, she was pressured to withdraw her testimony because the driver was the son of a local official. That is how Putin’s “power vertical,” as Russian political parlance refers to his highly centralized, top-down authority, reaches into the lives of the little people. The oligarchy’s erosion of the rule of law trickles down, corroding public trust and ultimately leaving everyone—elites and ordinary citizens alike—at the mercy of arbitrary absolutism. The billionaire class now rallying behind Trump would do well to consider the implications of such a partnership.\n\nFor now, America still has a functioning electoral system, democratic institutions that have endured for centuries rather than decades, and a diverse, vibrant civil society. It also holds a vision of itself, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, in which everyone has the right to pursue a fulfilling and self-determined life. But as Putin showed, constitutions can be amended or worked around; Trump is already musing about a third term. To follow Russia’s cynical path—whereby an all-powerful ruler feeds the masses false promises of greatness and keeps the oligarchs in line with favors and threats—would be to lose sight of that vision.",

    "title": "What It Takes to Be a Trial Lawyer If You’re Not a Man",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "Last year, Elizabeth Faiella took a case representing a man who alleged that a doctor had perforated his esophagus during a routine medical procedure. Before the trial began, she and the defense attorney, David O. Doyle Jr., were summoned to a courtroom in Brevard County, Florida, for a hearing. Doyle had filed a motion seeking to “preclude emotional displays” during the trial—not by the patient, but by Faiella.\n\n“Counsel for the Plaintiff, Elizabeth Faiella, has a proclivity for displays of anguish in the presence of the jury, including crying,” Doyle wrote in his motion. Faiella’s predicted flood of tears, he continued, could be nothing more than “a shrewdly calculated attempt to elicit a sympathetic response.”\n\nFaiella told the trial judge, a man, that Doyle’s allegations were sexist and untrue. The judge asked Doyle whether he had a basis for the motion. Faiella says that he replied that he did, but the information was privileged because it came from his client. (Doyle told me the information had in fact come from other defense attorneys.) Faiella called his reply “ridiculous.” She told me: “I have never cried in a trial. Not once.”\n\nAs Faiella listened to Doyle press forward with his argument, her outrage mounted. But she had to take care not to let her anger show, fearing it would only confirm what Doyle had insinuated—that she would use emotional displays to gain an advantage in the courtroom.\n\nThe judge denied Doyle’s request, saying, in essence, “I expect both parties to behave themselves.” Afterward, Faiella confronted Doyle in the hallway. “Why would you file such a thing?” she demanded, noting that it was unprofessional, sexist, and humiliating.\n\n“I don’t understand why you are getting so upset,” she says Doyle replied. (Doyle denied that gender was the motivating factor behind filing the motion; he said he had filed such motions against male attorneys as well.)\n\nWhen I asked Faiella for a copy of Doyle’s motion, she said that she could send me examples from more than two dozen cases across her 30-year career. She said that at least 90 percent of her courtroom opponents are male, and that they file a “no-crying motion” as a matter of course. Judges always deny them, but the damage is done: The idea that she will unfairly deploy her feminine wiles to get what she wants has been planted in the judge’s mind. Though Faiella has long since learned to expect the motions, every time one crosses her desk she feels sick to her stomach. “I cannot tell you how much it demeans me,” she said. “Because I am a woman, I have to act like it doesn’t bother me, but I tell you that it does. The arrow lands every time.”\n\nFor the past two decades, law schools have enrolled roughly the same number of men and women. In 2016, for the first time, more women were admitted to law school than men. In the courtroom, however, women remain a minority, particularly in the high-profile role of first chair at trial.\n\nIn a landmark 2001 report on sexism in the courtroom, Deborah Rhode, a Stanford Law professor, wrote that women in the courtroom face what she described as a “double standard and a double bind.” Women, she wrote, must avoid being seen as “too ‘soft’ or too ‘strident,’ too ‘aggressive’ or ‘not aggressive enough.’ ”\n\nThe glass ceiling remains a reality in a host of white-collar industries, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. If the courtroom were merely another place where the advancement of women has been checked, that would be troubling, if not entirely surprising. But the stakes in the courtroom aren’t just a woman’s career development and her earning potential. The interests—and, in the criminal context, the liberty—of her client are also on the line.\n\nWhat makes the issue especially vexing are the sources of the bias—judges, senior attorneys, juries, and even the clients themselves. Sexism infects every kind of courtroom encounter, from pretrial motions to closing arguments—a glum ubiquity that makes clear how difficult it will be to eradicate gender bias not just from the practice of law, but from society as a whole.\n\nI began my career as a trial lawyer in 2001, the same year that Rhode published her report. I worked in the Federal Public Defender’s Office in Los Angeles. When I took the job, I had braced myself for the stress; almost immediately, my caseload included clients facing lengthy prison sentences for serious felonies. I did not expect to be told in explicit terms that my gender would play a significant role in how I could defend my clients, and that learning this lesson was crucial to my success and by extension to my clients’ lives. “There are things I can do that you can’t, and things you can do that I can’t” was the way one of the male supervising attorneys in my office put it.\n\nLet’s start with the clothes. In my office, and in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, where the federal prosecutors worked, the men stuck to a basic uniform: a dark suit, a crisp button-down shirt, an inoffensive tie, and a close shave or neatly trimmed beard. If they adhered to that model, their physicality was unremarkable—essentially invisible.\n\nWomen’s clothing choices, by contrast, were the subject of intense scrutiny from judges, clerks, marshals, jurors, other lawyers, witnesses, and clients. I had to be attractive, but not in a provocative way. At one trial, I took off my suit jacket at the counsel table as I reviewed my notes before the jury was seated. It was a sweltering day in Los Angeles, and the air-conditioning had yet to kick in. The judge, an older man with a mane of white hair, jabbed a finger in my direction and bellowed, “Are you stripping in my courtroom, Ms. Bazelon?” Heads swiveled, and I looked down at my sleeveless blouse, turning scarlet.\n\nObserving my female colleagues and opposing counsel as I settled into the job, I took mental notes. Medium-length or long hair was best—but not too long. Heels and skirts were preferred at trial—but not too high and definitely not too short. And pantyhose. I hated pantyhose, both the cringe-inducing word and the suffocating reality. They itched miserably and ripped. But showing up in federal court with bare legs was as unthinkable as showing up drunk.\n\nClothing may seem trivial, but what a woman wears at trial is directly related to her ability to do her job. When impeaching a witness to expose a lie, the men in my office would march up to the witness box, incriminating document in hand, and shove it in the witness’s face. I had to approach witnesses gingerly—because I was balancing on heels.\n\nIt wasn’t just men who taught me what to wear and how to act. Later in my career, I had a female supervisor who told me in no uncertain terms that I should wear makeup and color my graying hair. In fact, she told me I needed a complete makeover, and offered to pay for it. I didn’t take her money, but I did take her advice, and I’ve borne the significant cost of these expectations since. My supervisors also reminded me to smile as often as possible in order to counteract the impression that my resting facial expression was too severe. I even had to police my tone of voice. When challenging a hostile witness, I learned to take a “more in sorrow than in anger” approach.\n\nReading over my old trial transcripts, I am taken aback by how many times I said “Thank you”—and how often I apologized.\n\nThis isn’t just dated wisdom passed down from a more conservative era. Social-science research has demonstrated that when female attorneys show emotions like indignation, impatience, or anger, jurors may see them as shrill, irrational, and unpleasant. The same emotions, when expressed by men, are interpreted as appropriate to the circumstances of a case. So when I entered the courtroom, I took on the persona of a woman who dressed, spoke, and behaved in a traditionally feminine and unthreatening manner.\n\nIn some ways, this was easy. I had been raised to be polite and to show respect for authority. In other ways, this was difficult. When I got angry, I had to stifle that feeling. When my efforts failed, I feared having come across as strident—or, worse, as a bitch. When I succeeded, I felt as if I was betraying my feminist principles. But if there was a sliver of a chance that the girl-next-door approach would deliver a more favorable outcome, not taking it would be wrong. I told myself that my duty was to my client, not my gender.\n\nIn the seven years I worked as a deputy federal public defender, I fought hard for my clients, and I had my share of victories. But I was practicing law differently from many of my male colleagues and adversaries. They could resort to a bare-knuckle style. Most of what I did in the courtroom looked more like fencing. Reading over my old trial transcripts, I am taken aback by how many times I said “Thank you”—to the judge, to opposing counsel, to hostile witnesses. And by how many times I apologized.\n\nIn 2017, after nearly a decade of holding jobs that offered limited opportunities to go to court, I took a position as a clinical professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law. I’m now training students to become trial lawyers by supervising their representation of criminal defendants in San Francisco Superior Court. During my first semester, all five of my students were women. Four were women of color. Eighteen years earlier, I had been sitting where they were. I wondered what had changed.\n\nIn 1878, Clara Shortridge Foltz, who was living in San Jose, California, was left to raise five children on her own when her husband abandoned her. To support her family, Foltz decided to become a lawyer. California law prevented it: “Any white male” was eligible to practice law, but women and minorities were excluded. Undeterred, Foltz drafted the Woman Lawyer’s Bill, successfully lobbied the state legislature to pass it, took the bar exam, and, on September 5, 1878, became the first female attorney admitted to the California bar.\n\nToday, Foltz is seen in feminist legal circles as a pioneering hero. As a lawyer, she was an advocate for the poor and disadvantaged, who formed the bulk of her client base, since few people would voluntarily agree to female representation. In court, the men who opposed Foltz routinely used her gender to discredit her. In her memoirs, she recalled a prosecutor who had told the jury to reject Foltz’s arguments on these simple grounds: “She is a woman, she cannot be expected to reason. God Almighty declared her limitations.”\n\nIn 2002, Los Angeles renamed its downtown criminal courthouse after Foltz. It’s inspiring to see a woman’s name on the building; women lawyers continue to struggle to get inside, however. National data are hard to come by, but state-level studies paint a bleak picture. The New York State Bar Association, for example, found in a 2017 report that female attorneys accounted for just 25 percent of all attorneys appearing in commercial and criminal cases in courtrooms across the state. The more complex the civil litigation, the less likely a woman was to appear as lead counsel, with the percentage shrinking from 31.6 percent in one-party cases to less than 20 percent in cases involving five or more parties. The report concluded: “The low percentage of women attorneys appearing in a speaking role in courts was found at every level and in every type of court: upstate and downstate, federal and state, trial and appellate, criminal and civil, ex parte applications and multi-party matters.”\n\nOver the past year, I’ve interviewed more than two dozen female trial lawyers from across the United States. Their experiences bear out these grim findings. Beth Wilkinson, a lawyer based in Washington, D.C., told me that the number of women who litigate “bet-the-company cases”—in which millions or even billions of dollars are at stake and a corporation’s ability to survive absent a win at trial is in doubt—is “abysmally low.”\n\nWilkinson enjoyed a formidable reputation at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, a white-shoe firm where she was a partner, winning cases, bringing in new clients, and earning a high salary. But she told me she was “never in the inner circle. Big Law is a male-dominated place, and it is very hard for women to thrive in an institution built that way.” In 2016, she co-founded her own firm, Wilkinson, Walsh & Eskovitz, which represents a roster of major clients, including the NCAA, Pfizer, Duke Energy, and Georgia-Pacific.\n\nThe situation is worse for female litigators who are not white. According to a 2006 report by the American Bar Association, nearly two-thirds of women of color said they had been shut out of networking opportunities; 44 percent said they had been passed over for plum work assignments; and 43 percent said they had little opportunity to develop client relationships. In a survey and in focus groups, many described feeling lonely and perpetually on edge, anxious to avoid race- and gender-based stereotypes. One respondent said she was treated like an “exotic animal,” trotted out for photo ops at diversity and recruitment events but otherwise sidelined. An Asian American woman recounted being asked to translate a document written in Korean and having to explain that she was Chinese.\n\n“I want a Jew lawyer,” a client once said to me. I told him I was Jewish. “No, a man Jew lawyer,” he responded.\n\nKadisha Phelps is a 37-year-old associate at a Miami-based firm. She worked her way up to first chair in part by bringing in her own business: She’s built a cottage industry representing former NFL players who claim that they were scammed out of their earnings by unscrupulous financial advisers. Phelps, who is African American, describes herself as “a pit bull in a skirt.” But she told me that when she goes to court, she often has to bring one of her male partners along—even if he knows little about the case. “That older white man at the table carries some kind of credibility,” she explained. “It gives judges the assurance that it’s not just some little black girl out there on her own.”\n\nIn July 2017, Phelps got into a heated debate with a male trial judge about how many depositions she would be allowed in a case her firm valued at $2 million. Phelps had asked Douglas Broeker to join her in court to play the role of the silent white partner. When Phelps pressed her point, the judge turned to Broeker. “Maybe you should take a few minutes and walk out and try to calm your associate down,” he said.\n\nAs Phelps’s experience suggests, it can be difficult to separate the various forms of discrimination women face. “I want a Jew lawyer,” a male client once said to me. I told him I was Jewish. “No, a man Jew lawyer,” he responded.\n\nThe problem isn’t merely that women are outnumbered in the courtroom. It’s that men occupy the positions of power in staggering proportions. Women make up only 33 percent of federal trial-court judges. As of June, Donald Trump had made 73 U.S.-attorney nominations. Sixty-six of them are men. The state-level statistics are just as dismal: 30 percent of trial-court judges are women. In 2015, according to the Women’s Donor Network, an advocacy group, 17 percent of elected prosecutors were women; women of color made up 1 percent. In the criminal context, the odds are that a female lawyer will face off against a male prosecutor in a contest overseen by a male judge.\n\nNot all male prosecutors and judges harbor sexist views of women, though many do. Male lawyers referred to their female peers as “honey” and “sweetheart” in court frequently enough that, in 2016, the American Bar Association felt compelled to pass a rule designed to curtail the use of such demeaning terms. Judges, for their part, can reinforce gender stereotypes, implicitly normalizing them and even explicitly enforcing them. Female trial attorneys routinely report that male judges critique their voices as too loud or too shrill.\n\n(Isabel Seliger / Sepia)\n\nRomany McNamara is a public defender in Alameda County’s Oakland office. In 2011, she had just started litigating felony trials. One morning, a trial judge called two of McNamara’s cases before she’d had a chance to introduce herself to her new clients or explain the legal process to them. When she asked for a brief delay in the proceedings, she says, the judge berated her in front of the packed courtroom. “He likes to humiliate young female trial lawyers,” she told me.\n\nMcNamara had a third case that day. The judge waited until the end of the calendar to call it. When the courtroom emptied and McNamara started to walk out, she says, the judge beckoned her to approach the bench. As she stood before him, he offered a lukewarm apology, emphasizing the importance he placed on running his courtroom efficiently. Then he leaned in and said softly, “Don’t do it again.” McNamara says the judge then struck her on the back of her hand, hard enough to leave a mark.\n\n“I could see the outline of where he hit me in white before it turned bright pink,” she told me. “There was nothing overtly sexual about it,” she said. “But that was absolutely the undertone, like: You’ve been a bad girl.”\n\nMcNamara told a colleague about the incident; I spoke with that colleague, and he confirmed that she had told him what happened, and that they had debated how she should respond. McNamara initially decided against filing a formal complaint. This “wasn’t just any judge,” she said. “He was a kingmaker. He brokered deals.” She feared the repercussions of calling him out. “I thought he could ruin my career.”\n\nYears passed, but McNamara remained angry and disgusted. In 2016, she filed a complaint against the judge with California’s Commission on Judicial Performance, describing the 2011 incident and accusing him of having physically assaulted her. The complaint has yet to be resolved.\n\nMost judges, of course, don’t strike female attorneys in their courtroom. But at various points during the first semester of the clinic, my all-female class of aspiring trial lawyers experienced lower-wattage versions of such treatment.\n\nIn November, one of my students was slated to argue a motion before a judge who I knew could be nasty to female lawyers. Playing the judge’s role in a mock argument to prepare her, I went out of my way to be sneering and combative, my best imitation of his behavior. And indeed, in court, when my student objected to opposing counsel’s request for a continuance so that a police officer could testify, the judge laid into her for lacking professional courtesy. She tried to explain her reasoning, but he interrupted, not allowing her to demonstrate that the matter could be resolved without the officer having to testify. (Two months later, a different judge agreed: The officer didn’t testify, and we won the motion.)\n\nIn class later, I asked my students whether they thought the judge would have treated a male attorney the same way. There was a long pause. “That’s a joke, right?” one of them said.\n\nJohnnie Cochran told one female associate: Be “the person in the courtroom that everyone loves.”\n\nEven when arguing before the most enlightened judge and against fair-minded opposing counsel, women enter the courtroom at a disadvantage. In America’s adversarial system, the ability to compel useful testimony from a hostile witness is often essential to winning at trial. When you invade a witness’s personal space, the witness may feel stress, anxiety, and anger. These emotions may lead the witness to blurt out helpful information. In general, jurors tend to be impressed by lawyers who demonstrate power and control in the courtroom. But for female lawyers, projecting power and control is a tricky proposition. When male attorneys show flashes of anger—a raised voice, a pointed finger—juries tend to view them favorably, as “tough zealous advocates,” according to research cited in a 2004 Law & Psychology Review article. When women betray anger, they may be seen as overly emotional.\n\nTrial lawyers routinely talk with members of the jury when a case is over in order to get their feedback, and jurors can be quite candid in their assessments. Kila Baldwin, a partner at the personal-injury firm Kline & Specter, tries about five cases a year and has won a string of multimillion-dollar verdicts. “I always wear heels in front of the jury unless I am in pain,” she told me. Last June, Baldwin was in pain: The tendons in her feet were inflamed, so she wore flats to a trial. Afterward, a female juror told her that she had not cared for her shoes. “I never have a casual Friday,” Baldwin said. “You get less respect.”\n\nSome female trial lawyers have succeeded in turning the attributes associated with their gender—compassion, warmth, accessibility—to their advantage, particularly once they get in front of a jury. Shawn Holley, a prominent entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles, told me that she makes her gender work for her. She described her courtroom affect as “polite and charming”—but not so polite or charming that it “gets in the way of the job that needs to get done.” Holley cut her teeth working as an associate for Johnnie Cochran during the O. J. Simpson trial. She said it was this quality—a sweet steeliness—that led Cochran to recruit her. He encouraged her to be “the person in the courtroom that everyone loves while being as capable and prepared as possible.” She followed his advice, and today she represents high-profile clients including Justin Bieber, Lindsay Lohan, and Kim Kardashian.\n\nHolley has constructed a persona that works for her in her area of the law. But when I talked with her and other women who have enjoyed courtroom success, I saw a pattern emerge. Many of them excelled in areas where being seen as a woman first and a lawyer second gave them an advantage over their male adversaries.\n\nEmbracing traits traditionally associated with women seems to pay off particularly well in litigation involving so-called women’s issues. In many of these cases, female trial lawyers are favored and even actively recruited. In the civil arena, for example, women have thrived in high-stakes medical-malpractice lawsuits where the plaintiff claims that the defendant’s product injured her genitalia or reproductive organs.\n\nFor a number of years, Ethicon, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, has been defending itself against tens of thousands of cases alleging defects in mesh devices it created for surgical implantation in the vagina to alleviate incontinence, among other conditions. Some patients who had the devices implanted experienced complications such as bleeding and the perforation of internal organs.\n\nIn 2013, Kimberly Adkins, a 48-year-old Ohio woman, sued Ethicon, claiming that the mesh sling implanted to treat her incontinence had caused permanent internal damage, leaving her unable to have sex. Ethicon retained Kim Bueno, a partner at the Texas-based law firm Scott Douglass & McConnico, to serve as lead counsel. In May 2017, the case went to trial in downtown Philadelphia. My sister Jill was picked to be one of the jurors.\n\nI could not fathom why Ethicon would let Jill on the jury. I figured that my sister, a mother of two, would naturally be sympathetic to Adkins. For many women, minor urinary incontinence is a fact of life after childbirth—we cross our legs before sneezing and locate the nearest bathroom immediately upon entering an unfamiliar place.\n\nBut Jill, who has a doctorate in education policy, also comes from a family of lawyers—including our father, her husband, and three sisters. Bueno told me later that she was counting on jurors like her: highly educated individuals who would listen to both sides and apply the law to the facts.\n\nI’m confident my sister did exactly that, but she told me she had been impressed by more than just Bueno’s command of the law. Jill had related to her. She was the only woman lawyer in a courtroom packed with attorneys. The men were dour and dull; Bueno was personable and dynamic. She referred to the female anatomy with confidence and ease. By contrast, Adkins’s all-male team struggled when forced to ask personal questions. “If you can’t say the word vagina, you are probably not the best lawyer for the case,” Jill said. By tiptoeing around their client’s injuries, Adkins’s male lawyers undersold her pain and failed to prove its direct link to Ethicon.\n\nA turning point in the trial, Jill told me, was Bueno’s cross-examination of Adkins. “She kept her same friendly demeanor while asking some very tough questions. She had to break [Adkins] down and demonstrate that she was not a reliable witness. And she did it without seeming mean or horrible.” In a case involving complicated issues relating to female genitalia, my sister said, “I trusted her more because she was a woman.”\n\nIn a sweeping victory for Ethicon, the jury found that the mesh had been defective but that Adkins had failed to prove that it had caused her injuries. (In August 2017, the judge overrode the jury’s verdict; Ethicon has appealed.) When I spoke with Bueno, she told me that she has been involved in hundreds of mesh cases. “A woman is able to cross-examine a female personal-injury victim with greater sensitivity,” she said. “She can probe a little further without coming across as attacking the victim.”\n\nLynne Hermle conducted what was perhaps the highest-profile cross-examination of 2015. Ellen Pao was seeking $16 million in damages from her former employer, the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, claiming that she had experienced gender discrimination—and had been fired when she’d spoken up about it. Hermle, a partner at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, was the lead counsel for the all-female defense team. Hermle is the senior partner in Orrick’s Silicon Valley employment group, where 10 of the 13 attorneys are women. “I think women are better at the conflict aspect in the courtroom,” she told me. “We are able to confront people directly and dismantle false stories in a way that men can’t do without coming across as a bully.” In the Pao case, “I had a really tight, well-crafted cross-examination that never involved shouting.” The proof, Hermle said, was in the result: The jury ruled for her client.\n\nYet Hermle’s success in the Pao case came at the expense of a woman ostensibly fighting for gender equity in an industry notorious for its chauvinism. I asked her whether she saw an irony in this. Hermle said no. Pao, she maintained, was simply the wrong messenger for a righteous cause.\n\nHermle’s success has been a boon for her practice at Orrick. But a nagging question remains: Would women like Bueno and Hermle have had the same opportunities if they’d pursued a legal career in which they would not have been perceived as having a gender-based advantage—as, say, a prosecutor in a homicide division? Hermle argued that taking on cases in which being a woman offers an advantage can provide a ladder up and out. “Women can use these [cases] to get high-profile trial experience, which is hard to get, but ultimately I think that falls away once you achieve a certain stature.” She told me that only about 40 percent of her cases involve gender and that some of her biggest wins came when she was defending companies against discrimination claims based on race, ethnicity, disability, or religion. Since her win in the Ellen Pao case, Hermle has defended both Twitter and Microsoft in class-action lawsuits brought by employees alleging gender discrimination.\n\nEvery woman I interviewed said she had experienced Deborah Rhode’s double bind: the imperative to excel under stressful courtroom conditions without abandoning the traits that judges and juries positively associate with being female. It is a devilishly narrow path to walk, and can severely hinder the ability to offer a client the best and most zealous defense.\n\nI know this because in the middle of a case in 2013, I consciously stopped trying to walk that path. My client had been convicted in 1979 of a murder he did not commit and had spent 34 years in prison. The case against him was preposterous, and the refusal by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office to concede error infuriated me. Just days into the evidentiary hearing that would determine his fate, what was left of the state’s case fell apart.\n\nFor the first and only time in my life as a litigator, I knew we were going to win. As the hearing had gone on, I had grown angrier. Now I had nothing to lose by pretending otherwise. When I went after the police, who I believed had lied and covered up evidence, I was by turns angry, sarcastic, and, yes, aggressive. My cheeks were red, not from shame but from righteous indignation. My voice shook as I questioned my client, not because I was being hysterical or manipulative but because the travesty of his stolen life broke my heart. In closing, I raised my voice and slammed my fist into my open palm as I argued to the judge—a woman—that the case had been a colossal miscarriage of justice. It was exhilarating to allow myself to feel the full range of emotional responses and to use the full array of tactics available to men.\n\nThe judge threw out the conviction. Afterward, my client’s 76-year-old mother paid me what I consider the greatest compliment of my career. Gripping my wrists, she looked at me and said, “You are a trial beast.”\n\nI tell my female law students that their body and demeanor will be under relentless scrutiny from every corner of the courtroom.\n\nIt would make for a tidy ending to say that I am training my law students to be trial beasts. But it would not be true. The case I just described, tried before a female judge, and in which I was armed with overwhelming evidence of my client’s innocence, comes along once or twice in a career in criminal court—if ever. My students will litigate murkier cases in courtrooms controlled by men, facing juries who will be more willing to listen to and be convinced by a traditionally feminine woman.\n\nIn 1820, Henry Brougham, a lawyer tasked with defending Queen Caroline before the House of Lords against allegations by her husband, King George IV, that she had committed adultery and should be stripped of her crown, explained his role this way: “An advocate, in the discharge of his duty, knows but one person in all the world, and that person is his client. To save that client by all means and expedients, and at all hazards and costs to other persons, and, among them, to himself, is his first and only duty.”\n\nI’ve always loved that definition of a lawyer’s work and its description of the sacrifices we make for our clients. But in the courtroom, whether as an attorney or as an instructor, I’m constantly reminded that women lawyers don’t have access to the same “means and expedients” that men do. So I tell my female students the truth: that their body and demeanor will be under relentless scrutiny from every corner of the courtroom. That they will have to pay close attention to what they wear and how they speak and move. That they will have to find a way to metabolize these realities, because adhering to biased expectations and letting slights roll off their back may be the most effective way to advance the interests of their clients in courtrooms that so faithfully reflect the sexism of our society.\n\nSometimes I worry that I am part of the problem, that I am holding my students back by using valuable class time to pass on the same unfair rules that were passed on to me. And then we go to court.",

    "title": "Protest in Trump 2.0 Looks Different",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "Last Saturday, I paid a visit to a little slice of the resistance in its current, attenuated form. Since Donald Trump’s second inauguration, there have been many street protests, but they have been small and diffuse: a few hundred people angered by the defunding of USAID, or a couple thousand in support of national parks. The most organized effort so far, the 50501 movement (for “50 states. 50 protests. 1 movement.”), is a coalition of activists whose name telegraphs breadth much more than depth.\n\nAt an intersection outside a Tesla showroom in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn, about 200 people were gathered on the sidewalk. They banged tambourines and clanged cymbals, trying to get passing trucks and cars to honk against Elon Musk, Trump’s most important adviser and a purveyor of electric cars. Of all the responses to the new administration, the anti-Tesla protests have left a bruise—as of this writing, the company’s stock has declined by about half since December. There were signs demanding Musk’s deportation, and one that asked drivers to Honk If You Think Elon Is a Dork. Someone in a gorilla suit held up a placard that read He Kills Monkeys, Too.\n\nFor all the energy on the street—and it was energetic—there was a preponderance of gray hair, and not many young people or strollers in evidence. Those who showed up seemed to have a highly developed muscle memory for activism, going back perhaps to the anti–Iraq War demonstrations in 2003, or even Vietnam. This appeared to be a protest by and for a committed core. Maybe the most revealing poster was one that declared The Protests Will Get Bigger Until the Constitution is Respected. This was a threat, of course, but also an acknowledgment that there was plenty of room to grow.\n\nNevertheless, for those in the exhausted anti-Trump coalition, these bursts of opposition are giving hope. Today, a coalition of liberal groups under the banner “Hands Off!” is planning hundreds of such actions around the country. This is the kind of activity that has led members of Harvard’s Crowd Counting Consortium, which tracks acts of civil dissent, to conclude recently that the resistance is “alive and well,” with protests “far more numerous and frequent than skeptics might suggest.” They have what at first glance seems like an unexpected finding: In February 2025, twice as many protests took place as in February 2017, during the tumultuous beginning of Trump’s first term: 2,085 versus 937. The major caveat is that what they count as a protest event could be a couple of people handing out flyers on campus. Altogether, the number of actual protesters is far, far below what it was eight years ago.\n\nWhy Canadians are better than Americans at protesting Trump right now\n\nThe best estimate for this past February was somewhere from 125,000 to 184,000 participants, according to Jeremy Pressman, one of the consortium’s co-directors and a professor at the University of Connecticut. This would put the average protest size anywhere from 60 to 88 people. In March, Pressman said, those numbers increased significantly, but the per-protest average stayed roughly the same.\n\nWhat this suggests, at best, is a different model of protest movement: highly decentralized, moving at a snail’s pace, more a slog than a resistance. “Something is happening,” the journalist Ali Velshi wrote on MSNBC last week, “a different kind of movement building right now, one that has had steady and sustained momentum.” In The Bulwark, Jonathan V. Last emphasized the strategic advantage of a movement that makes its way from the hinterlands toward Washington.\n\nIt is different, but is it better? Is a single protest of 100,000 people equal to 1,000 actions with 100 people at each? I posed this zen koan of a question to Erica Chenoweth, a Harvard professor and Consortium co-director who coined the idea that if any protest movement drew 3.5 percent of a country’s population, it could achieve its goals. (That would equal nearly 12 million people in the United States today.) Does it matter how you get to this figure, all at once or bit by bit? “We don’t really know,” Chenoweth told me, “and conceivably either path produces momentum.”\n\nSo far into Trump 2.0, though, the path of decentralized slowness has had a paradoxical effect: It’s giving activists lots to do but is leaving a much larger population of dissenters without an expressive outlet. What makes a disaffected Gen Zer or a busy Millennial parent drop what they are doing and head into the streets is very different from what motivates hard-core protesters to pick up their cymbals. That much larger group needs to feel both the safety and the collective impact that comes with a mass march. “Power springs up between men when they act together and vanishes the moment they disperse,” the philosopher Hannah Arendt wrote in The Human Condition. Most people join protests to express that power, not to emphasize their marginality. And it is precisely this type of action that, in the face of one barrier after another, feels more difficult than it ever did.\n\nTrump’s first term was punctuated by a series of monster gatherings: the Women’s March that greeted his inauguration (estimated at as many as 4.6 million people all over the country), the March for Our Lives following the 2018 Parkland shooting (1.2 million), and—dwarfing all previous American protest movements—the Black Lives Matter demonstrations after the killing of George Floyd (anywhere from 15 million to 26 million people, according to polls taken at the time). The Women’s March was highly organized and concentrated, while the protests in June 2020 were largely spontaneous and spread out. But what made all of these significant was the measure by which protest has long been judged: the overwhelming numbers of people who took part.\n\nOn its face, the slackening of interest in demonstrating against Trump in his second term—despite the preponderance of issues that trigger his opposition every day—can be understood simply as a change in the political atmosphere. Trump’s 2017 win was a shock for liberals expecting to inaugurate the first female president. His failure to win the popular vote made his election feel contestable, even illegitimate. And powerful people, even a number of Republicans, were ready to stand up to Trump’s overreach. All of this created a sense that there was a door that protest could push open. None of these factors operates in 2025: Trump is not a surprise, he won the popular vote, and both his party and the business elite are fully on his side. Pressman wondered if this has created “a different kind of shock,” one that is more destabilizing than motivating: “Maybe people were just kind of pushed on their back feet. And it takes a while, or ever, to be involved in it.”\n\nThere is no resistance\n\nAfter the University of Glasgow lecturer Michael T. Heaney surveyed participants from both the Women’s March and January’s much shrunken People’s March, he emerged with a clear contrast. There was a 12 percent drop in enthusiasm about politics, he told me; “hope” as a motivator for protesting fell by 10 percent, and “pride” by 9 percent. What rose from 2017 to 2025? “Frustration,” by 3 percent, and “anger,” by 8 percent.\n\nAlongside demoralization runs justifiable caution; the act of protest itself has become more dangerous. Not only has the president said that he would have little compunction about using the military to deal with “the enemy from within,” but the tactics of surveillance—including facial recognition, geolocation tracking, and AI-enhanced identification—have gotten more pervasive and sophisticated. The police and the FBI have long used and abused tools for monitoring protest—this sordid history goes back to COINTELPRO in the 1960s. But the average protester at a peaceful 20th-century gathering could at least assume that they would melt into a sea of indistinguishable people. Technology has made that impossible. There is no safety in numbers. You cannot disappear.\n\nSimply being present at a protest makes you vulnerable, as Chris Gilliard, a Just Tech fellow at the Social Science Research Council, told me: “All the devices that people carry and wear are constantly extruding data, from the car they might have used to get there to the cameras in subway stations to their watches and their phones and everything else you can imagine.” Among the safety instructions provided by an organizer of today’s nonviolent demonstrations was the bolded sentence “Do not assume you are safe.” Also: “MASK. UP … disable location, biometrics and data on your phone, at the very least. Have your emergency contacts written on your body.” This is not a welcoming message for an infrequent protester or a citizen looking to voice her concern for the first time. No wonder that a smaller, local protest is more of a draw at the moment. “It’s easier to control; it’s just easier to call it off suddenly if you need to; it’s easier to get away,” Chenoweth told me. “There’s lots of reasons why smaller, more nimble groups would feel more safe.”\n\nThere are also an increasing number of laws targeting protest. The volume of federal and state legislation has spiked in the past few years, and particularly since January; 41 anti-protest bills have been introduced in 21 states and in Congress in 2025. This crop includes bills by Congress against protesters “deliberately delaying traffic,” disrupting in any way the construction of a pipeline, or wearing a mask that “oppresses” another person. Among the Trump administration’s demands on Columbia University in return for restoring $400 million in funding was a ban on masks, which many peaceful protesters wear not to menace others but to avoid being identified by facial recognition.\n\nMost of the movements we now consider heroic were originally perceived as lawless nuisances, but Trump has reframed and stigmatized protest in novel ways, conflating nonviolent gatherings with destructive mobs. The reactions to the killing of George Floyd, which did include acts of vandalism and looting, were overwhelmingly peaceful, according to a study by the group Armed Conflict Location & Event Data. But the Black Lives Matter protests of that summer are now remembered by Trump and his supporters as nothing more than a series of riots. The pro-Palestinian activism of the past year and a half has been characterized at times by intimidation, which may have undermined the reputation of protest. But Trump has gone further by painting all legitimate expressions of distress over mass death in Gaza as “pro-Hamas” and moving to deport noncitizens who had anything to do with it. Mahmoud Khalil, the former Columbia graduate student whose deportation is now pending, became an obvious target for the government precisely because he openly protested, unmasked.\n\nChristopher L Eisgruber: The cost of the government’s attack on Columbia\n\nAs recently as two years ago, the act of picking up a sign and walking out your door to join a march could feel affirming, even joyous. Now it comes with the fear of surveillance and recrimination, the possibility of felony arrest, and, as a result, a deep sense of resignation.\n\nWhy does size matter when it comes to protest? Chenoweth’s magic number notwithstanding, the reasons are less tangible than a simple equation. Large demonstrations are a performance of plurality, with individuals transcending their own individuality to express a larger will. This can happen only when the public around you is more than just the person in the gorilla suit who usually shows up to these things. The experience can be bolstering. It can reassure you not just that you aren’t alone, but that you are a citizen among citizens. The sociologist Émile Durkheim had a wonderful phrase for this: collective effervescence.\n\nAnd for those watching from on high—senators, judges, CEOs—mass protests are physical manifestations of public opinion. They might make a singular person in the throng invisible, but they make their opinion super-visible. Whatever one feels in retrospect about the 2020 BLM protests, every sector of society had to contend with their enormity—it was a moment when even the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, seemed to feel compelled to take a knee. Trump’s crusade to root out DEI is, in many ways, a backlash to the changes these protests spawned. Outside the U.S., consider a recent textbook example of mass mobilization leading to a successful outcome: the 2023 marches in Israel in response to Benjamin Netanyahu’s judicial reforms. These protests effectively shut down the country and forced Netanyahu to relent.\n\nThe most optimistic story activists tell about what is happening now is one of incubation: You can’t get to big unless you go through small. Groups are forming coalitions, developing organizational structures, testing the waters locally. This is crucial work for any movement that wants to be long-lasting. One of the major critiques of the protests that blazed so brightly in Trump’s first term is that they largely flamed out very quickly. So this time could be different. Hunter Dunn, a student at Pepperdine University who is also a national press liaison for the 50501 movement, told me that he is a rarity at these protests because he isn’t a Gen Xer or a Boomer. But as a young person fighting what he described as the hopelessness of his fellow young people, he too has visions of the movement culminating in a classic 1963-style march on Washington. “I don’t think we can just get millions of people there tomorrow if we announce that,” he said. “We have to build towards it over weeks, months, even maybe over a year, because it takes that long to build a movement that is strong enough to go to Washington, go there peacefully, but go there unafraid of the government.”\n\nYet there is also a pessimistic version, one the activists are not telling: that this is a slog without end. Not a slow gathering with a grand finale, but a defanged alternative to mass mobilization; not the prelude to an eruption, but a reliably timed release valve.\n\nThere is no reason yet to think that this will be the story of protest in Trump’s second term. Last week, Senator Chris Murphy said that Democratic Party resistance might require “mass-scale mobilization.” This weekend’s protests may well be an early inflection point in that direction—or they may just continue the scattered pattern seen so far. A few activists also pointed me to the large rallies that have greeted Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on their ongoing “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. What was remarked upon was the size of the crowds—more than 30,000 in Denver—the kind of “surprising number,” as Chenoweth put it, that matters for creating momentum.\n\nOn a Reddit post drumming up support for the country-wide April 5 protests—more than 1,000 are planned—one user had their own unequivocal answer to the question of how best to build momentum. “We ask you to make it to the largest planned protest you are able to,” protectresist wrote. “200 people each at 100 protests will not make the news. 20,000 people at one protest will.”",

    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "This article was updated on April 7, 2025, at 8:40 pm.\n\nThe Supreme Court is about to decide whether the Trump administration can exile Americans to a gulag overseas and then leave them there.\n\nThe Trump administration wants everyone to believe that the case challenging its deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador’s infamous Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, is about the government’s right to deport undocumented immigrants, or gang members, or terrorists. But it’s actually about whether the United States government can kidnap someone off the street and then maroon them, incommunicado, in a prison abroad with little hope of release. Human-rights groups have said that they have yet to find anyone freed from CECOT, and the Salvadoran government has previously said anyone imprisoned there will “never leave.”\n\nToday, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to lift a federal-court order telling the administration to retrieve Abrego Garcia. This afternoon, Chief Justice John Roberts blocked the order temporarily. A short time later, the majority issued a per curiam decision in a separate case, allowing deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to continue, albeit under judicial supervision.\n\nAs my colleague Nick Miroff reported, the Trump administration acknowledged in court that Abrego Garcia was deported because of an “administrative error.” Abrego Garcia has been in the U.S. since he was 16, having fled El Salvador and come to the U.S. illegally after gangs threatened his family. He is married to an American citizen, and has a 5-year-old child. In 2019, a judge gave him a protected status known as “withdrawal of removal,” ordering the government not to send him back to El Salvador. The Trump administration has alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, based on the word of a single anonymous informant six years ago, and the fact that Abrego Garcia was wearing Chicago Bulls attire.\n\nAdam Serwer: Trump’s Salvadoran gulag\n\nIn its majority opinion rejecting the government’s argument, though, judges from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that the record “shows that Abrego Garcia has no criminal history, in this country or anywhere else, and that Abrego Garcia is a gainfully employed family man who lives a law abiding and productive life,” and that “if the Government wanted to prove to the district court that Abrego Garcia was a ‘prominent’ member of MS-13, it has had ample opportunity to do so but has not—nor has it even bothered to try.” Abrego Garcia is not an exception—an analysis by CBS News found that three-quarters of the more than 200 men deported to El Salvador lacked criminal records.\n\nEven though the Trump administration conceded that Abrego Garcia was deported by mistake, it is insisting that federal courts cannot order his return. “A judicial order that forces the Executive to engage with a foreign power in a certain way, let alone compel a certain action by a foreign sovereign, is constitutionally intolerable,” it said in a court filing. The implications of this argument may not be immediately obvious, but if federal courts cannot order the return of someone exiled to a foreign gulag by mistake, then the administration is free to exile citizens and then claim they did so in error, while leaving them to rot.\n\nAs the legal scholar Steve Vladeck wrote, “A world in which federal courts lacked the power to order the government to take every possible step to bring back to the United States individuals like Abrego Garcia is a world in which the government could send any of us to a Salvadoran prison without due process, claim that the misstep was a result of ‘administrative error,’ and thereby wash its hands of any responsibility for what happens next.” If the Trump administration prevails here, it could disappear anyone, even an American citizen. Several have already been swept up and detained in recent ICE raids. Whether you can imagine yourself in Abrego Garcia’s position or not, all of our fates are ultimately tied to his.\n\nDeporting people without due process is what’s actually “constitutionally intolerable,” given that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee due process of law. Disappearing people off the street and exiling them is “constitutionally intolerable” for the same reasons. Sending people who have never been convicted of any crime to CECOT, a prison where advocates allege that inmates are routinely abused, may also be “constitutionally intolerable,” given the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. But whatever their constitutional status, all of these things should be morally intolerable to any decent human being.\n\nRead: An ‘administrative error’ sends a Maryland father to a Salvadoran prison\n\nThis should be one of those cases in which the justices are unanimous. If the Constitution’s commitments to due process mean anything, they should mean that the government cannot send people to be imprisoned by a foreign nation without a shred of evidence that they’ve committed any crime. American “history and tradition” produced a system designed to reject arbitrary powers such as these, with the conscious fear that “parchment barriers” would provide little protection against an “overbearing majority” willing to violate rights. Nevertheless, I have little doubt that someone will try to argue that the Framers who wrote two due-process clauses into the Constitution actually loved disappearing people to foreign prisons.\n\n“The facts of this case thus present the potential for a disturbing loophole: namely that the government could whisk individuals to foreign prisons in violation of court orders and then contend, invoking its Article II powers, that it is no longer their custodian, and there is nothing that can be done,” Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his concurrence. “It takes no small amount of imagination to understand that this is a path of perfect lawlessness, one that courts cannot condone.”\n\nThis is eloquent and correct, but this lawlessness is happening precisely because the nation’s highest court condoned it in advance. The right-wing justices on the Roberts Court have repeatedly rewritten the Constitution to Donald Trump’s benefit, first by nullifying the anti-insurrection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment, and then by inventing an imperial presidential immunity that is nowhere in the text of the document. It is no surprise that Trump is now acting as though he is above the law. After all, the Roberts Court all but granted him permission.\n\nIn the ruling in the Alien Enemies Act case, although the Court unanimously decided that the detainees are entitled to judicial review, its decision states those deported have to challenge their detentions in the jurisdiction where they are held. The risk, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted in her dissent, is that “individuals who are unable to secure counsel, or who cannot timely appeal an adverse judgment … face the prospect of removal directly into the perilous conditions of El Salvador’s CECOT, where detainees suffer egregious human rights abuses.”\n\n“The implication of the Government’s position is that not only noncitizens but also United States citizens could be taken off the streets, forced onto planes, and confined to foreign prisons with no opportunity for redress if judicial review is denied unlawfully before removal,” Sotomayor wrote. “History is no stranger to such lawless regimes, but this Nation’s system of laws is designed to prevent, not enable, their rise.”\n\nThe Roberts Court should not congratulate itself over this ruling. America remains on the path to “perfect lawlessness” Wilkinson described, largely thanks to the justices.",

    "title": "The Late-Night Experiment That Puts Comedy First",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "On the first episode of Everybody’s Live With John Mulaney, Netflix’s new talk show, the comedian gathered a panel of 11 actors who have played Willy Loman, the tragic protagonist of the classic play Death of a Salesman. He lobbed queries at the group, which included recognizable stars (among them Christopher Lloyd) and fresh-faced students, asking them to answer in character—but not about their performances or the play itself. Instead, the host asked such questions as “How much screen time should an adolescent get?” and “Are movies too violent?”\n\nThis meeting of the Willy Lomans was a strange, charming, and original bit, the kind of thing that seemed like it could only have sprung from Mulaney’s mind; he’s long delighted in giving old-school American entertainment a modern tweak. It was a fantastically irrelevant piece of comedy that also let the comedian react to contemporary issues in his own specific manner: by gleefully summoning avatars of the broken American working man and using them to expose the ridiculous way we live now. This type of self-assured humor is core to Mulaney’s comedic sensibility—and a large part of what’s made his late-night experiment so fascinating.\n\nMulaney may very well roll his eyes at that analysis, and he’d probably be right to do so. The bulk of Everybody’s Live is clearly designed for the comedian’s amusement. The hour-long program, which airs Wednesdays and is Netflix’s first foray into weekly live programming, builds upon the six-episode series he did for the streamer in 2024, called Everybody’s in L.A. The ornery character actor Richard Kind is his announcer, barking non sequiturs from behind a podium. Each episode has a conversation topic with no particular connection to the week at hand, like lending people money or funeral planning; each one is just a subject of interest to Mulaney. His guests are a mix of celebrities and experts, yet the celebs make no effort to plug whatever current projects they may have. And Mulaney takes calls from viewers live on air, though if the person on the other end of the line rambles for too long, he will bark at them to hurry up.\n\nIn constructing this loopy hangout session, Mulaney is taking the standard talk-show format and languidly injecting it with some disorder. The audience never knows what might happen, but there’s also little chance of something truly maniacal going on. Mostly, the host is happy to chitchat, with pals and strangers alike. He has shown that he is as much an acolyte of the storied genre as he is an eager dismantler of it: When he emerged as one of the leading stand-up comedians of his generation, Mulaney already had more than a little Johnny Carson to him. Like the late talk-show veteran, he’s a reedy-voiced midwesterner with a face every mother could love. Mulaney’s schtick, however, carries a salty edge. It wasn’t too hard, while watching him perform onstage, to imagine the comedian ending up somewhere like The Tonight Show, delivering zingers from behind a desk.\n\nBut late night has become a rapidly decaying format, as broadcast television—where it primarily lives—slouches toward extinction. CBS just canceled After Midnight, the variety program hosted by the stand-up comic Taylor Tomlinson, which airs after Stephen Colbert’s Late Show; the network has no plans to replace the series or fill its time slot. When Conan O’Brien retired from hosting Conan on TBS, the cable channel began airing sitcom reruns in its stead. The Tonight Show, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, is still a TV institution; meanwhile, its excellent sister show Late Night With Seth Meyers, has been shedding budget, losing the house band last year. ABC will seemingly retain Jimmy Kimmel as long as he wants to keep doing Jimmy Kimmel Live—it’s currently in its 23rd season—yet his deal expires this year, and he’s yet to sign a new one. Shows from other, newer entrants in the late-night field, like the comedy duo Desus and Mero and the Daily Show fixture Samantha Bee, also ended prematurely.\n\nRead: Comedy’s most erudite buffoon\n\nMulaney has many advantages at Netflix that his conventional-television peers don’t, however. He doesn’t have to worry as much about ratings; he does only one show a week, with just 12 episodes currently planned, and there’s more room to break from the status quo on a streaming service that has sought to upset traditional media’s apple carts. At the same time, Everybody’s Live harkens back to a chattier, looser era—like The Merv Griffin Show, where interviews could run half an hour or longer, or Tom Snyder’s The Tomorrow Show, a newsier hour of talk that aired after Carson’s The Tonight Show for eight years. Focusing the conversation on a particular subject reminds me of Bill Maher’s shows Politically Incorrect and Real Time, though Maher tackles more topical material; taking live calls reminds me of the stand-up comic Chris Gethard’s truly riotous The Chris Gethard Show, which is still maybe the most electrifying attempt to remake the late-night genre of the past decade.\n\nThe resulting balance of serious and silly is perfectly amusing for a Mulaney fan like myself. Others might find the pithy gags a touch indulgent: Mulaney spends time fumbling around with a delivery robot and tossing beverages to his befuddled guests. The variety of pretaped sketches, including the Willy Lomans bit, may also fit into this category. But the pointlessness, as O’Brien emphasized in his conversation with Mulaney on his podcast last week, is part of the point. Rather than adopt the typical structure of a late-night show—celebrities telling cheeky, canned stories boiled down to 10 minutes or less—the host embraces weird, sometimes confusing antics.\n\nO’Brien, one of Mulaney’s most apparent influences, articulated the appeal of this approach in their conversation: “We live in this era where I think people got intoxicated at some point with comedy having a point, and comedy meaning something, and comedy driving the conversation,” O’Brien said, referring to Mulaney’s absurdist spin on Death of a Salesman. “I think I just love when there’s a really funny idea that’s very creative.” An idiosyncratic sketch like that one, he added, “has a power that’s hard to understand, but it’s there.”\n\nRead: Comedians only care about comedy\n\nThe “funny first” sensibility motivated O’Brien during his many years as a late-night television host. To him, Mulaney, and their ilk, it’s much more important for comedy to be purely, anarchically funny, rather than speaking directly to “the moment.” O’Brien was also being a little coy: His own material can still speak to current events, even if he never trolls for “clapter,” a term Meyers coined to describe the reaction of an audience demonstrating its approval instead of laughing spontaneously. O’Brien still has fun with societal foibles, just in a less direct fashion than some of his contemporaries. Mulaney’s approach to social commentary on his show is even more subtle; sometimes, concentrating a sketch on a character like Willy Loman is enough.\n\nMulaney’s comedic priorities have thus far kept Everybody’s Live focused—or as focused as such a program can be. Take a recent episode about cruises, which featured Ben Stiller, Quinta Brunson, and Mulaney’s frequent comedy partner Nick Kroll, along with a befuddled industry expert named Anne Kalosh. Kalosh sat chuckling as other panelists confessed they’d never been on a cruise and had no real interest in them, while Mulaney rolled with that irony chipperly. And when one caller’s story about life on a boat went on too long, Mulaney hung up on him. “It’s become a yarn, and we don’t have time for yarn,” he explained to his guests. “It’s a little rude, but also, it’s rude to waste the whole globe’s time.” He might be here to hang out, yet he’s still putting on a show.",

    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "Most summers, Old Orchard Beach, Maine, welcomes a lot of Canadian visitors, who typically make up about 40 percent of the coastal town’s tourists. But this year will be different. Since taking office, President Donald Trump and his administration have mocked Canada’s leaders, imposed steep tariffs on its goods, subjected its citizens to more stringent visitor-registration requirements, and threatened its very independence in juvenile ways. All of these moves have, entirely unsurprisingly, made their targets less likely to spend money in the United States. “Canadians are hurt. Canadians are angry,” then–Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month. “We’re going to choose not to go on vacation in Florida or Old Orchard Beach or wherever.”\n\nSure enough, in Old Orchard Beach, an inn owner with a substantial French Canadian clientele recently told CNN that most of his bookings have evaporated since Trump’s inauguration. Meanwhile, demand for flights from Canada to South Florida has fallen 20 percent compared with a year ago, the Miami Herald reported. Hotel owners in South Florida told the newspaper that business is down; Fort Lauderdale’s tourism-marketing agency said it is “deeply concerned” about the effects of potential travel restrictions.\n\nTrump’s insistence on disrupting trade relationships with—and asserting dominance over—even America’s closest international partners is putting the economy at risk, and not just in tourist areas in South Florida and coastal Maine. The president sees other countries as moochers and takers, and he appears to believe that the United States is so powerful and its economy so strong that the rest of the world will simply bow to American demands. But sovereign nations and their citizens can make their own choices, and Canadians aren’t the only ones who bristle at threats and obvious signs of disrespect from the United States.\n\nRead: The angry Canadian\n\nPeople around the world are getting the message that the U.S. resents foreigners who are trying to cross into its territory. Amid Trump’s immigration crackdown, the United Nations recently urged staffers at the organization’s New York headquarters to carry their work ID and copies of their passports and visas. Stories circulate about what the administration calls “enhanced vetting.” News outlets in the U.S. and abroad are reporting anecdotes about foreign nationals who are held for weeks when they try to enter the country.\n\nAfter some of its citizens were detained at the border recently, Germany updated its travel advisory to warn that a U.S. visa or entry waiver does not guarantee admittance. In other words: Buyer beware. Last month, other European democracies similarly revised their guidance to travelers who lawfully visit the U.S. The United Kingdom warns that U.S. officials “set and enforce entry rules strictly” and that travelers could be subject to arrest and detention. Some advisories warn members of the LGBTQ community about increasing hostility in the United States and potential pitfalls awaiting people whose passports record a gender identity different from their birth sex.\n\nThese advisories are vague. They do not instruct anyone not to visit the United States, as they might Iran or North Korea. But they are acknowledging that Trump’s border-enforcement efforts are unpredictable enough to have introduced a new variable in tourism decisions. The Trump administration may claim to be fighting illegal immigration, but in its aggressive roundups it is also making grievous errors. As The Atlantic’s Nick Miroff recently reported, it admitted to deporting one man to a megaprison in El Salvador “because of an administrative error” and insisted that he had no recourse in American courts.\n\nRyan Crow: I’ve seen how ‘America First’ ends\n\nOther democratic nations have an obligation to protect their citizens. We didn’t particularly worry about traveling to the United States before, these countries are warning, but now we do. And we think you should too.\n\nOver the years, the United States has benefited immensely from being a reliable global presence and a welcoming destination with predictable rules and regulations for visitors. That reputation is now in danger, purely because of Trump’s strategy of dumping on other countries. A new study by the research company Tourism Economics is anticipating a 5 percent decline in foreign visits to the United States due to tariff wars and “polarizing Trump Administration rhetoric” and policies. (This study was done before “Liberation Day,” when the president imposed tariffs against almost all countries in the world.)\n\nFor every action the administration takes, other countries will respond according to their own values and the demands of their own domestic politics. “The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over,” Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney, recently warned.\n\nThat’s become all too clear in Old Orchard Beach, where business owners brace for the consequences of Trump’s picking a fight with Canada. Chambers of commerce in tourist towns are scrambling to attract more U.S. visitors. But the tourism season in Maine is short, and the numbers this year are bad.",

    "title": "Why Trump Wants to Control Universities",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nA couple of years ago, the conservative writer Christopher Rufo did a fellowship in Budapest, where, upon his arrival, János Csák, Hungary’s then–minister of culture and innovation, “greeted me with a strong handshake,” Rufo later wrote in an essay about the trip. Hungary’s population is not quite 10 million, and the country is among the poorest in the EU, yet Rufo believed that it had something to teach the U.S. The two countries, according to Rufo, were beset by the same diseases: “the fraying of national culture, entrenched left-wing institutions, and the rejection of sexual difference.” But unlike the U.S., Hungary had a plan. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was using “muscular state policy” to turn the culture back around. Among his major targets were Hungarian universities.\n\nIn this episode, Radio Atlantic host Hanna Rosin talks with the education writer Adam Harris, who believes that Rufo’s essay can help explain the Trump administration’s current attack on universities. Since Donald Trump has taken office, he has threatened to take back hundreds of millions of dollars in government funding from universities, and compiled lists of places that might not be in compliance, for various reasons: They failed to protect Jews on campus. They failed to protect women’s sports. They use “racial preferences and stereotypes” in their programs. The administration’s aim, Harris suggests, is much the same as Orbán’s—not just to dismantle the intellectual elite but also to build a new conservative one that better reflects its cultural values.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nHanna Rosin: Universities are all of a sudden breaking news.\n\nLast week, a video went around showing a man in a navy hoodie approaching a woman in a long, white down coat. It was still pretty cold when the video was shot outside Boston, right near Tufts University. The woman backs away, the guy grabs her hands, and then a few more people approach her from behind.\n\nThe woman’s name is Rümeysa Öztürk, and she’s a graduate student at Tufts University. The people approaching her are federal agents. They arrested her after the State Department revoked her student visa.\n\n[Sound of Rümeysa Öztürk’s arrest]\n\nRosin: Just before that, ICE arrested Palestinian activist and Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil. He’d been a leader of student protests. The administration said that amounted to supporting Hamas.\n\nNews anchor: They claim his student visa was revoked.\n\nRosin: Other students targeted for deportation: a fellow at Georgetown, also arrested.\n\nNews anchor: —detained a grad student from India who was teaching at Georgetown University on a student visa.\n\nRosin: Columbia was threatened with losing $400 million, and then they agreed to some demands. Harvard is now also under review for roughly $9 billion.\n\nThere are dozens more universities on a list, suspected of using racial preferences or of “forcing women to compete with men in sports.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump: Your population doesn’t want men playing in women’s sports, so you better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any federal funding. Maine Governor Janet Mills: See you in court. Trump: Every state—good. I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one.\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic.\n\nThe administration tells one story about its attack on universities: that they’re protecting students against anti-Semitism, protecting traditional women’s sports, going after unfair racial preferences.\n\nBut our guest on the show today says that is just what’s on the surface. Adam Harris, who is a senior fellow at New America and who also covered education for The Atlantic, argues that the administration has a much more ambitious, grander plan. And it starts with a pilgrimage to Hungary.\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: Adam, welcome to the show.\n\nAdam Harris: Thanks for having me.\n\nRosin: Sure. So Adam, about a year before Trump is elected, a conservative activist named Christopher Rufo decamps to Budapest, writes a dispatch called, “Orbán’s War,” referring, of course, to Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán. And it turns out to be kind of a road map in a surprising way for this moment, what we’re seeing politically and particularly with universities. What is Rufo’s argument in that essay?\n\nHarris: Yeah. He argues, effectively, that one of the more significant things and the thing that wasn’t necessarily understood broadly at the time was the way that Orbán undertook this effort to sort of reshape institutions, both publicly and privately, to create a sort of conservative elite.\n\nRosin: Okay. And this came, it seems like, as a revelation to conservative intellectuals—like, because Hungary is not an analogous country, but it seemed like a place that you would pilgrimage to learn things. So what was revelatory about this?\n\nHarris: Yeah. Well, Rufo says that they’re facing some of the same issues that conservatives in the United States are, right? The sort of rejection, as he calls it, of sexual difference, the sort of liberal creep into the more general institutions. And Rufo really finds surprising the ways that Orbán was able to successfully combat that in his creation of that new sort of conservative elite in Hungary.\n\nRosin: It’s interesting because I think of conservatives in this moment of their ascendance as anti-intellectual. This is a slightly different view, where they’re viewing the university as a source of a lot of decline—say, decline of Western civilization. So instead of ignoring it or pushing it away, it sounds like the vision in this essay is, No. Take it back.\n\nHarris: Yeah. It’s sort of: Take it back. Bend it to your own means. Strengthen what they believe are the sort of cultural foundations, right? He talks about family life. He talks about Christian faith. He talks about historical memory. And what a lot of conservatives feel that they’ve lost is that control of historical memory, right? When you think about some of the history curriculums that have been attacked over the last several years, it has been because those curriculums are a sort of fundamental reassessment of the position of some of our most celebrated figures in American public life.\n\nRosin: So it’s actually incredibly ambitious.\n\nHarris: In a lot of ways, yes. We’re only 60-some odd years into the idea of a multicultural democracy, since the Civil Rights Act. And a lot of people feel that we lost something when we moved into that era. And so effectively, some of this is trying to reclaim that visage of that sort of pastoral past that we lost.\n\nRosin: Ah. Okay. Okay. I’m starting to understand how this fits more broadly into “Make America Great” and what the attack on universities is actually about. So we haven’t said yet: Who is Christopher Rufo, and how did these ideas start to spread?\n\nHarris: Yeah, so Christopher Rufo is a conservative activist who around 2020, not long after the murder of George Floyd, started looking into diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. And he started writing a bunch of blog posts and articles that really examined the DEI in several different areas.\n\nHe would pool some of the most jarring examples and sort of use those as a way to indict the entire apparatus that has grown up out of the civil-rights movement. But by September of 2020, some of those articles, some of what he said on TV gets to President Trump during the end of his first term, and that really launches this broader interrogation that we’ve seen since then into diversity principles and sort of these ideas of equity.\n\nRosin: Okay. So it’s diversity principles, but it’s also diversity principles as filtered through universities.\n\nHarris: Yes.\n\nRosin: But it’s essentially creating an intellectual road map of all these executive orders, these things that Trump is putting together—there is a grand idea behind them.\n\nHarris: Yes. There’s a grand idea behind them.\n\nRosin: And as Trump is elected and starting to pick his cabinet, you as an education expert, what did you notice? Like, what did you start to pay attention to in university news?\n\nHarris: Yeah. Well, around December, actually, there was a piece that came out in the Washington Examiner by a conservative education scholar, Max Eden, who argued that Linda McMahon could do a couple of things upon being confirmed as the education secretary in order to overhaul higher education and to ensure that institutions sort of got into line. And one of those things, he argued, was to take a “prize scalp.”\n\nRosin: A “prize scalp.”\n\nHarris: A “prize scalp,” and that’s a quote-unquote. And he said that institution would be Columbia University, that the administration should go after Columbia as hard as it can. If Columbia did not comply, it should remove its Title IV funds. If Columbia did comply, then they should find another way or they could find another way to remove funding from the institution.\n\nAnd so when one of the first institutions to receive a big hit on their funding, $400 million, [was] Columbia, the first thing that came to my mind was, Oh, this is a part of the playbook that they talked about in December.\n\nRosin: So how did Columbia fit into the playbook?\n\nHarris: Yeah. Well, over the last, you know, year and a half, really since October 7, when students started protesting the war in Gaza, Columbia has become the sort of poster child for the ways that higher education is doing things wrong, right?\n\nRosin: Out of control.\n\nHarris: Out of control. You know, The student protestors are controlling the institution. The leadership doesn’t really have a wrangle on its faculty. There were criticisms of the curriculum—all of these things.\n\nAnd Columbia and most Ivy League institutions aren’t necessarily places where people are gonna jump to defend them, right? These are places that have multibillion-dollar endowments. When people say that they don’t trust higher education, they don’t mean their local community college. They don’t mean the public regional down the road. They mean Harvard and Columbia because it seems like an unattainable place where the elites are developed anyway.\n\nAnd so over the last two years, really, you’ve seen these attacks on Columbia and how they’ve handled anti-Semitism on campus. Or you’ve seen attacks on Columbia and what they’re teaching to students. And the imperfect plaintiff nature of Columbia makes it easier to say, Well, everyone has said you’re not handling this well, so let’s go ahead and remove your funding. And it would be one thing if they sort of stopped at Columbia. It would be one thing if they came into office, did a long investigation into what’s going on—because that’s typically what happens, right?\n\nAs someone who’s covered the education department for the last, you know, seven, eight years, anytime you have a Title VI investigation in cases of discrimination, those typically take months, if not years, to complete. And upon their completion, the removal of funds has never really been on the table.\n\nRosin: Okay, so if it didn’t go through the usual process, it didn’t seem to be about what they said it was about. So you, as someone tracking this, what do you think it was about? Like, why remove Columbia’s funding? What was that first move about?\n\nHarris: Yeah. So in that piece that I mentioned from December, the argument was: You remove the funding from Columbia in order to scare other institutions into compliance. And if those institutions don’t immediately comply, then they also know that, Well, I can get my funding taken away too.\n\nWe have seen, now, $150 million [taken] away from Penn within days, right—at least paused at Penn within days—of launching or announcing an investigation. And so, really, these timelines just don’t necessarily comport (1) with the way things are done, but they also don’t comport with a proper or legitimate investigation, given the amount of staff they have now at the Department of Education.\n\nRosin: Okay. So they’re not following the rules of a proper investigation. They’re just trying to get universities to comply. But comply with what?\n\nHarris: Yeah, so there are a couple of various—it was interesting because the administration has gone farther than just saying, Hey. You need to get everything in check. Figure it out, Columbia. They’ve actually given them a list of things that they could do in terms of disciplinary measures for students. They said that one of the academic departments needs to be put under a sort of academic receivership, meaning that someone comes in from outside of the department to serve as the chair and look over their curriculums and things like that.\n\nSo there are these sort of very specific guidelines for what can and cannot be said on campuses. And once you start restricting speech in one manner, that sort of means you can restrict speech in a lot of different spaces. So if you say, Well, you can’t have these pro-Palestinian protests in a specific area, and if you do, then we’re going to take your funding away. There are a lot of things there that are reminiscent of the ways that Southern governors used to say that students at Alabama State couldn’t have sit-ins, otherwise they were going to remove the funding from Alabama State College.\n\nIt’s adjudicating specific behaviors and speech that students are making, which is really a threat to all of the principles of an institution. When an administration can come into an institution and say, You have to do this very specific thing. These are the policies that you have to implement, the principles of shared governance, the principles of academic freedom, the principles of a sort of free system of higher education really go away—and those same principles that are sort of the bedrocks of our democracy, right? The First Amendment is literally about free speech. When those sorts of things go away, it becomes a very dangerous environment that limits what people can say and do.\n\n[Music]\n\nRosin: After the break: the narrowing of the American higher-education system—and who will get left out.\n\n[Break]\n\nRosin: You started out by saying the ultimate vision was building a conservative elite. So is the way you put this entire picture together, is that essentially: You break down, you take away their funding? I mean, now I just sound kind of paranoid and conspiratorial, but maybe this is the plan. Like, you take away funding—in this way, it’s a little confusing, because some of the funding is for science so, you know, it’s not all completely directed. But you take away the funding. You therefore shock the university into stopping behaving the way it has, and then what? What’s the ultimate—I don’t know what happened in Hungary, so—\n\nHarris: Yeah. So that vision that Rufo discussed sort of happened in Hungary, where they’re trying to get back to the cultural traditions, the cultural values that the nation had—those sort of ideas of Christian faith, the ideas of family life. In the same way, it sort of embodies that notion of “Make America Great Again.” And so the question has always been, Well, when exactly was America great?\n\nAnd over the last several years, there has been an argument that has built up in conservative circles that America was better off in terms of these ideas of personal liberty and the freedom of association before the Civil Rights Act was signed, that this sort of administrative state that has built up to enforce the rules of the Civil Rights Act—so you think about things like race-conscious admissions, which was just voted down at the Supreme Court. You think about these reassessments of curriculums, which prior to the 1960s were legally allowed to obscure and/or omit the contributions of African Americans, of Natives, of Mexican Americans.\n\nYou consider the programs that were meant to diversify the workforce more generally—those are some of the programs and things that conservatives are trying to attack in certain ways by saying that they basically discriminate against white people, that it’s reverse discrimination to include those policies, which is why you see a part of this, alongside that $400 million from Columbia, was that broader letter, that “Dear Colleague” letter that said, Hey—if you use race in scholarships, in hiring, in your sort of faculty committees, in your student groups, in any of these things, then we are going to investigate you, and you are going to be in violation of Title VI. And when an institution hears you’re going to be in violation of Title VI, they will start thinking, We’re going to get our funding taken away in the same way that Columbia did.\n\nAnd so this push to eliminate the Department of Education runs alongside this broader push to get higher education under control, right? These are sort of parallel tracks that end up forming a double helix, right? They go right together. It’s like if you’re going to say that you’re going to investigate anti-Semitism with a vigor that no one has ever investigated it with before, and you remove half of the staff at the Office for Civil Rights that actually investigates anti-Semitism, the thing to do wouldn’t be to remove people who are investigating those complaints. The thing would be to beef up that staff so that they didn’t have 20 to 25 cases on their load, so that they could have those five to 10 complaints they were really focusing on.\n\nRosin: Right, because they could find examples of anti-Semitism. They could find examples of other kinds of discrimination. But it’s obviously not what you’re actually after if you’re eliminating the office.\n\nHarris: Exactly.\n\nRosin: You know, as you’re talking, what’s chilling about this is that I do, in fact, associate higher education with the opening of the mind and the broadening of the views. Like, that is what I think university is for. I mean, that is what education in the U.S. does. So it would be a profound shift to think of education as inculcating a very narrow or particular set of content, you know?\n\nHarris: Yes. And you know, it’s interesting. Over the last several years, right, the last couple of decades, actually, there’s been this argument that institutions don’t teach students how to think; they teach students what to think.\n\nRosin: That’s what conservatives say.\n\nHarris: That’s what conservatives say, yeah. It was one of the first things that Betsy DeVos said when she became the education secretary, was that colleges are teaching students what to think as opposed to how to think. And in some ways, this effort is actually trying to do that. It is trying to teach students, This other stuff is out of bounds, right? But this is the acceptable sort of curriculum for your class. These are the acceptable things that you can say. And even if they’re not saying it explicitly, institutions are taking it as such.\n\nWe’ve already seen some colleges, such as High Point University, when that Dear Colleague letter came out that said, Make sure you’re not using race or using discriminatory language in any of these things, they sent out a letter to their faculty, to their staff and said, Remove all of these. They gave them more than 40 words and said, Remove them from everything. Get rid of them in your PowerPoint presentations. Get rid of them in your curriculums. They ended up walking that back. But you see the sort of chill that that already starts to have when administrators are thinking, I don’t want to lose my funding, and so I’m going to go ahead and say, “Let’s just get rid of all of that in our curriculum.”\n\nRosin: Now, the administration created a task force, and there is this growing list of universities that are up for investigation. Is there any criteria? Do you see any pattern in the universities? Because it does seem to include both elite and less elite. You know, big-city schools, small schools. Like, can you detect anything in what they’re looking for?\n\nHarris: So it’s difficult to detect a trend there. There is a way that you can sort of have a veil of legitimacy on any investigation. And so if you have received a complaint from a school of anti-Semitism, you can say that, Okay. That’s going to be the school that we are going to investigate. And knowing that all it took was 14, you know, 15 days for the administration to go ahead and remove all of $400 million of Columbia’s funding, those institutions may be more likely to say, Whoa. Whatever they’re saying for Columbia to do, let’s go ahead and do that—\n\nRosin: So that they won’t come after us.\n\nHarris: —so that they won’t come after us.\n\nRosin: So merely putting a university on the list—and actually, maybe even the arbitrary nature of the list—actually spreads the fear more widely. Maybe this is what I’m realizing now. It’s a very common tactic.\n\nHarris: Exactly.\n\nRosin: If you just put Harvard and Columbia on the list, then other places wouldn’t have to worry about it. But if you spread it far and wide, then everybody follows your orders. Okay. That’s obvious. So I see now very clearly putting the pieces together, putting the bigger picture together of how they’re scaring universities.\n\nI want to know what’s happening inside the universities and how they’re responding. As someone who doesn’t follow higher education as closely, it’s not that clear to me how important this funding is or how reliant universities are on federal funding.\n\nHarris: Yeah. So for an institution that is, say, more tuition dependent, they rely on the students paying their tuition and that tuition helping them to meet payroll. Title IV funding is incredibly important because if you are not allowed to take loans from students, if you’re not allowed to get Pell Grants from students, then a tuition-dependent institution is going to go out of business. For bigger institutions like Columbia, these are institutions that have federal grants from, you know, the NIH, that have federal grants from the Defense Department, that have USDA grants, that have grants from the, you know, Education Department, right? So it’s very varied, and their tentacles are all through the federal government.\n\nThere’s this idea that’s sort of been bubbling up that, Well, these institutions have big endowments. Why don’t you just start using that? There’s a fundamental misunderstanding about endowments. That’s not just, like, fungible money that you can say, Oh, well, that’s $50 billion. We can spend $10 billion and make up for it tomorrow, because most of that money is tied to very specific things. Say a donor made a $400 million donation to the School of Fine Arts: If you start using that for payroll generally, you can guarantee you’re never gonna receive a single dollar ever again, because people can’t trust you to be good stewards or faithful stewards of that money. They can also sue you.\n\nAnd so there are some colleges that, you know, from 30 to 40 percent of their budgets really kind of come from the federal government, but that’s not to say that this is a completely foreign system. There is not a successful higher-education system in the world, really, that is not sort of subsidy driven, that doesn’t receive significant government subsidies.\n\nRosin: That’s interesting. I think of the United States as having a largely private university system and that other, you know—I am always jealous of overseas, how they have more public universities. But I never quite put together that, in fact, there is a strong interdependence between public institutions and universities of all kinds. So now I see why that makes them extremely vulnerable.\n\nI’ve watched university presidents—I mean, it mostly feels like they’re scrambling. You know, Columbia was a probably terrifying example for a lot of college presidents because it does seem that even when university presidents comply or try to comply with Trump orders, they still get punished. Do you see any responses now, like, as you’ve watched, maybe since October 7 and then through Trump’s election? What kinds of discussions are they having about how to handle this situation?\n\nHarris: So there’s been a lot of sort of internal back-and-forth at institutions. You haven’t really seen many public responses, in part because there’s a sort of “keep your head down and hope that it’s not you,” you know, some of the smaller institutions, maybe public institutions. For some of the public state institutions, they’re trying to fight things that are going on in their own states, right?\n\nConsider a place like Ohio, where they have a bill that’s supposed to reform higher education. Florida, Texas, North Carolina, all of these states: There’s this big federal thing that’s going on, but you also have these state reforms, whether that’s to tenure, whether that’s to establish a conservative center on campus, whatever it may be. They’re also thinking about those issues, as well. And so a lot of presidents are in sort of a, Keep your head down. Try to avoid being noticed. And if it’s happening over there, then it’s not happening to us, and we’re already thinking about our budget for the next year, as opposed to a cohesive pushback to say, This is an attack on higher education more broadly rather than these singular institutions.\n\nRosin: And do you think that’s a realistic thing to ask of university presidents? Because it is disheartening to see them fall, one after the other—I mean, both in congressional hearings, in all sorts of ways. And then there’d just be deadly silence. But there’s also silence on the streets. There’s silence in a lot of places. And so I just wonder: Is that a realistic hope?\n\nHarris: It should be.\n\nRosin: You want to hold onto it?\n\nHarris: I do, because we’ve seen institutions in the last few years be pushed into these policies that say they won’t make public statements about political events, right? In Ohio, in that bill, it said that public colleges can’t make statements about partisan or ideological statements outside of celebrations of the United States and the flag—like, really sort of jingoistic, patriotic statements. And pushing back doesn’t have to look like a president being out in the streets, but it does look like reaffirming your institutional principles and living up to your institutional principles, right? Because a principle’s only a principle when it’s tested.\n\nRosin: Right.\n\nHarris: And a belief is only, like—you only actually have a value and make public that value when that value is under attack. And so if higher education doesn’t believe in the principles that it was founded on, then institutional leaders should remain silent. But if they do, then there’s a kind of obligation there. It’s one of the reasons why they get paid so much.\n\nRosin: Whoa. Okay.\n\nHarris: (Laughs.)\n\nRosin: No. I mean, you’re clear. I appreciate it.\n\nJust one final thing: We started by talking about the ultimate goal of this to be the creation of a different kind of elite in the U.S. I wonder if they have a fully fleshed imagination of what a conservative elite would look like and act like and believe. Like, is the end of the vision real?\n\nHarris: I don’t know if it’s a fully fleshed-out view, but they have pointed to certain institutions and said, This is what it could look like. Those institutions are Hillsdale College, the College of the Ozarks.\n\nI actually went to the College of the Ozarks when Pete Hegseth was speaking, and there was this really, you know, sort of telling quote that he gave during his speech that was just like, I went to Harvard. I went to, you know, the Ivy League institution. Those places have lost their way. This is the sort of place that’s doing it right. This is the future. And you look across the student body—it’s majority white and not even, like, a slim majority. It’s students who, when I spoke to them, talked more about the idea of it being a place where they could go and not have to have a ton of loans on the back end of going to college.\n\nBut it was also a place that has—it’s the only college in the country with a vice president of patriotic activities. Every student is required to take a patriotic-education course, where it’s a mix of current events and the founding documents alongside, like, military training. And it’s not a military school. So I don’t know that there’s a fully fleshed-out idea, but I know that there are institutions that they point to as examples of what a college should be, and there are also places that they can point to, like a new college now, and how to make that happen.\n\nRosin: What ended up happening in Hungary, by the way? Has it broadened into a vision beyond that individual college? Do they have a conservative elite?\n\nHarris: In a lot of ways, yes. And if it’s not a sort of fully fleshed-out one to this point, it is much further along than it was when Orbán launched his assault. I think one of the other things that was really interesting about that piece that Rufo wrote was that he talks about the ways that things seemed normal—\n\nRosin: And what did he mean by “normal”?\n\nHarris: By “normal,” he talks about, Oh, people talk about it as if it’s, like, an economic backwater, but, you know, business goes on as usual. But there’s this quiet administrative, instructional war that’s going on in education, sort of reshaping things. And so it’s like, Make everything seem as normal as possible while also launching this assault that transforms the way that a country fundamentally operates.\n\nRosin: And feels and what young minds accept as excellence, basically.\n\nHarris: Exactly.\n\nRosin: Right. Well, Adam, I think the only option after this conversation is to join you in holding out hope that some group of university presidents stand up for what a university is. Thank you so much for helping us understand that.\n\nHarris: Absolutely.

LADA-MOCARSKI is a vice-president of J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation, New York. In 1941 he was commissioned in the Army of the United States and saw overseas service for the Office of Strategic Services in the Middle East, Italy, and France. Colonel Mocarski retired from the Army in 1945 but was in Switzerland on a government mission during the last desperate days of Mussolini. On the day of Il Duce’s hanging in Milan, he crossed into Northern Italy. His chronicle is a brilliant example of history as it was written on the spot.\n\nMUSSOLINI and Claretta Petacci, his mistress, were captured by the Italian Partisans on Friday, April 27, 1945, at Dongo, Province of Como. They were shot the next day on a deserted country road in the hill country above Lake Como. Their bodies, as well as those of several Ministers and other prominent Fascists who were executed on the same day at Dongo, were taken to Milan later in the evening. The next morning, Sunday, April 29, a frenzied crowd hung the bodies by their feet in the public square — the Piazza Loreto.\n\nA few hours later, the bodies were taken down by order of the Committee of National Liberation (CLNAI) in Milan; the city had just been liberated from the Axis troops and was not yet occupied by the Allies. The Committee, originally the underground anti-Fascist “Government ” of Northern Italy, was composed of representatives of all the important Italian political parties. It had attempted to prevent the hanging but had failed because it had insufficient police forces at its disposal. During this attempt fire hoses were turned on the crowd, but they also proved ineffective.\n\nThe population of Milan had been tyrannized and abused for long months by Mussolini and his regime of oppression and torture. Only a short time before, fifteen members of the Resistance had been executed on this very Piazza, which today bears the name “Place of the Fifteen Martyrs.” It is therefore understandable that the people of Milan were taking their pound of flesh.\n\nSince the early days of December, 1944, Cardinal Ildefonso Schuster, Archbishop of Milan, had been considering ways and means to prevent the destruction of Milan and other cities in Lombardy as the war approached its final phase and the Axis armies were being driven back towards the Swiss frontier. The Cardinal finally asked Herr Rahn, the German Ambassador with the Neo-Fascist Government, to communicate to Hitler his fervent hope that the German authorities would not find it necessary to carry out any demolition in the city of Milan or any other important point in Lombardy.\n\nIn February, Mussolini said in one of his speeches that Lombardy would be defended at all costs. In April, soon after the start of the brilliant offensive by the Allied armies, the situation on the Italian front began to look hopeless for the Axis. The Germans were getting desperate and their emissaries were approaching anyone who was likely to have the ear of the CLNAI, in an effort to arrange for a surrender on terms better than “unconditional.” The Committee invariably replied that it would not negotiate unless the Germans accepted beforehand the principle of unconditional surrender. The Fascist Government finally became aware of these efforts; and beginning on April 22, 1945, several important Fascist officials tried to get in touch with the CLNAI. The Committee’s answer was always the same, with the further qualification that it had at least some confidence in the word of a German soldier, while it had none in that of a Fascist dignitary.\n\nCopyright 1945, by The Atlantic Monthly Company, Boston 16, Mass. All rights reserved.\n\nEvents were gradually moving to a climax. On April 24 the Committee had one of its clandestine meetings and decided to call a general strike to begin on the following day.\n\nThe strike broke out in Milan on April 25 as planned, and the workers started occupying the factories. The Germans’ effort to control it was half-hearted as there were several hundred factories to protect — a task which would have split their garrison into many small units, The Committee then decided to start a military revolt on the following day and to occupy public buildings, utilities, and other strategic points.\n\nOn April 25, Cardinal Schuster was told that Mussolini had requested to see him that afternoon because, the intermediary said, Il Duce was willing to sign an unconditional surrender. The Cardinal arranged for the representatives of CLNAI, including General Raffaele Cadorna, Commander-in-Chief of the “Partisans,” the military arm of the Committee, to meet with him and Mussolini. This historic meeting in the Cardinal’s Palace merely showed that Il Duce was not yet ready to surrender unconditionally. After a somewhat heated debate he left the meeting, promising to give a final answer by 8.00 P.M. of that day. Instead, he and the majority of his cabinet fled Milan for an unknown destination.\n\nThe Committee of National Liberation then told the Cardinal that it was taking over the government — the Germans had already offered to surrender unconditionally and the Fascist Government was in flight. Milan fell to the liberation movement without organized fighting. The German troops remained in their billets, and there were only separate encounters with a few isolated Fascist troops. The victorious forces of the CLNAI had only a handful of casualties.\n\n2\n\nIT WAS to Como, near the Swiss border, that Mussolini fled after the unsuccessful conference with Cardinal Schuster. With him went a number of his Ministers, among them Marshal Graziani, and other members of his entourage. Altogether there were perhaps fifteen passenger cars and one or two vehicles carrying several German soldiers armed with machine guns. Graziani had his usual escort of one car carrying armed Italian guards.\n\nMussolini, who was in a foul temper, went to the Prefettura and asked for Signor Celio, Fascist Prefect of Como and head of the Province. Il Duce was incensed at the manner, “unbefitting the Chief of the State,” in which he said he had been treated at the Milan meeting, He asserted it was a low attempt to trick him into accepting something which by its very nature was unacceptable.\n\nAt the Prefettura, Mussolini held conferences with several of his Ministers. At one point Celio remained alone with Il Duce and used the opportunity to obtain consent for the creation of a free hospital zone from Como to Lanzo d’Intelvi. This zone, it was hoped, would be spared from fighting. Celio mentioned that the success of this project depended upon “all important political personages” leaving the territory. Il Duce answered that he understood and fully agreed. Shortly afterwards he said he realized that all was lost. When Celio asked what his immediate plans were, Mussolini answered that he was still undecided. Celio suggested that he should ask Switzerland for asylum. Mussolini said he had been notified that Switzerland would not accept him. Celio suggested that another at tempt be made, using the services of the American Consul in Lugano. Il Duce grew angry and said he would have nothing to do with Switzerland. It was close to midnight by that time.\n\nAt that moment Francesco Barracu came in and told Mussolini that, despite all the efforts, the “small truck” could not be found. Mussolini flew into a rage and worked himself almost into a fit. He was reproaching Barracu and others that no one had taken the trouble to see to it that this truck with its extremely important documents and the woman who rode in it were safely following him on the trip from Milan. At one point he shouted that it was his tragic destiny for the last twenty-five years to have to attend himself to any important matters — otherwise they would not have been taken care of.\n\nPresently Mussolini called for Graziani, presumably to get his advice regarding the military situation and the plans for the immediate future. Celio had tried beforehand to gain Graziani’s support in convincing Mussolini that he should go to Switzerland. Graziani declined, saying he could not take the responsibility for such a step, as he did not believe Switzerland would accept Il Duce. Graziani was worried about his own situation and said he was at a loss to know what to do.\n\nShortly before 2.00 A.M. Mussolini sent for Paolo Porta, Federal Commissary of Como, who was later joined by Paolo Zerbino, Minister of the Interior. They remained in the small drawing room for almost an hour and a half, presumably debating the various possible courses of action for the next day. Celio was not present at this conversation, but his impressions were that the trio examined three alternatives. The first was for Mussolini to go to Switzerland. The second was to continue the fight against the Partisans and, perhaps, the Allied troops. It was presumably in anticipation of such a decision that Graziani and Alessandro Pavolini, Secretary of the Fascist Party, were concentrating the Fascist troops near Como and Lecco. There was no way of knowing, however, whether sufficient troops would rally to Mussolini at that stage to make any effective resistance. The third alternative was for Il Duce to hide himself in a safe place until the Allies overran the hide-out. Celio’s interpretation was that the third alternative was decided upon.\n\nImmediately after these discussions Mussolini decided to go to Menaggio, halfway up the western shore of Lake Como. It was possible that Emilio Castelli, the Fascist boss of Menaggio, convinced his chief, Porta, — and through him Mussolini, — that the country around Menaggio was the best place for such a refuge. Mussolini left the Prefettura at Como for Menaggio about 4.00 A.M. on April 26, evidently having had no sleep since leaving Milan. His entourage knew well that it was a question of only a few days before they would lose control of the situation. They were depressed and apprehensive. While there seems to have been no definite plan of how to meet the situation regarding their personal safety, evidently they were told to keep together and to follow Mussolini wherever he went. It was taken for granted that the wives and families would be handled separately from the husbands and that they would not follow them.\n\nDespite the precarious situation, many Ministers and others near Mussolini continued to feel personal attachment to Il Duce and, to a varying degree, were faithful to him. Many of them would have been willing to risk their lives in order to save him; Zerbino, a relatively recent addition to Mussolini’s high council, was particularly devoted and so were Barracu and Gatti, his private secretary.\n\n3\n\nSHORTLY before eleven o’clock a simply dressed woman, who said she was Mussolini’s maid, appeared at the Prefettura in Como and spoke to Celio. She explained that her husband was driving the small truck which should have followed Il Duce’s car. Evidently it was the vehicle which had caused so much excitement the night before. The maid said that the truck had had engine trouble and that her husband had hidden it on a country road only four or five miles from Milan. She added that they were afraid of some untoward happening and asked for help and an escort to get back to the truck and to bring it to Como. Celio had no soldiers under his command and he therefore telephoned to the local Black Shirts requesting that the necessary assistance be given to the woman.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the news of the strike and disorders in Milan had reached Como and the Black Shirts were afraid to go there, particularly as they were told that the Partisans were roaming the highways and attacking the Fascists. The woman was stranded in Como and evidently spoke freely of her predicament, mentioning the precious load in the truck. Signora Galli, a patriot who was known to the Provincial Committee of Liberation, heard her story and obtained permission from the Committee to go to take possession of Mussolini’s documents for the Committee. She succeeded in reaching the place where the truck was hidden but found that a unit of Communist Partisans was there and had already grabbed the documents. For some reason these Partisans got the impression that Signora Galli was Claretta Petacci’s mother. They completely undressed her and the poor woman hardly got away with her life.\n\nAt Menaggio Mussolini had coffee and slept for a couple of hours in a room on the second floor of the schoolhouse barracks, the headquarters of the Black Shirt Brigade. Shortly after nine o’clock he came downstairs and resumed his interminable conversations with Porta and others. Porta suggested that Mussolini’s motor column, which had increased considerably during the morning with new arrivals from Como, was attracting too much attention and that it should be moved to Grandola, a village a few kilometers from Menaggio on the road to the Swiss border. The convoy moved off by 9.30, leaving no one behind.\n\nOne can readily imagine the fatigue, anxiety, and increasing confusion among Mussolini’s entourage. In Como there had not been enough room for everyone at the Prefettura to spend the night halfway comfortably. Most of the meals were eaten standing up or sitting in the cars. Il Duce’s indecision and interminable conversations about what to do next had a depressing effect on everyone. The wanderings of the motor column gave a pitiful picture of the lack of forethought and planning.\n\nAbout eight o’clock in the evening, without previous advice to Castelli, Mussolini’s convoy returned to Menaggio and went again to the same barracks. Towards midnight Pavolini arrived from Como with two Italian armored cars. Mussolini, Pavolini, and the remaining Ministers again gathered for a long conference which lasted nearly three hours. At 3.00 А.M. Mussolini went to bed, but he slept only one hour. He was up again about 4.00, and at that time Porta gave Castelli the order to prepare the convoy to leave immediately. The chauffeurs were rounded up, and at about 5.00 the motor column headed north.\n\nThere was much confusion that morning prior to the convoy’s departure. Mussolini was calm but the nervousness of the others and the atmosphere of panic were upsetting him. Il Duce shook hands with Celio and the prefect saw him get into the passenger car in which he had arrived. Mussolini was wearing the gray-green uniform of the Italian militia with a matching field cap. Before leaving he put on the overcoat of the same organization. It had no insignia of rank except the red stripe of the “Squadrista,” the distinctive insignia of the Fascists who belonged to the movement from its inception.\n\nOn April 26 and 27, except for a few armored cars and a handful of soldiers, no Fascist troops reached Menaggio to rally to Mussolini’s side. Several trucks of Mussolini’s German guard must have passed through Menaggio on the way north early in the morning of the 27th prior to Il Duce’s departure. Eyewitness reports made by the inhabitants of Acquaseria (a village on the way to Dongo) indicate that two distinct columns met there shortly before 6.00 A.M. on the 27th. There was a reshuffling of cars at that spot. It is probable that part of Mussolini’s German guard met him there and that Claretta Petacci joined Il Duce at that point. It is also probable that at the same time Mussolini donned a German overcoat and helmet and got into one of the German trucks.\n\nDuring the night of April 26-27, when Mussolini was in Menaggio, the CLNAI of Bellagio, a town across the lake, telephoned to Castelli saying that if the Fascist forces in Menaggio were willing to surrender, the Committee would arrange for a representative from Como to come to Castelli under the protection of a white flag. Castelli reported this to Porta, who authorized him to enter into negotiations in order to find out what the general situation was in Como.\n\nAfter Mussolini’s departure Castelli waited for a while; as no one appeared from Como, he and two others went to Cadenabbia to negotiate with the CLNAI there. He reached an agreement for the surrender of his forces, the Partisans consenting that Fascist soldiers should go unmolested, while Castelli and his officials, as well as officers, would place themselves in the hands of the Committee.\n\nThe Fascist edifice was crumbling behind Mussolini as he was fleeing north.\n\n4\n\nTHE 52nd Assault Brigade “Luigi Clerici\" was a part of the Garibaldi Division of the Corpo Volontari della Libertà. During the hard winter spent in the mountains overlooking the western shore of the lake, this “brigade” dwindled to some 15 men. The small size of the unit made it possible for the men to live on the scanty nourishment obtained from friends or sympathizers.\n\n“Pedro” was the commander of the 52nd Brigade, He was a descendant of Florentine nobility and had studied law at the University of Florence. He was just ready to begin to practice when the situation in Italy became impossible and he decided to join the resistance movement. He was in his early twenties and physically not very strong, but he was determined to bring about better days for his country. “Bill,” his right-hand man and subsequently the Political Commissary of the 52nd Brigade, was a young man of simple background. Both men were “real” Partisans as distinguished from “eleventhhour” Partisans — an appellation given to those who actively joined the resistance movement on or after April 26, the day on which the real Partisans came out of hiding and openly attacked the Germans and the Fascists.\n\nTowards the end of April, Pedro’s unit was running short of supplies and the Partisans had not had a smoke for nearly two weeks. Finally they could stand it no longer, and on the morning of April 26, Pedro and 14 or 15 of his men came down to Domaso, where there was no Fascist garrison, and bought some tobacco. While there they heard a radio broadcast saying that the Allies were advancing rapidly from the southeast and that there were units near Brescia. Pedro decided to remain in Domaso, to erect a road block, and to intercept any Fascist or German convoy. No such convoy appeared during the day, but they received intelligence that there were some German troops in the barracks at Gravedona.\n\nBill and several other Partisans went to Gravedona, deposited their arms before entering the barracks, and convinced the Germans that they should lay down their arms. In return the Partisans undertook to allow the Germans free passage within their territory.\n\nThe way south to Menaggio was now clear and the Partisans went on to Dongo and Musso, gaining adherents on the way. They erected another road block at the northern approach to Musso, a few hundred yards south of the small bridge over the Valorba River.\n\nEarly on the morning of April 27, Pedro and his men were at Musso at this northern road block. The block consisted of large rocks and barbed-wire entanglements placed across the main road running on the western shore of the lake. This road was the only avenue of retreat for any German or Fascist formation that might be making its way from Menaggio to the Swiss frontier at Villa di Chiavenna or to Austria.\n\nOn one side of the block were the waters of the lake; on the other, steep hills rose almost perpendicularly. Several Partisans were guarding the road block and the rest were scattered around with a few sentries placed in the hills overlooking the road. The Partisans were armed with rifles, hand grenades, and a few submachine guns. Their fire-power, however, was small.\n\nAbout 6.30 A.M. the sentries in the hills signaled the approach of a large convoy. Shortly afterwards, the convoy arrived near the road block and stopped. An Italian armored car, which led the column, opened machine-gun fire in the direction of the block. The Partisans answered and the fire continued for three or four minutes. Neither the convoy nor the Partisans suffered any casualties, but a workman farther along the road was killed.\n\nSuddenly the convoy hoisted a white flag and the firing ceased. Several German soldiers in the column left their trucks and asked for the Partisan commander. Pedro and Bill, who were near the road, spoke to a German Luftwaffe lieutenant who seemed to be in command of the convoy. The lieutenant proposed that the convoy should be allowed to proceed without molestation; and in return for this permission the Germans would refrain from making any reprisals.\n\nPedro countered by saying that the Germans should first give up their arms and any Italians they might have with them. The German officer said he could not surrender the arms because they were bound for Germany to fight the Allies; he also said that he had no Italians with him. Pedro, since his men were woefully outnumbered, — there were at least 200 Germans with a far superior fire-power, including an armored car carrying a cannon, — was dragging out the negotiations, having in the meantime sent for reinforcements from other Partisan units farther north.\n\nFinally the negotiations came to a standstill. Then Pedro had a happy thought: to tell the German officer that he had no authority to accept such terms and that they would have to go to Morbegno, some 20 miles ahead, to the headquarters of the Garibaldi Division. The German readily consented and Pedro departed with him, leaving Bill in charge. The attitude of the German lieutenant is difficult to understand unless he was misled as to the number of Partisans who were facing him, or unless his men were not prepared to fight.\n\nOn the way, Pedro pointed out small bridges and other obstacles, telling the Germans that they were all mined and ready to be blown up if the Germans attempted to force their passage. This, of course, was a mere invention on Pedro’s part.\n\nIn the meantime additional Partisans were arriving, so that by the time Pedro and the German lieutenant returned to Musso there were almost 100 armed men to oppose the Germans. Nevertheless, the Germans were still stronger, as to both the number of their soldiers and their armament; in addition to the armored car there were twenty-nine trucks with soldiers and eight passenger cars.\n\nWhile Pedro and the German lieutenant were away, the Germans in the convoy left the trucks, spoke with the population, and smoked.\n\nPedro knew that there were no Partisans between Dubino, a village on the way to Morbegno, and Morbegno. He therefore left the German officer in Dubino and went on alone to where “Nicola,” the commander of tlie Garibaldi Division, had his headquarters. Nicola did not have much in the way of additional reinforcements to give Pedro and left it to him to obtain the best possible terms, disarming the Germans if possible.\n\nPedro returned to Dubino and told the German officer that he was authorized to allow the Germans to keep their arms provided they gave up all the Italians in the convoy. The Germans were to submit their vehicles to a search at Dongo, in order that this condition might be carried out.\n\nPedro realized that he did not have enough men to force the Germans to disarm at Dongo. Furthermore the terrain there was not so advantageous as farther up the lake at Ponte del Passo, which the convoy would have to traverse on the way to Chiavenna. The Partisans hoped that they could muster enough people to disarm the Germans there.\n\nThe German lieutenant said that he would have to consult his colleagues. Pedro and the German returned to Musso early in the afternoon. After speaking with others in the convoy, the German lieutenant informed Pedro that he was ready to accept his conditions but that he could not guarantee the behavior of the Italian armored car.\n\n5\n\nTHE German convoy arrived at Dongo about 3.00 P..M. In accordance with Commander Pedro’s instructions, Bill arranged for the search of all the vehicles, distributing this job among several Partisans. The Germans, numbering perhaps 200 men, still had their arms. One could expect a group of this size and fire-power to put up considerable resistance and to impose its will, at least temporarily, on the Partisans, whose armament was much inferior and who, it was reasonable to suppose, were anxious to avoid an out-and-out fight. But the Germans did not want to fight for their Fascist allies, however important they might be.\n\nThere was much excitement in Dongo while the convoy was being searched. The Partisans soon found an Italian Air Corps officer who was wearing a German uniform. They also found a man, two women, and two small children who claimed to be Spanish and who produced Spanish papers showing that they were consular officials proceeding to Switzerland. The man spoke for all of them. In the confusion he produced three passports, one covering himself, another covering his wife, and the third covering them both and issued in the name of Don Juan Munez y Castillo. There was also another passport for the second woman in the car.\n\nThese documents had obviously been hurriedly fabricated; one of them gave 1912 as the date of the man’s birth, the other had 1914. Instead of the usual pressed seal it had a rubber stamp. The children were chattering in Italian and asked who the man was who was interrogating them. When told he was a Partisan, they said that the Partisans were stupid and bad.\n\nThe Spaniards were told that only the Germans could continue the trip and that they would have to remain in Dongo. Someone from the Partisans addressed the pseudo-Spanish consul in Spanish and ascertained that he did not speak the language. The “consul” and his wife were allowed to move into the local hotel, pending the further disposition of their case. The other woman, who later on proved to be Claretta Petacei, Mussolini’s mistress, was taken to the Municipal Building.\n\nBill had just finished searching the second German truck when one of the eleventh-hour Partisans ran up to him saying that he had discovered a very suspicious-looking German in the truck farther down the column. Bill and the Partisan went immediately to this truck and saw a man crouching on the floor with his back against the railing. He wore a German overcoat with raised collar and helmet.\n\nStanding on the ground, Bill reached up and touched the suspect’s back, calling out to him. “Camerata.” The man did not move; Bill then addressed him as “Eccellenza”; still there was no reaction from the man. “Cavaliere Benito Mussolini,” cried Bill, and the man’s back shook. Bill jumped into the truck accompanied by the Partisan.\n\nThe German soldiers who were in the truck when the first search was conducted had got out of the vehicle and were standing around it. One of them said that there was a drunken “Kamerad” lying in the truck and that he should not be bothered. Bill answered that he would see for himself and approached the man he had just spoken to, who was surrounded by a pile of blankets and was still crouching on the floor, holding a submachine gun between his knees. Bill could not see his features, and he unceremoniously removed the German helmet, revealing the well-known bald head of Il Duce.\n\nRealizing that he was recognized, Mussolini stood up and said, “I am not resisting.” Bill took the submachine gun from him and handed it to the Partisan. He then took Mussolini by his left arm while the Partisan took his right arm and the trio were ready to step out of the truck. Bill was expecting the German soldiers to open fire and he thought that his last minute had come. It was not reasonable to assume that the Germans would give up Mussolini so easily. Il Duce told him later that the Germans had been instructed to shoot the minute he was discovered. However, no one lifted a finger in Il Duce’s defense — instead the Germans obligingly lowered the folding steps at the back of the truck and Mussolini with his captors stepped to the ground.\n\nMussolini was obviously dejected but tried to put up a bold front. On the way to the near-by Municipal Building, Bill told Il Duce that he would guarantee his personal safety as long as he was in his custody. Mussolini gave a sigh of relief. A Partisan led the way while Bill followed Il Duce with a drawn revolver. He noticed that Mussolini had an automatic pistol hanging from his belt and he took it away from him.\n\nIl Duce was placed in a big room, on the ground floor of the Municipal Building, on the left-hand side of the main entrance. Upon entering this room, he threw off the German overcoat and exclaimed, “Enough of all things German! They have betrayed me for the second time.” Whether this remark referred to the German escort’s unwillingness to fight it out with the Partisans in order to protect him or whether he had something else in mind is not clear.\n\nA number of armed Partisans were placed in the room to guard Mussolini. He remarked that his captors need not worry as he would not run away. Bill remained with Il Duce for a while, plying him with questions.\n\n“Where is your son Vittorio?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Where is Graziani?”\n\n“I am not sure, but I believe he is in Como; he betrayed me at the last moment and refused to come along.”\n\n“Why were you in a truck when some of your Ministers were riding in an armored car?”\n\nMussolini muttered something again about being betrayed.\n\n6\n\nON THE following day when the arrest of Mussolini and his Ministers became widely known, stories of the circumstances surrounding his capture were circulated in the countryside near-by and in Como and Milan. Almost all of these were untruthful. The newspaper reports were also far from authentic — even the locality in which he was captured was given incorrectly. The few eyewitnesses of the various episodes remained on the spot and there was a general reticence on their part to relate the exact circumstances and the role which they themselves had played.\n\nOne of the widely accepted but incorrect statements was that Mussolini was kicked and generally maltreated when first discovered in the German convoy. A thorough investigation in Musso and Dongo, including frank and friendly conversations with several participants in the capture and with other eyewitnesses, revealed the fact that the behavior of the Partisans and of the local population was restrained and that neither Mussolini nor the other prisoners were exposed to any maltreatment.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the civilian population had almost no direct contact with the prisoners during the little more than twenty-four hours which elapsed from the time of the capture to the execution. The Partisans were a disciplined formation led by Pedro, a man of excellent background, who was obeyed without question by his men. Furthermore it is probable that the instinctive fear of the Fascist authorities with which the entire population was imbued was still strong enough in the minds of the “patriots” to induce in itself sufficient restraint towards their prisoners. The fact that their newly won supremacy was but a few hours old and might be challenged at any moment by the Fascist troops, such as the various Black Shirt divisions stationed only a few miles away, must have exercised considerable influence on their minds.\n\nThe telephone communications between Dongo and Como were interrupted by the Partisans. The Partisan road blocks between Gravedona and Menaggio stopped practically all traffic, as the Partisans were taking no chances of letting any traveler pass from the territory under their control into the surroundings of Como, which were still infested with Fascist formations. It was therefore by a mere chance that the authoritative news of the capture of Mussolini reached the CLNAI in Milan. It happened in the following way.\n\n“Carlo,” commander of one of the small Partisan detachments, had his headquarters at Gera Lario, a village at the northern end of Lake Como. When he heard that a large German-Italian convoy in which Mussolini was traveling had been stopped by the Partisans at Dongo, several miles away, he decided to go there.\n\nTo satisfy himself that Mussolini had really been captured, he went to the Municipal Building and saw Il Duce with his own eyes. Carlo returned to Gera Lario and went to the offices of the Idro Elettrica Comacina, where there was a private line to the company’s headquarters in Milan. At 5.30 P.M. he telephoned Milan and spoke to an engineer of the company, instructing him to communicate to the CLNAI that Mussolini was really captured. An hour later an answer came over the same line with instructions to guard Mussolini carefully, to take every precaution that he should not escape, and in the meantime not to harm him in any way. Carlo communicated these instructions to Commander Pedro and to Bill.\n\n7\n\nEVEN before receiving these instructions, Pedro decided that the location of Dongo on the main road, with its relative proximity to Como and Menaggio, might present an opportunity for a Fascist coup to liberate Mussolini. He therefore decided to move Il Duce to Germasino, a small village in the hills near-by.\n\nThe approach to Germasino is not easy. The road is narrow and has a number of hairpin curves. At a height of about 1900 feet are the barracks of the Guardia di Finanza, a detachment of which was charged with the surveillance of the near-by ItalianSwiss frontier. The Guardia di Finanza as a body had been very sympathetic to the Partisans in their strife against the Fascists. The Germasino detachment lent them arms on several occasions and during the cold winter months they often allowed Pedro’s Partisans to spend the night in their barracks. Many members ol this front ier unit openly went over to the Partisans and served in the ranks of the Garibaldi Division long before the final overthrow of the Fascist regime. The Partisans could therefore count on the discretion and assistance of this particular unit when they were looking for a place to keep Mussolini.\n\nBetween 6.30 and 7.00 P.M. Pedro took Mussolini and Porta from the place of their detention at Dongo and drove them to Germasino, accompanied by a brigadier of the Guardia di Finanza and a fervent patriot. The small car in which they climbed the steep road was followed by a somewhat larger car with eight Partisans as guards; seven more were following on foot and arrived at the barracks in due course.\n\nMussolini was taken into the office on the second floor of the main building, belonging to Antonio Spadea, local commander oh the Guardia di Finanza. While still on the stairs, Pedro asked Mussolini whether he had any special requests to make. Upon entering Spadea’s office, Mussolini took Pedro aside and, in a hushed voice, asked the Partisan chief to do him a great favor. He asked Pedro to tell the lady who was traveling with the Spanish consul and his wife that he was well and that everything seemed to be in order. Pedro asked who the lady was and Mussolini answered that she was a good friend of his. “But who is she?” insisted Pedro.\n\nLa Petacci,” said Mussolini, lowering his voice still further.\n\nLeaving fifteen Partisan guards, mostly eleventhhour recruits, to guard Il Duce, Pedro went back to Dongo. Mussolini must have arrived at Germasino shortly after 7.00 P.M., and Pedro left for Dongo within half an hour.\n\nOn his return to the Municipal Building at Dongo, Pedro spoke alone to Claretta Petacci and told her of Mussolini’s message. Petacci pretended at first not to understand, and expressed surprise that Il Duce should be sending any messages to her. Pedro abruptly said that Mussolini had confided in him and that she might do likewise. Petacci and Pedro then spoke frankly with each other for over an hour. She told him a good deal about her life and her relations with Il Duce. During this recital she cried several times. Evidently she made a decided impression on the young Partisan chief. Before leaving her, he asked her in turn whether she had any requests to make.\n\nPetacci answered that she did not know what the Partisans were planning to do with her, but that she supposed they would release her before long. It was her desire however, she said, to stay with Il Duce even if it meant death, and she begged Pedro to let her join Mussolini wherever he was. Pedro said that he did not see how this could be done at that moment, but he promised to do it later if it was at all possible.\n\nShortly after one o’clock that night (April 28) Pedro returned to Germasino. On arriving at the barracks, he learned that Mussolini had been placed in a cell on the third floor. Il Duce was lying in bed but was not asleep. Pedro told him that he regretted disturbing him, but he had come to move him to another place. Il Duce said he had expected such a move, as he did not think he would be left in Germasino long. He dressed and went to the office on the floor below. Pedro told him that he would have to have his head bandaged in order to prevent possible recognition on the way.\n\nPedro was planning to take Mussolini all the way to Como and he was afraid that some Partisan road block might mistake him for a Fascist liberating Mussolini. There was still a great deal of confusion in the countryside and little coördination between the various Partisan units covering different sectors of the main road to Como. Pedro and Mussolini descended the steep hill road from Germasino to Dongo. Not far from the latter, in a prearranged spot, they met the car with Claretta Petacci, escorted by Captain “Neri,” chief of Pedro’s staff, and “Pietro,” another Partisan.\n\nIn Moltrasio, a few kilometers from Como, Pedro heard a good deal of shooting. It was continuous and strong, indicating a fairly large number of fighters. Pedro and Neri thought that this might be an attempt by some Fascist formations to force their way to Dongo to liberate Mussolini. They decided that it would not be safe to proceed farther and they went into consultation as to where Mussolini and Petacci should be taken. Neri described a house in Bonzanigo di Mezzegra, a remote settlement in the hills above Azzano. He himself had spent many a night in this house, hiding from Fascist pursuit, and he knew the owners, simple country folk, very well, He was absolutely sure of their discretion and loyalty. Everyone agreed that this was a good place and both cars retraced their way to Azzano, some 15 or 20 kilometers distant. Mussolini and Petacci had passed through Azzano on their way to Musso and Dongo, in the German convoy.\n\nBoth on their way to Como and on the return trip, the cars were stopped by the Partisans several times. Pedro and Neri said that they were transporting some wounded Partisans and they were allowed to proceed.\n\n8\n\nAT Azzano, at the intersection of the main road with the country road leading uphill to Bonzanigo, the cars stopped and the passengers all got out. Pedro, Neri, and Pietro escorted Mussolini and Petacci to the house selected as the next abode for them. The party took a short cut, avoiding the main country road. It was uphill going and it was raining. Petacci was very tired, so the party proceeded slowly, arriving at the house of Giacomo de Maria between 2.00 and 3.00 A.M.\n\nThe master of the house was awakened. He readily offered his hospitality to the wounded German couple — that is how Mussolini and Petacci were introduced to him. On entering the dwelling, Mussolini greeted his hosts with “Buona sera.”\n\nThe humble mistress of the house asked for a little time to tidy up the room on the third floor, in which their two sons were sleeping. They were awakened and sent into the mountains to a hut belonging to the family. Pedro asked the woman to use new and clean linen, if possible, and to put the best there was at the disposal of the couple, He added that they might remain for two or three days. The good woman did as she was told, never imagining who her guests were. When the wounded man was offered coffee in the kitchen, he abruptly said he didn’t want it. He generally had a commanding attitude, although he looked old and tired. Shortly afterwards the couple were taken upstairs.\n\nTheir room had one entrance door and a window in the same wall. A double bed was placed parallel to this wall. At the head of the bed hung three cheap religious pictures. Against the opposite wall stood a small iron washstand, while on the wall facing the window hung a discolored photograph of a cousin of the mistress of the house, killed during World War I. Wooden chairs completed the furnishings of this small whitewashed room.\n\nThe couple brought no suitcases or other belongings, except that the woman had a foulard kerchief with a pair of shoes tied in it, and a blue fur-lined cap that tied under the chin. The couple also had with them a gray Italian Army blanket which was placed on the bed when Petacci said that she was cold.\n\nMussolini hardly spoke at all, but did ask for two pillows. Petacci asked for a comb and various other things. In the room upstairs, Mussolini took off his bandages. The peasant owner of the house was in the room at that moment and recognized him, but kept still and said nothing to his wife. The Partisan who was mounting guard in the small hall adjoining the room locked the door from the outside, and two Partisans were left in the house to take turns in guarding Mussolini. Pedro, Neri, Pietro, and the rest departed.\n\nThe couple slept until almost midday (Saturday, April 28). Upon arising, Petacci asked for polenta, a kind of corn meal, and for some milk. Two portions of this were brought up, together with a plate of salami and rationed bread. Petacci ate with appetite; Mussolini took only two slices of salami and some bread. He did not drink the milk, just as the evening before he had refused coffee, and drank some water instead. Was he afraid of being poisoned?\n\nMussolini looked rested and much younger after the night’s sleep. He washed but didn’t shave. He spoke very little and looked sad. To anything that was said to him, he invariably answered “Bene, bene.”\n\nIn the meantime, the inhabitants of the village were much excited because the rumor had spread that in the afternoon of the previous day Mussolini had passed on the main road below. The mistress of the house remained inside the entire morning, but her husband went out, working around the house, and even walked in the village. He never said a word about his guests, whose presence thus remained unknown until the moment of their departure. Someone in the house mentioned the fact that the American troops had reached Como. Opening his door, Mussolini asked whether this was true, and received an affirmative reply. He was visibly moved by the news.\n\nAbout four o’clock, a “Colonel Valerio” and Pietro arrived at the house. Valerio was escorted to the room upstairs by Giacomo, who remained outside. After knocking, Valerio entered the room. From behind the closed door, Giacomo distinctly heard him urging Mussolini and Petacci to leave with him at once. Valerio kept repeating that there was no time to lose. In a few minutes, Il Duce and Petacci left the house. Petacci was leaning on Mussolini’s arm, pale and crying. Mussolini was making a show of boldness and was pulling her with him.\n\nColonel Valerio, representing the CLNAI and General Cadorna, Commander-in-Chief of the Corpo Volontari della Liberià, had arrived in Dongo about one o’clock on Saturday, April 28. He identified himself to Pedro and produced a document stating that he belonged to the Milan Partisan headquarters and was charged with an important mission in the execution of which all Partisan formations were instructed to assist him. He told Pedro that his mission was to execute Mussolini, Petacci, and various Fascist dignitaries. After some hesitation Pedro accepted Valerio as his superior officer, whom he was to assist in carrying out his mission.\n\n9\n\nVALERIO had neither specific written orders nor a list of persons to be executed, a fact which is not surprising since there were no reliable communications between Dongo and Milan and since the Central Committee in Milan did not even know exactly who were in the Partisans’ custody. Valerio therefore asked Pedro for a list of persons and the places of their detention. Such a list, with a grand total of 49 captured at Musso and Dongo, was shown him. It included not only the Ministers and dignitaries but also chauffeurs and others. In addition to Mussolini and Claretta Petacci, Valerio selected sixteen others: Alessandro Pavolini, Francesco Barracu, Paolo Porta, Nicola Bombacci, Vito Casalnuovo, Ernesto Daquanno, Pietro Callistri, Goffredo Coppola, Augusto Liverani, Luigi Gatti, Ruggero Romano, Mario Nudi, Fernando Mezzasoma, Paolo Zerbino, Uttinperger, and Marcello Petacci.\n\nIt was only upon the arrival of Valerio at Dongo that the “Spaniard” who was in the car with Claretta was identified as her brother Marcello. Valerio arrived believing that the person in question was Vittorio Mussolini. As this “Spaniard” continued to deny that he was Vittorio, Colonel Valerio gave orders to Bill to have him taken to the local cemetery and be given three minutes to divulge his identity, failing which he would be shot at once.\n\nMarcello Petacci then told who he was and, when asked for proof, referred to his real documents concealed in the room of the hotel where he had spent the night. The documents were duly found. His name was then added to those who were to be shot.\n\nOn the pretext that he came to “liberate” them, Valerio took Mussolini and Petacci from the house at Bonzanigo about four o’clock. If Duce was wearing an iron-gray overcoat with his collar pulled up and a cap pulled down over his eyes. Claretta Petacci was wearing a simple gray suit and a silk kerchief on her head. Both wore black riding boots. The escort consisted of Colonel Valerio, the Partisan Pietro, and the two Partisans who stood guard during the night. Il Duce and his mistress first walked up the hill on Via del Reale and then took Via Mainoni l’Intignato. Halfway down that street, Mussolini suddenly looked as if he were going to collapse, but he immediately regained his composure. The few people who were on the street at that time were ordered to go away, but there were several persons still tarrying who saw the procession.\n\nVia Mainoni l’Intignato leads to a small piazza in which there is a long stone basin, with constantly running water, the wash place of the village. At the eastern end of the piazza there is an archway which marks the beginning of Via 24 Maggio, which winds down to Azzano, passing through Giulino. Waiting at the entrance to the archway was Valerio’s car. The party stopped there. It was rather dark under the archway and the place would have been fitting for an execution. However, the presence of two persons near-by, and of two others near the wash basin a short distance away, made this site impracticable.\n\nThey got into the car and were driven along Via 24 Maggio, reaching the small settlement of Giulino di Mezzegra and stopping in front of a gate bearing the number 14. At this point, the road turns slightly and nothing on it can be seen from the north. A sharp curve preceding this point in the road conceals the view from the south. Looking down and to the left from the gate, towards the lake, one can see the trees of Tremezzo. Beyond the lake is the country around Bellaggio.\n\nBehind the gate, a short way up, stands the Villa Belmonte, to which gate 14 is the entrance. Among these beautiful surroundings, Valerio made Mussolini and Petacci leave the car, pretending that he heard a suspicious noise which he wanted to investigate. Startled and dumfounded, they heard their death sentence suddenly read to them by the man from Milan. Mussolini was then ordered to move a few paces away towards the stone wall at the northern end of the gate. Almost simultaneously Colonel Valerio’s gun rang out. He was standing somewhat to the side of Mussolini, and his five shots caught Il Duce obliquely in the chest, bringing him to his knees.\n\nIl Duce slumped, first falling to his knees, then leaning sideways against the wall.\n\nIt was then Petacci’s turn — she lifted her arms in a desperate gesture, received several bullets in the chest, and fell by the side of her lover, their bodies touching. The time of the execution must have been between 4.15 and 4.30 P.M.\n\nValerio then returned to Dongo, where he arrived shortly before 5.00 P.M. In the meantime, the prisoners held at Germasino were brought to Dongo. Upon Valerio’s return the preparations for the execution of the sixteen persons previously selected were promptly made.\n\nPadre Acursio Ferrari, a priest from a neighboring monastery, asked Colonel Valerio for permission to give the last rites of the Church to anyone who might wish them. Ministers Romano and Liverani had previously sent word that they would like to receive religious comfort from a priest. Colonel Valerio said that the Padre could have three minutes for that purpose. When the monk remonstrated that this was hardly sufficient time for so many people, Valerio replied that military exigencies did not allow any extension.\n\nAfter receiving absolution “en masse” the prisoners were told to turn around and face the lake. It became obvious that they were to be shot in the back. Barracu then pleaded for the right to face the firing squad because of two gold medals, the highest Italian awards for bravery, he had earned during World War I. Valerio flatly refused this request. The prisoners shouted three times, “Evviva l’Italia!” and the platoon of execution, composed of Valerio’s men from Milan augmented by several local Partisans, opened fire. It was exactly 5.17 P.M. Several prisoners were not killed by the first volley. A few struggled on the ground; one tried to get up. The platoon of execution continued to fire until there was no sign of life. It was all over.\n\nMarcello Petacci was not executed with the rest, although Valerio included him among those to be shot. When he was led out from a separate cell, in which he had been confined, the other prisoners, already assembled in the Piazza, shouted that they would not have him executed with them because they did not want to have the blood of the villain and the spy mix with their own. Valerio yielded to the determined and angry shouting of the prisoners and Petacci was led away.\n\nImmediately thereafter, he was led out again and conducted to the scene of execution. He broke down completely, cried and begged for mercy. Within sight of the corpses of those who had just died, he made a desperate attempt to escape by jumping into the lake. The Partisans opened fire from the shore and he was killed in the water. The body was later retrieved and added to the rest.\n\nA truck took all the bodies from Dongo to Azzano. Mussolini and Petacci were brought down to the same spot from Giulino di Mezzegra. Neither of them lost any blood at the place of execution, but when Mussolini’s body was being placed in a truck at Azzano, it suddenly started bleeding profusely and a large puddle formed on the pavement. The truck with all the bodies then started for Milan.",

    "content": "Recently, I accidentally overdrew my checking account. That hadn’t happened to me in years—the last time was in 2008, when I was running a small business with no safety net in the middle of a financial crisis. Back then, an overdrawn account meant eating canned soup and borrowing cash from friends only slightly better off than me. This time, I didn’t need to worry—I was able to move money from a different account. And yet all the old feelings—heart palpitations, the seizure of reason in my brain—came right back again.\n\nI have one of those wearable devices that monitors my heart rate, sleep quality, activity level, and calories burned. Mine is called an Oura ring, and at the end of the day, it told me what I already knew: I had been “unusually stressed.” When this happens, the device asks you to log the source of your stress. I scrolled through the wide array of options—diarrhea, difficulty concentrating, erectile dysfunction, emergency contraceptives. I could not find “financial issues,” or anything remotely related to money, listed.\n\nAccording to a poll from the American Psychiatric Association, financial issues are the No. 1 cause of anxiety for Americans: 58 percent say they are very or somewhat anxious about money. How, I wondered, was it possible that this had not occurred to a single engineer at Oura?\n\nFor all of the racial, gender, and sexual reckonings that America has undergone over the past decade, we have yet to confront the persistent blindness and stigma around class. When people struggle to understand the backlash against elite universities, or the Democrats’ loss of working-class voters, or the fact that more and more Americans are turning away from mainstream media, this is why.\n\nAmerica is not just suffering from a wealth gap; America has the equivalent of a class apartheid. Our systems—of education, credentialing, hiring, housing, and electing officials—are dominated and managed by members of a “comfort class.” These are people who were born into lives of financial stability. They graduate from college with little to no debt, which enables them to advance in influential but relatively low-wage fields—academia, media, government, or policy work. Many of them rarely interact or engage in a meaningful way with people living in different socioeconomic strata than their own. And their disconnect from the lives of the majority has expanded to such a chasm that their perspective—and authority—may no longer be relevant.\n\nTake, for instance, those lawmakers desperately workshopping messages to working-class folks: More than half of congressional representatives are millionaires. In academia, universities are steered by college presidents—many of whom are paid millions of dollars a year—and governed by boards of trustees made up largely of multimillionaires, corporate CEOs, and multimillionaire corporate CEOs. (I know because I serve on one of these boards.) Once, a working-class college dropout like Jimmy Breslin could stumble into a newsroom and go on to win the Pulitzer Prize; today, there’s a vanishingly small chance he’d make it past security. A 2018 survey of elite newsrooms found that 65 percent of summer interns had attended top-tier colleges.\n\nCollege attainment is more than a matter of educational status; it is also a marker of class comfort. Seventy percent of people who have at least one parent with a bachelor’s degree also have a bachelor’s degree themselves. These graduates out-earn and hold more wealth than their first-generation college peers. At elite schools, about one in seven students comes from a family in the top 1 percent of earners. Graduates of elite colleges comprise the majority of what a study in Nature labeled “extraordinary achievers”: elected officials, Fortune 500 CEOs, Forbes’s “most powerful,” and best-selling authors.\n\nWhat we have is a compounded problem, in which people with generational wealth pull the levers on a society that they don’t understand. Whether corporate policies or social welfare or college financial aid, nearly every aspect of society has been designed by people unfamiliar with not only the experience of living in poverty but the experience of living paycheck to paycheck—a circumstance that, Bank of America data shows, a quarter of Americans know well.\n\nThe dissonance between the way the powerful think and how the rest of America lives is creating a lot of chaos. It can be seen in the rejection of DEI and “woke-ism”—which is about racism, yes, but also about the imposition of the social mores of an elite class. It can be seen above all in the rise of Donald Trump, who won again in part because he—unlike Democrats—didn’t dismiss the “vibecession” but exploited it by addressing what people were feeling: stressed about the price of eggs.\n\nThese phenomena might not be rational. But anxiety isn’t rational. Studies have found that working through a challenging financial time can affect one’s brain as much as missing an entire night’s sleep, or a loss of 13 IQ points. Financial anxiety is linked with higher rates of depression and psychological distress, which can manifest in physical health issues such as heart disease and reduced immune response. The feeling of scarcity can also affect people’s ability to make sound decisions and retain information—not helpful when you can’t afford the late fee on a bill. In short, the haves are literally in a different head space than the have-nots.\n\nExacerbating this problem is widespread class dysmorphia. One reason so many well-off Americans feel capable of opining about less well-off Americans is because they don’t realize that they are, in fact, well-off in the first place. The explosion of the American billionaire class—from 272 individuals in 2001 to 813 in 2024, according to Forbes—has made millionaires feel relatively poor. There are more of them too. The number of Americans worth $30 million or more grew by 7.5 percent in 2023 alone. And still, according to a survey of millionaires done that year, two-thirds of them did not consider themselves wealthy.\n\nHere’s the broader situation: 30 percent of American households are classified by Pew as low income, and 19 percent are upper income. And yet a 2024 Gallup survey found that only 12 percent of Americans identified themselves as “lower class” and just 2 percent as “upper class.” In short: No one wants to be perceived as poor, and no one rich ever feels rich enough.\n\nAs a result, the very term middle class has become a meaningless catchall for a disparate range of lived financial experiences. No wonder so much policy and rhetoric geared toward this group fails to stick. Who are these policies actually for? And what theoretical problems do they aim to address? Those of the third-generation college-educated social worker, whose parents helped her with a down payment on a house? Or those of the first-gen woman with student loans who holds the same job and lives in a rental apartment? Technically they earn the same wage and both likely see themselves as middle class, but they have extremely different lives because only one is a member of the comfort class.\n\nMembers of the comfort class are not necessarily wealthy. Perhaps one day they will earn or inherit sums that will put them in that category. But wealth is not the marker of the comfort class. Security is. An emergency expense—say a $1,200 medical bill—would send most Americans into a fiscal tailspin; for the comfort class, a text to Mom and Dad can render “emergencies” nonexistent.\n\nThis helps explain why the comfort class tends to vote differently. Someone who feels they don’t fundamentally need to worry about money if things go south will be more willing to vote on their values—issues like democratic norms or reproductive rights—than someone whose week-to-week concern is how inflation affects her grocery budget.\n\nMany things drove voters to Trump, including xenophobia, transphobia, and racism. But the feeling that the Democratic Party had been hijacked by the comfort class was one of them. I recently saw—and admittedly laughed at—a meme showing a group of women from The Handmaid’s Tale. The text read: “I know, I know, but I thought he would bring down the price of eggs.”\n\nTo many Americans, classism is the last socially acceptable prejudice. It’s not hard to understand the resentment of a working-class person who sees Democrats as careful to use the right pronouns and acknowledge that we live on stolen Indigenous land while happily mocking people for worrying about putting food on the table.\n\nEven when Americans of different classes are in close proximity, they tend to talk past one another. I still remember, my freshman year of college, coming back to my dorm to discover that my roommate had eaten the leftovers I’d saved from dinner the night before. I flew into a rage, and she had no idea why. She came from a household where leftovers were disposable. From her perspective, all she’d done was have a harmless drunken snack. From my perspective, she’d eaten my next meal, and I couldn’t afford another one.\n\nI move in circles now where everyone’s zip code and alma mater alludes to a homogeneity of experience, but when I start discussing policy or politics with people—be they on the left or the right—I often feel that invisible gap yawn between us.\n\nJust the other day, in honor of Indie Bookstore Day, I was asked to share a childhood memory of an independent bookstore. But I did not have a childhood memory of an independent bookstore. I grew up going to the library because there was no bookstore—independent or otherwise—in my blue-collar Brooklyn neighborhood. I didn’t go to a bookstore until I was a teenager, roaming Manhattan with my friends. For a moment, I felt embarrassed. But then I remembered how much unexamined presumption was behind the question. Most authors come from the comfort class, raised in homes full of books in quaint neighborhoods with local bookstores.\n\nThat’s a harmless example. But in the past eight weeks, life for working-class Americans has deteriorated in real ways. Millions of senior citizens are nail-biting about their Social Security benefits. People are worried for their jobs. The costs of eggs, orange juice, and utilities are on the rise. Mortgages and medical bills need to be paid. Rents will be due. Blood pressures will spike; judgments will be clouded; debts will no doubt be incurred. And the pundits and politicians, on all sides, will watch it from a safe, comfortable distance.",

    "content": "When I joined the conservative movement in the 1980s, there were two types of people: those who cared earnestly about ideas, and those who wanted only to shock the left. The reactionary fringe has won.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nCharles de Gaulle began his war memoirs with this sentence: “All my life I have had a certain idea about France.” Well, all my life I have had a certain idea about America. I have thought of America as a deeply flawed nation that is nonetheless a force for tremendous good in the world. From Abraham Lincoln to Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan and beyond, Americans fought for freedom and human dignity and against tyranny; we promoted democracy, funded the Marshall Plan, and saved millions of people across Africa from HIV and AIDS. When we caused harm—Vietnam, Iraq—it was because of our overconfidence and naivete, not evil intentions.\n\nExplore the May 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nUntil January 20, 2025, I didn’t realize how much of my very identity was built on this faith in my country’s goodness—on the idea that we Americans are partners in a grand and heroic enterprise, that our daily lives are ennobled by service to that cause. Since January 20, as I have watched America behave vilely—toward our friends in Canada and Mexico, toward our friends in Europe, toward the heroes in Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office—I’ve had trouble describing the anguish I’ve experienced. Grief? Shock? Like I’m living through some sort of hallucination? Maybe the best description for what I’m feeling is moral shame: To watch the loss of your nation’s honor is embarrassing and painful.\n\nGeorge Orwell is a useful guide to what we’re witnessing. He understood that it is possible for people to seek power without having any vision of the good. “The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake,” an apparatchik says in 1984. “We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power.” How is power demonstrated? By making others suffer. Orwell’s character continues: “Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation.”\n\nRussell Vought, Donald Trump’s budget director, sounds like he walked straight out of 1984. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains,” he said of federal workers, speaking at an event in 2023. “We want to put them in trauma.”\n\nSince coming back to the White House, Trump has caused suffering among Ukrainians, suffering among immigrants who have lived here for decades, suffering among some of the best people I know. Many of my friends in Washington are evangelical Christians who found their vocation in public service—fighting sex trafficking, serving the world’s poor, protecting America from foreign threats, doing biomedical research to cure disease. They are trying to live lives consistent with the gospel of mercy and love. Trump has devastated their work. He isn’t just declaring war on “wokeness”; he’s declaring war on Christian service—on any kind of service, really.\n\nIf there is an underlying philosophy driving Trump, it is this: Morality is for suckers. The strong do what they want and the weak suffer what they must. This is the logic of bullies everywhere. And if there is a consistent strategy, it is this: Day after day, the administration works to create a world where ruthless people can thrive. That means destroying any institution or arrangement that might check the strongman’s power. The rule of law, domestic or international, restrains power, so it must be eviscerated. Inspectors general, judge advocate general officers, oversight mechanisms, and watchdog agencies are a potential restraint on power, so they must be fired or neutered. The truth itself is a restraint on power, so it must be abandoned. Lying becomes the language of the state.\n\nTrump’s first term was a precondition for his second. His first term gradually eroded norms and acclimatized America to a new sort of regime. This laid the groundwork for his second term, in which he’s making the globe a playground for gangsters.\n\nWe used to live in a world where ideologies clashed, but ideologies don’t seem to matter anymore. The strongman understanding of power is on the march. Power is like money: the more the better. Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the rest of the world’s authoritarians are forming an axis of ruthlessness before our eyes. Trumpism has become a form of nihilism that is devouring everything in its path.\n\nThe pathetic thing is that I didn’t see this coming even though I’ve been living around these people my whole adult life. I joined the conservative movement in the 1980s, when I worked in turn at National Review, The Washington Times, and The Wall Street Journal editorial page. There were two kinds of people in our movement back then, the conservatives and the reactionaries. We conservatives earnestly read Milton Friedman, James Burnham, Whittaker Chambers, and Edmund Burke. The reactionaries just wanted to shock the left. We conservatives oriented our lives around writing for intellectual magazines; the reactionaries were attracted to TV and radio. We were on the political right but had many liberal friends; they had contempt for anyone not on the anti-establishment right. They were not pro-conservative—they were anti-left. I have come to appreciate that this is an important difference.\n\nI should have understood this much sooner, because the reactionaries had revealed their true character as far back as January 1986. A group of progressive students at Dartmouth had erected a shantytown on campus to protest apartheid. One night, a group of 12 students, most of them associated with the right-wing Dartmouth Review, descended on the shanties with sledgehammers and smashed them down.\n\nEven then I was appalled. Apartheid was evil, and worth opposing. A nighttime raid with sledgehammers seemed more Gestapo than Burkean. But conservative intellectuals didn’t take this seriously enough. In large part, I think this was because we looked down on the Dartmouth Review mafia, whose members had included Laura Ingraham and Dinesh D’Souza. Their intellectual standards were so obviously third-rate. I don’t know how to put this politely, but they just seemed creepy—nakedly ambitious in a way that I thought would destroy them in the end.\n\nFrom the December 2024 issue: David Brooks on how the Ivy League broke America\n\nInstead, history has smiled on them. A prominent publisher of right-wing authors once told me that the way to sell conservative books is not to write a good book—it’s to write a book that will offend the left, thereby causing the reactionaries to rally to your side and buy it. That led to books with titles such as The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left, and to Ann Coulter’s entire career. Owning the libs became a lucrative strategy.\n\nOf course, the left made it easy for them. The left really did purge conservatives from universities and other cultural power centers. The left really did valorize a “meritocratic” caste system that privileged the children of the affluent and screwed the working class. The left really did pontificate to their unenlightened moral inferiors on everything from gender to the environment. The left really did create a stifling orthodoxy that stamped out dissent. If you tell half the country that their voices don’t matter, then the voiceless are going to flip over the table.\n\nIt turns out that when you mix narcissism and nihilism, you create an acid that corrodes every belief system it touches.\n\nBut although Trump may have campaigned as a MAGA populist, leveraging this working-class resentment to gain power, he governs as a Palm Beach elitist. Trump and Elon Musk are billionaires who went to the University of Pennsylvania. J. D. Vance went to Yale Law School. Pete Hegseth went to Princeton and Harvard. Vivek Ramaswamy went to Yale and Harvard. Stephen Miller went to Duke. Ted Cruz went to Princeton and Harvard. Many of Musk’s DOGE workers, according to The New York Times, come from elite institutions—Harvard, Princeton, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, Wharton. These are the Vineyard Vines nihilists, the spiritual descendants of the elite bad boys at the Dartmouth Review. This political moment isn’t populists versus elitists; it is, as I’ve written before, like a civil war in a prep school where the sleazy rich kids are taking on the pretentious rich kids.\n\nDerek Thompson: DOGE’s reign of ineptitude\n\nThe MAGA elite rode to power on working-class votes, but—trust me, I know some of them—they don’t care about the working class. Trump and his crew could have taken office with actual plans to make life better for working-class Americans. An administration that cared about the working class would seek to address its problems, such as the fact that the poorest Americans die an average of 10 to 15 years younger than their higher-income counterparts, or that by sixth grade, many of the children in the poorest school districts have fallen four grade levels behind those in the richest. An administration that cared about these people would have offered a bipartisan industrial policy to create working-class jobs.\n\nThese faux populists have no interest in that. Instead of helping workers, they focus on civil war with their left-wing fellow elites. During Trump’s first months in office, one of their highest priorities has been to destroy the places where they think liberal elites work—the scientific community, the foreign-aid community, the Kennedy Center, the Department of Education, universities.\n\nIt turns out that when you mix narcissism and nihilism, you create an acid that corrodes every belief system it touches.\n\nThis Trumpian cocktail has eaten away at Christianity, a faith oriented around the marginalized. Blessed are the meek. Blessed are the poor in spirit. The poor are closer to God than the rich. Again and again, Jesus explicitly renounced worldly power.\n\nRead: Evangelicals made a bad trade\n\nBut if Trumpism has a central tenet, it is untrammeled lust for worldly power. In Trumpian circles, many people ostentatiously identify as Christians but don’t talk about Jesus very much; they have crosses on their chest but Nietzsche in their heart—or, to be more precise, a high-school sophomore’s version of Nietzsche.\n\nTo Nietzsche, all of those Christian pieties about justice, peace, love, and civility are constraints that the weak erect to emasculate the strong. In this view, Nietzscheanism is a morality for winners. It worships the pagan virtues: power, courage, glory, will, self-assertion. The Nietzschean Übermenschen—which Trump and Musk clearly believe themselves to be—offer the promise of domination over those sick sentimentalists who practice compassion.\n\nTwo decades ago, Michael Gerson, a graduate of Wheaton College, a prominent evangelical institution, helped George W. Bush start the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which has saved 25 million lives in Africa and elsewhere. I traveled with Gerson to Namibia, Mozambique, and South Africa, where dying people had recovered and returned to their families, and were leading active lives. It was a proud moment to be an American. Vought—Trump’s budget director, who also graduated from Wheaton—championed the evisceration of PEPFAR, which has now been set in motion by executive order, effectively sentencing thousands to death. Project 2025, of which Vought was a principal architect, helped lay the groundwork for the dismantling of USAID; its gutting appears to have ended a program to supply malaria protection to 53 million people and cut emergency food packages for starving children. Twenty years is a short time in which to have traveled the long moral distance from Gerson to Vought.\n\nFrom the April 2018 issue: Michael Gerson on Trump and the evangelical temptation\n\nTrumpian nihilism has eviscerated conservatism. The people in this administration are not conservatives. They are the opposite of conservatives. Conservatives once believed in steady but incremental reform; Elon Musk believes in rash and instantaneous disruption. Conservatives once believed that moral norms restrain and civilize us, habituating us to virtue; Trumpism trashes moral norms in every direction, riding forward on a tide of adultery, abuse, cruelty, immaturity, grift, and corruption. Conservatives once believed in constitutional government and the Madisonian separation of powers; Trump bulldozes checks and balances, declaiming on social media, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” Reagan promoted democracy abroad because he thought it the political system most consistent with human dignity; the Trump administration couldn’t care less about promoting democracy—or about human dignity.\n\nHow does this end? Will anyone on the right finally stand up to the Trumpian onslaught? Will our institutions withstand the nihilist assault? Is America on the verge of ruin?\n\nIn February, about a month into Trump’s second term, I spoke at a gathering of conservatives in London called the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship. Some of the speakers were pure populist (Vivek Ramaswamy, Mike Johnson, and Nigel Farage). But others were center-right or not neatly ideological (Niall Ferguson, Bishop Robert Barron, and my Atlantic colleague Arthur C. Brooks).\n\nDavid Brooks: Confessions of a Republican exile\n\nIn some ways, it was like the conservative conferences I’ve been attending for decades. I listened to a woman from Senegal talking about trying to make her country’s culture more entrepreneurial. I met the head of a charter school in the Bronx that focuses on character formation. But in other ways, this conference was startlingly different.\n\nIn my own talk, I sympathized with the populist critique of what has gone wrong in Western societies. But I shared with the audience my dark view of President Trump. Unsurprisingly, a large segment of the audience booed vigorously. One man screamed that I was a traitor and stormed out. But many other people cheered. Even in conservative precincts infected by reactionary MAGA-ism, some people are evidently tired of Trumpian brutality.\n\nAs the conference went on, I noticed a contest of metaphors. The true conservatives used metaphors of growth or spiritual recovery. Society is an organism that needs healing, or it is a social fabric that needs to be rewoven. A poet named Joshua Luke Smith said we needed to be the seeds of regrowth, to plant the trees for future generations. His incantation was beatitudinal: “Remember the poor. Remember the poor.”\n\nBut others relied on military metaphors. We are in the midst of civilizational war. “They”—the wokesters, the radical Muslims, the left—are destroying our culture. There were allusions to the final epochal battles in The Lord of the Rings. The implication was that Sauron is leading his Orc hordes to destroy us. We are the heroic remnant. We must crush or be crushed.\n\nThe warriors tend to think people like me are soft and naive. I tend to think they are catastrophizing narcissists. When I look at Trump acolytes, I see a swarm of Neville Chamberlains who think they’re Winston Churchill.\n\nI understand the seductive power of a demagogue who tells you that the people who look down on you are evil. I understand the seductive power of being told that your civilization is on the verge of total collapse, and that everything around you is degeneracy and ruin. This message gives you a kind of terrifying thrill: The stakes are apocalyptic. Your life has meaning and urgency. Everything is broken; let’s burn it all down.\n\nI understand why people who feel alienated would want to follow the leader who speaks about domination and combat, not the one who speaks about healing and cooperation. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve read Edmund Burke or the Gospel of Matthew—it’s still tempting to throw away all of your beliefs to support the leader who promises to be “your retribution.”\n\nAmerica may well enter a period of democratic decay and international isolation. It takes decades to develop strong alliances, and to build the structures and customs of democracy—and only weeks to decimate them, as we’ve now seen. And yet I find myself confident that America will survive this crisis. Many nations, including our own, have gone through worse and bloodier crises and recovered. In Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis, the historian and scientist Jared Diamond provides case studies—Japan in the late 19th century, Finland and Germany after World War II, Indonesia after the 1960s, Chile and Australia during and after the ’70s—of countries that came back stronger after crisis, collapse, or defeat. To these examples, I’d add Britain in the 1830s and ’40s, and the 1980s, and South Korea in the 1980s. Some of these countries (such as Japan) endured war; others (Chile) endured mass torture and “disappearances”; still others (Britain and Australia) endured social decay and national decline. All of them eventually healed and came back.\n\nAmerica itself has already been through numerous periods of rupture and repair. Some people think we’re living through a period of unprecedented tumult, but the Civil War and the Great Depression were much worse. So were the late 1960s—assassinations, riots, a failed war, surging crime rates, a society coming apart. From January 1969 until April 1970, there were 4,330 bombings in the U.S., or about nine a day. But by the 1980s and ’90s—after getting through Watergate, stagflation, and the Carter-era “malaise” of the ’70s—we had recovered. As brutal and disruptive as the tumult of the late 1960s was, it helped the country shake off some of its persistent racism and sexism, and made possible a freer and more individualistic ethos.\n\nBut the most salient historical parallel might be the America of the 1830s. Andrew Jackson is the American president who most resembles Trump—power-hungry, rash, narcissistic, driven by animosity. He was known by his opponents as “King Andrew” for his expansions of executive power. “The man we have made our President has made himself our despot, and the Constitution now lies a heap of ruins at his feet,” Senator Asher Robbins of Rhode Island said. “When the way to his object lies through the Constitution, the Constitution has not the strength of a cobweb to restrain him from breaking through it.” Jackson brazenly defied the Supreme Court on a ruling about Cherokee Nation territory (a defiance, it should be noted, that Vice President Vance has explicitly endorsed). “Though we live under the form of a republic,” Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story wrote, “we are in fact under the absolute rule of a single man.”\n\nBut Jackson made the classic mistake of the populist: He overreached. Fueled by personal hostility toward elites, he destroyed the Second Bank of the United States, an early precursor to the Federal Reserve System, and helped spark an economic depression that ruined the administration of his chosen successor, Martin Van Buren.\n\nIllustration by Ricardo Tomás.

Devoutly anti-authoritarian, the Whigs were a cultural, civic, and political force all at once. They emphasized both traditional morality and progressive improvements. They agitated for prison reform and for keeping the Sabbath, for more women’s participation in politics and for a strong military, for government-funded public schools and for pro-business government policies. They were opposed to Jackson’s monstrous Indian Removal Act, and to the Democratic Party’s reactionary, white-supremacist social vision. Whereas Jacksonian Democrats emphasized negative liberty—get your hands off me—the Whigs, who would turn into the early Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln, emphasized positive liberty, empowering Americans to live bigger, better lives with things such as expanded economic credit, free public education, and stronger legal protections including due process and property rights.\n\nThough we’ve come to call the early-to-mid-19th century the Age of Jackson, the historian Daniel Walker Howe notes that it was not Jackson but the Whigs who created the America we know today. “As economic modernizers, as supporters of strong national government, and as humanitarians more receptive than their rivals to talent regardless of race and gender,” Howe writes, the Whigs “facilitated the transformation of the United States from a collection of parochial agricultural communities into a cosmopolitan nation integrated by commerce, industry, information, and voluntary associations as well as by political ties.” Looking back, Howe concludes, we can see that even though they were not the dominant party of their time, the Whigs “were the party of America’s future.” To begin its recovery from Trumpism, America needs its next Whig moment.\n\nYes, we have reached a point of traumatic rupture. A demagogue has come to power and is ripping everything down. But what’s likely to happen is that the demagogue will start making mistakes, because incompetence is built into the nihilistic project. Nihilists can only destroy, not build. Authoritarian nihilism is inherently stupid. I don’t mean that Trumpists have low IQs. I mean they do things that run directly against their own interests. They are pathologically self-destructive. When you create an administration in which one man has all the power and everybody else has to flatter his voracious ego, stupidity results. Authoritarians are also morally stupid. Humility, prudence, and honesty are not just nice virtues to have—they are practical tools that produce good outcomes. When you replace them with greed, lust, hypocrisy, and dishonesty, terrible things happen.\n\nFrom the September 2023 issue: David Brooks on why Americans are so awful to one another\n\nThe DOGE children are doubtless brilliant in certain ways, but they know as much about government as I know about rocketry. They announced an $8 billion cut to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract—though if they had read their own documents correctly, they would have realized that the cut was less than $8 million. They eliminated workers from the National Nuclear Security Administration, apparently without realizing that this agency controls nuclear security, and had to undo some of those cuts shortly thereafter. Trump seems to be trying to give a bunch of Sam Bankman-Frieds access to America’s nuclear arsenal and IRS records. What could go wrong?\n\nWhen Trump creates an unnecessary crisis, it’s unlikely to be a small one. The proverbial “adults in the room” who contained crises in Trump’s first term are gone. Whatever the second-term crisis—runaway inflation? a global trade war? a cratered economy and plummeting stock market? an out-of-control conflict in China? botched pandemic management? a true hijacking of the Constitution precipitated by defiance of the courts?—it is likely to crater his support and shift historical momentum.\n\nBut although Trumpism’s collapse is a necessary condition for national recovery, it is not a sufficient one. Its demise must be followed by the hard work necessary to achieve true civic and political renewal.\n\nProgress is not always a smooth or merry ride. For a few decades, nations live according to one paradigm. Then it stops working and gets destroyed. When the time comes to build a new paradigm, progressives talk about economic redistribution; conservatives talk about cultural and civic repair. History shows that you need both: Recovery from national crisis demands comprehensive reinvention at all levels of society. If you look back across the centuries, you find that this process requires several interconnected efforts.\n\nFirst, a national shift in values. In the late 19th century, for example, as the country went through the wrenching process of industrialization, America was traumatized by severe recessions and mass urban poverty. In response, social Darwinism gave way to the social-gospel movement. Social Darwinism, associated with thinkers such as Herbert Spencer, valorized survival of the fittest and claimed that the poor are poor because of inferior abilities. The social-gospel movement, associated with theologians such as Walter Rauschenbusch, emphasized the systemic causes of poverty, including the Gilded Age’s concentration of corporate power. By the early 20th century, most mainline Protestant denominations had signed on to the Social Creed of the Churches, which called for, among other things, the abolition of child labor and the creation of disability insurance.\n\nSecond, nations that hang together through crisis have a strong national identity—they return to their roots. They have a leader who replaces the amoralism of the nihilists, or, say, the immorality of slavery, with a strong redefinition of the nation’s moral mission, the way Lincoln redefined America at Gettysburg.\n\nThird, a civic renaissance. After the social gospel took root, Americans in the 1890s and early 1900s launched and participated in a series of social movements and civic organizations: United Way, the NAACP, the Sierra Club, the settlement-house movement, the American Legion.\n\nFourth, a national reassessment. As Jared Diamond notes, nations that turn around don’t catastrophize. Rather, they develop a clear-eyed view of what’s working and not working, and they pursue careful, selective change. According to Diamond’s research, the leaders of successful reform movements also take responsibility for their part in the crisis. For instance, Germany’s leaders accepted responsibility for the country’s Nazi past; Finland’s leaders took responsibility for an unrealistic foreign policy before World War II, when they had to deal with a looming Soviet Union on their border; and Australia’s leaders took responsibility in the 1970s for a political culture and foreign policy that had become overly dependent on Britain.\n\nFifth, a surge of political reform. In 1830s and ’40s Britain—racked by social chaos, bank failures, a severe depression, riots, and crushing wealth inequality—Prime Minister Robert Peel, a leader of great moral rectitude, built the modern police force, reduced tariffs, pushed railway legislation that literally laid the tracks for British industrialization, and helped pass the Factory Act of 1844, which regulated workplaces. In early-20th-century America, Progressives produced a comparable flurry of effective reforms that pulled the country out of its industrialization crisis.\n\nIn the long term, Trumpism is doomed. Power without prudence and humility invariably fails. Then comes the hard work of political renewal.\n\nPart of political reform is an expansion of the circle of power. What that would require in America today is, among other things, a broad effort to include working-class and conservative voices in what have traditionally been cultural bastions of elite progressivism—universities, the nonprofit sector, the civil service, the mainstream media.\n\nDerek Thompson: Abundance can be America’s next political order\n\nFinally, economic expansion. Economic growth can salve many wounds. Pursuing a so-called abundance agenda—a set of policies aimed at reducing government regulation and increasing investment in innovation, and expanding the supply of housing, energy, and health care—is the most promising way to achieve that expansion.\n\nin the long term, Trumpism is doomed. Power without prudence and humility invariably fails. Nations, like people, change not when times are good but in response to pain. At a moment when Trumpism seems to be devouring everything, the temptation is to believe that this time is different.\n\nBut history doesn’t stop moving. Even now, as I travel around the country, I see the forces of repair gathering in neighborhoods and communities. If you’re part of an organization that builds trust across class, you’re fighting Trumpism. If you’re a Democrat jettisoning insular faculty-lounge progressivism in favor of a Whig-like working-class abundance agenda, you’re fighting Trumpism. If you are standing up for a moral code of tolerance and pluralism that can hold America together, you’re fighting Trumpism.\n\nOver time, changes in values lead to changes in relationships, which lead to changes in civic life, which eventually lead to changes in policy and then in the general trajectory of the nation. It starts slow, but as the Book of Job says, the sparks will fly upward.",

    "title": "What a Microscopic Creature Taught Me About Parenting",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "One evening earlier this year, I came downstairs after putting our 4-year-old daughter to bed to find my husband looking at a series of maps of the United States, each showing possible futures given different climate-change projections. In one, my home states of Oklahoma and Nebraska succumb to intense heat; growing crops gets harder. In another, wildfires seem to consume the West. In the Northeast, sea levels rise. Everywhere, average temperatures skyrocket. In Vermont, where I now live, the maps imply that we will still have precious rainfall—and that catastrophic floods will continue.\n\n“Want to watch Netflix?” I said.\n\nThe article was adapted from Chelsea Steinauer-Scudder’s book, Mother, Creature, Kin: What We Learn From Nature’s Mothers in a Time of Unraveling.\n\nIt’s not that I don’t care about these predictions of doom. But I admit that my initial response—as the United States has (again) moved to exit the Paris climate agreement, as the protections of the Endangered Species Act are threatened, as the way is cleared for drilling in the Arctic—is to succumb to the temptation of apathy. It’s all too much, I think. I find myself bewildered over how best to respond to these crises—and how to reconcile our daughter, peacefully asleep upstairs, with a burning world that is widely expected to keep burning.\n\nMy day-to-day parenting to-do list often goes something like: clean up endlessly after an enthusiastic tornado of a child; work toward a condition that, sometimes, resembles financial security; raise my child to be a decent adult; brace myself for the overwhelm that comes with the pressure I feel to help save a planet in the grips of the sixth extinction.\n\nIn my climate-related dread, I know I’m not alone—even though the surgeon general’s report last year about the extreme anxiety coloring the experience of growing numbers of U.S. parents doesn’t mention climate change in the list of concerns causing rampant stress, guilt, and shame among caregivers. Nearly two-thirds of Americans are worried about climate change and feel a personal responsibility to do something about it. Yet when I speak with my climate-conscious friends, family, and fellow mothers, everyone seems to be straining to find agency and purpose.\n\nRead: The concession to climate change I will not make\n\nRaising young children tethers people firmly to the now—to a sometimes joyful, sometimes harrowing, often mundane and narrow world. (As Bluey’s dad laments while carrying a laundry basket in one episode of the eponymous TV show: “This never ends!”) But global climate change tugs many parents’ attention and energy outward—to frightening events and uncertain futures, both of which can feel paralyzing.\n\nI can read scientific papers and the latest United Nations climate reports; I can watch Los Angeles burn. But how do I understand what I’m supposed to do, with my hands?\n\nLately, to answer that question, I’ve been turning to tiny worlds for help.\n\nI received a microscope for Christmas, and I’ve been disappearing into the preset slides it came with: onion skin (staggered oblong blocks with a dark dot, a nucleus, held in each); a smear of human blood (thousands of scattered discs); a splice of rabbit spinal cord (a spongy oval, misshapen beads around its perimeter). Here, among these orderly universes mere millimeters wide, I find I can breathe.\n\nMy husband gave me the microscope, aware of my growing obsession with the small—an interest sparked by my introduction to foraminifera (forams for short), single-celled organisms of an ancient order of protist, which number in the thousands of species. These organisms have inhabited marine ecosystems for more than 540 million years, surviving numerous mass-extinction events.\n\nI first learned about forams when I was researching sea-level rise in Maine’s salt marshes. Forams inhabit almost all marine environments, from deepest water to shore. Perhaps the first record of them in the human canon dates to the fifth century B.C.E., in Herodotus’s Histories, when he makes note of shell-like fossils embedded in the limestone blocks of the Egyptian pyramids.\n\nAs their longevity indicates, forams are incredibly adaptable and resilient. They build their shells, called “tests,” around themselves, some by collecting minerals from the surrounding waters and cementing them together. The shelters, most of them between half a millimeter and one millimeter long, are single- or multichambered, and shaped like a tube or a sphere, a spiral or a whorl. If you search for an image of a foram, you might see one that looks like a rudimentary shell with a series of ethereal lines shining around it like the sun’s corona. These are pseudopodia, or rhizopodia (rhizo meaning “root”), and are made up of cytoplasm; forams extend and retract these cytoplasmic threads as needed for moving, feeding, and constructing their shells.\n\nDo I digress?\n\nFor me, forams were not a digression, but a revelation. Because, listen: Many species of foram are highly site-specific; they evolved within a narrow set of conditions, such as the temperature and oxygen content of the water and the mineral makeup of the surrounding sediments. These site conditions are not preferences but nonnegotiable bounds of survival. The more closely I looked at forams, the more I realized that they might have lessons to impart to humans about our physical place in a changing world.\n\nVann R. Newkirk II: What America owes the planet\n\nThe forams’ shells keep the fossil record. When the cell dies, the shell remains. The shape and structural content of these shells, as determined by their immediate surroundings, gives precise information about the environments that they exist in today, or that existed millennia ago. Their fossils are snapshots: miniature witnessings of a particular place and moment of transformation. It is thanks to this place-bound existence that forams have contributed to our understanding of massive, global change over eons.\n\nForam-fossil-informed discoveries include: changes in sea levels during the Carboniferous period (more than 300 million years ago), fluctuations in the oxygen content of the oceans during the Jurassic (roughly 201 million to 145 million years ago), and glacial activity during the Quaternary (beginning about 2.5 million years ago). The fossils tell us about present-day conditions as well. On a slide under a microscope, scientists can read the work of those tiny cytoplasmic arms. Perhaps a shell has been partly dissolved by acid in an industrial waterway, or is deformed by an encounter with pollutants. As Pratul Kumar Saraswati, an earth sciences professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai, wrote: “Foraminifera is both the clock and the recorder of the Earth’s history. It has played a crucial role in developing our understanding of the evolution of life and the environment on Earth.”\n\nPulling myself back to the human-scale world, I lift my eyes and look out the window with a new clarity. I think of the river down the street that flooded about a decade ago; the summers of record-breaking heat; the shifting composition of birdsong in the trees; the human community, in all its messy complexity. From this site-specific view, I don’t long for escape. Foraminifera have helped me remember that I, too, am tiny and fleeting. The conditions of my physical existence are narrow. This river valley defines my visible horizon. I breathe oxygen made by these trees. And with that remembrance, I feel a wave of relief. This is a world I can touch—a scope I can manage.\n\nRead: A plan to cool off the hottest neighborhoods\n\nThe benefits of local, place-based conservation and environmental work are well documented. The restorative power of maintaining a close relationship to nature is demonstrated as well: Forest bathing, for one—from the Japanese practice of shinrin-yoku, in which mindful, sensory immersion in forests is a therapeutic exercise—has been shown to reduce stress and alleviate symptoms of depression.\n\nBut I suppose what I’ve been seeking goes beyond even this. Like the foraminifera building their shells, I want to construct something for myself and my family. As the scientist and author Robin Wall Kimmerer, an enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, writes in Braiding Sweetgrass:\n\nBeing naturalized to place means to live as if this is the land that feeds you, as if these are the streams from which you drink, that build your body and fill your spirit. To become naturalized is to know that your ancestors lie in this ground. Here you will give your gifts and meet your responsibilities. To become naturalized is to live as if your children’s future matters, to take care of the land as if our lives and the lives of all our relatives depend on it. Because they do.\n\nThe very small reminds me that I exist within limits, within constraints, within particular environments and communities and moments in time. From this narrow space, I can find expanded agency with which to act, and with which to parent.\n\nSo this past winter, I paid attention to the northern cardinal that sang at dawn. I began reading my daughter her first chapter books. I also began the process of getting my prescribed-fire certification, hoping to help with local ecosystem restoration. This spring, my daughter and I will pull invasive knotweed from our yard, and we’ll plant the wildflower seeds we collected late last summer. When the weather turns warmer, I’ll take her to swim in the river. Through these acts, I can construct the foundation of a worldview. I can extend my arms to what I can touch and taste. I can practice building a structure, a house—a home—where caring for my daughter and caring for the planet are not two separate things.",

    "title": "The Cabinet Secretary Who Wants His Cookies Freshly Baked",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
    "content": "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum likes chocolate-chip cookies—preferably freshly baked and still warm.\n\nThis peculiar fact became the talk of the Department of the Interior in recent weeks after his chief of staff, JoDee Hanson, made an unusual request of the political appointees in his office: Learn to regularly bake cookies for Burgum and his guests, using the industrial ovens at the department headquarters.\n\nThat request was not the only move by his team that has alarmed some Interior officials. Four people familiar with Burgum’s leadership, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told The Atlantic that Burgum was focused on his status as the leader of a minor Cabinet department and that those who ran his office repeatedly made unusual demands to his employees. His office leadership once instructed political appointees to act as servers for a multicourse meal. They also dispatched a U.S. Park Police helicopter for his personal transportation. On at least one occasion, a political appointee was told to remake the cookies because the batch was subpar, according to three people.\n\nSome of the concerns have been elevated to senior White House officials, according to the sources. One person familiar with the behavior described Burgum as “Doug the diva.” Three people said the concerns have been widely discussed among lower-level staff at the Department of the Interior. Two people said political appointees in Burgum’s office have been seen crying because of the demands placed on them.\n\n“These pathetic smears are from unnamed cowards who don’t know Doug Burgum and are trying to stop President Trump’s Energy Dominance agenda,” Interior spokesperson Katie Martin told us in a statement. “Everyone knows Secretary Burgum always leads with gratitude and is humbly working with President Trump.”\n\nTwo Interior Department officials, speaking anonymously to push back on what they say are false claims, said the cookies—which are made from store-bought, premade dough and served to guests and staff in a basket—are simply part of the hospitality the department offers to visitors. The helicopter trip, they said, was arranged by his security detail. One of these officials also pointed out that most of these complaints are from the early days of the administration, when the office was still ramping up and few political appointees were on staff.\n\n“He’s not demanding cookies, he’s not demanding a helicopter,” an Interior Department official told us in response. “It is antithetical to diva behavior.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Anna Kelly similarly dismissed any concern when asked for a comment on this story. “Only The Atlantic could spin baking warm cookies for guests as a bad thing. Cold-hearted people!” she wrote to us in a statement. “Secretary Burgum is doing an outstanding job leading the Department of Interior.”\n\nBurgum is not the first Trump Cabinet secretary to spark controversy inside a federal department for the way the secretary’s office is run. During Trump’s first term, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in 2018 amid at least a dozen federal investigations that included claims that he was overspending on travel and tasking federal workers to do personal work. Former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was investigated after emails surfaced showing a federal worker had been tasked with sending Christmas ornaments to her family. And congressional Republicans investigated reports that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke planned to spend $139,000 on replacement doors for his office. He later testified that the final cost was $75,000, and that the high price was required because of the historic nature of the building.\n\nBefore entering politics, Burgum was a successful businessman, amassing a net worth above $100 million. The former North Dakota governor nearly got the nod last summer to be Trump’s running mate, ending up on Trump’s list of three finalists. When Trump won, he was hoping for a high-profile role, such as secretary of state. Trump appointed Burgum instead to Interior, also naming him to the National Security Council at the White House and to be chair of the newly formed National Energy Dominance Council.\n\nLarger Cabinet agencies typically come with more perks for senior officials, like multiple food-service options and government aircraft for official travel. That is not the case at the Department of the Interior, which manages the National Park Service and about one-fifth of America’s land, as well as the federal government’s relationship with Indian tribes. The only restaurant at the C Street headquarters, Bison Bistro, closed during the coronavirus pandemic and has not reopened. Burgum’s Democratic predecessor, Deb Haaland, was known to periodically walk across the street to the Met Cafe for its buffet lunch.\n\nShortly after his confirmation, Burgum had breakfast with Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the Treasury headquarters next to the White House, according to three people briefed on the events. Treasury has a dedicated wait staff that can serve multicourse meals for the secretary and his guests in a private room, according to a former Treasury official. One departmental dining space, known as the “small conference room,” displays the silverware of Alexander Hamilton, the nation’s first Treasury secretary.\n\nDays after the breakfast, on February 11, Burgum’s office instructed four political appointees in the Office of the Secretary, who have no formal role in food service, to stage a similar, multicourse lunch for a meeting with Wright and Mark Christie, the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. His office ordered catered food, and the political appointees plated it into multiple serving courses and washed the dishes afterward. Concerns about the use of political appointees—who are supposed to be helping to run the department—to serve food to the secretary later reached the White House, two people said.\n\nThe two Interior Department officials said that because the department has no cafeteria, staff will help serve food if Burgum has guests over. Burgum’s meal with Wright and Christie was not elaborate, they said—salad, lasagna, and dessert. “We’re talking three plates, three forks,” one of the officials said, adding that it was the only time Burgum hosted lunch at the department.\n\nOn February 7, Burgum’s office ordered Eagle One, a U.S. Park Police helicopter stationed in Anacostia Park, to land at polo fields near the National Mall to transport him to Andrews Air Force Base, where he was scheduled to meet President Trump and fly on Air Force One to Florida for the weekend. The eight-minute helicopter flight from Washington to Andrews is a standard privilege for presidents, who have their own helicopter fleet maintained by the U.S. Marines. Interior secretaries typically endure the 30-to-40-minute drive to Andrews.\n\nThe Aviation Unit of the U.S. Park Police, a division of the Department of the Interior, does not routinely handle VIP transport, according to a U.S. Park Police fact sheet. The blue-and-white helicopters launch to provide additional aerial surveillance during presidential and other dignitary movements, and are used for “medevac, search and rescue, high-risk prisoner transport,” and to support for law-enforcement operations.\n\nInterior travel guidelines state that “oﬃcial travel to give speeches, attend conferences or meetings, or make routine site visits” is not an acceptable justification for “mission requirement” travel in government aircraft. There is a separate category of “required use travel” that allows officials to use government aircraft for “certain specific communications, security and exceptional scheduling requirements.” Separate federal regulations require written permission from a senior legal officer for such travel.\n\nA person briefed on Burgum’s use of the Park Police helicopter said the aircraft was requested by the secretary’s security team after concerns were raised that he might not make the Air Force One departure time after a meeting at the White House. Burgum had nothing to do with the decision to use the helicopter, that person said.\n\n“The Secretary was slated to staff the President of the United States for a trip over the Gulf of America,” Martin told us in a statement. “When it was clear that afternoon D.C. traffic would not allow him to travel by vehicle, the decision was made to take a helicopter to ensure he arrived at Andrews on time to staff President Trump, which is a core mission of the Secretary of the Interior.”\n\nBurgum, the two Interior Department officials added, regularly flies coach. Last Thursday, for instance, he flew on American Airlines to a fracking event in Washington County, Pennsylvania, in coach—the sort of commercial travel that is more typical, both said.\n\nWhite House pool reports on February 7 described Trump arriving at 3:47 p.m. at Andrews and departing on Air Force One with Burgum on board shortly afterward. FlightAware, a company that tracks aviation movement, has no record of U.S. Park Police helicopters traveling in the Washington area on that day. But CopterSpotter, a website for the public to upload photos of helicopters they see in the Washington area, has a photograph of one of the Park Police helicopters flying near the Washington Monument at 3 p.m., shortly before Trump left the White House in his own helicopter.\n\nAndrew Logan, an audio engineer who runs CopterSpotter and the website Helicopters of D.C., said that federal helicopters have the ability to turn off their outgoing GPS transponders, which might explain why FlightAware did not record the February 7 flight. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the Republican chair of the Commerce Committee, has been pushing federal aircraft in the D.C. region to more frequently display their transponder location after a January 29 crash between an Army helicopter not operating its transponder and a regional jet killed 67 people at Reagan National Airport.\n\nHanson, Burgum’s chief of staff, has told federal workers in Burgum’s office that the tradition of staff baking cookies began when he was governor of North Dakota, according to two people. She has worked for Burgum for decades, starting at his former company, Great Plains Software, before moving up to become a senior adviser to his gubernatorial campaign and the chief administrative officer for the state of North Dakota, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nBurgum has also used the political appointees in his department for another purpose in recent days: stacking firewood in his office’s fireplace. At times, he has instructed his staff on the finer points of arranging logs so they won’t collapse and create noise when burning during meetings. An Interior Department official said many people in the department—from Burgum himself to the most junior staff—have helped make fires, and that if Burgum ever offered tips, it was not intended imperiously. Burgum, who worked as a chimney sweep in college, was likely just trying to be helpful, the official said.\n\nBurgum has made some other peculiar requests of his staff. One standing request, described by two people, is that the labels get removed from water bottles before they are delivered to him. An Interior Department official said they remove the labels to avoid branding issues, especially when sharing photos on social media.\n\nNot everyone who has worked for Burgum is concerned about the way he treats his staff. When an adviser close to Burgum over the past several years became aware of this story on Saturday evening, he proactively called us to say that, in the many hours he’s spent with Burgum, he has never seen him behave in an arrogant way. Burgum, this person told us, always carries his own bag and often replaces I in speeches with we in order to emphasize his team.\n\nHe so frequently begins meetings by expressing his gratitude for his staff or other people in the room that it’s become a running joke among his aides.\n\nBurgum, this adviser said, is “the ultimate team guy who has a history of promoting young people,” dating back to his time at Great Plains Software.",

    "content": "Tamara Keith, National Public Radio:\n\nWell, so as we know, President Trump announced this on Wednesday. Even based on public statements, we know that a decision had not been finalized as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSo this was not a well-planned rollout. Since then, there's been a lot of reacting. But there are a couple of underlying and also conflicting messages. One is this idea that President Trump is this great dealmaker and somehow he's going to get deals. Today, he put more of that out into the bloodstream.\n\nHe had Prime Minister Netanyahu in the Oval Office and talked about the things that Netanyahu was going to do for the United States. He's talking about talking to Japan and other countries and everybody wants a deal. Then, at the same time, he is also saying that he doesn't want to give time for deals to take place. He wants these tariffs in place now.\n\nHe's saying that the U.S. — this is a great opportunity for the U.S. to reset the table on the global economy and global trade and that it's going to be painful, but he's the man who can take the pain.\n\nNow, there's pain to go around; 62 percent of Americans have some money in the stock market either directly or indirectly. And I think that's sort of the political challenge that the president faces. Because he's taking all the positions, it's not clear exactly where this is going. It's not clear to the markets where this is going.\n\nAnd so far, there hasn't been sort of a moment where the president sits down with the American people and says, OK, this is our policy. There are going to be sacrifices. I understand that. You need to understand that. We all need to come together as Americans and accept these sacrifices, which in theory is what would have to happen for him to weather what could be months or years of turmoil.",

    "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
    "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks careened through a manic Monday after President Donald Trump threatened to crank his tariffs higher, despite a stunning display showing how dearly Wall Street wants him to do the opposite.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent at the end of a day full of heart-racing reversals as battered financial markets try to figure out what Trump’s ultimate goal is for his trade war. If it’s to get other countries to agree to trade deals, he could lower his tariffs and avoid a possible recession. But if it’s to remake the economy and stick with tariffs for the long haul, stock prices may need to fall further.\n\nREAD MORE: Nations debate response to U.S. trade war as global markets roiled\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 349 points, or 0.9 percent, and the Nasdaq composite edged up by 0.1 percent.\n\nAll three indexes started the day sharply lower, and the Dow plunged as many as 1,700 points following even worse losses elsewhere in the world. But it suddenly surged to a gain of nearly 900 points in the late morning. The S&P 500, meanwhile, went from a loss of 4.7 percent to a leap of 3.4 percent, which would have been its biggest jump in years.\n\nThe sudden rise followed a false rumor that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs, one that a White House account on X quickly labeled as “fake news.” That a rumor could move trillions of dollars’ worth of investments shows how much investors are hoping to see signs that Trump may let up on tariffs.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump tells Americans to be patient as global markets keep dropping over tariffs\n\nStocks quickly turned back down, and shortly afterward, Trump dug in further and said he may raise tariffs more against China after the world’s second-largest economy retaliated last week with its own set of tariffs on U.S. products.\n\nIt’s a slap in the face to Wall Street because it suggests Trump may not care how much pain he inflicts on the market. Many professional investors had long thought that a president who used to crow about records reached under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent the Dow reeling.\n\nOn Sunday Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wasn’t concerned about a sell-off and that “sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”\n\nTrump has given several reasons for his stiff tariffs, including to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, which is a process that could take years. Trump on Sunday said he wanted to bring down the numbers for how much more the United States imports from other countries versus how much it sends to them.\n\nWATCH: Trump compares tariff policy to ‘medicine’ as market futures crash\n\nIndexes nevertheless did keep swinging between losses and gains Monday after Trump’s latest tariff threat, in part because hope still remains in markets that negotiations may still come.\n\n“We’re not calling the all-clear at all, but when you have this type of volatility in the market, of course you’re going to have back and forth” in markets not just day to day but also hour to hour, said Nate Thooft, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management.\n\n“We’re all waiting for the next bit of information,” he said. “Literally a Truth Social tweet or an announcement of some sort about real negotiations could dramatically move this market. This is the world we live in right now.”\n\nAll that seemed certain Monday was the financial pain hammering investments around the world for a third day after Trump announced tariffs in his “Liberation Day.”\n\nStocks in Hong Kong plunged 13.2 percent for their worst day since 1997. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil dipped below $60 during the morning for the first time since 2021, hurt by worries that a global economy weakened by trade barriers will burn less fuel. Bitcoin sank below $79,000, down from its record above $100,000 set in January, after holding steadier than other markets last week.\n\nTrump’s tariffs are an attack on the globalization that’s remade the world’s economy, which helped bring down prices for products on the shelves of U.S. stores but also caused production jobs to leave for other countries.\n\nIt also adds pressure on the Federal Reserve. Investors have become nearly conditioned to expect the central bank to swoop in as a hero by slashing interest rates to protect the economy during every downturn. But the Fed may have less freedom to act this time around because inflation remains higher than the Fed would like. And while lower interest rates can goose the economy, they can also put upward pressure on inflation.\n\n“The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, wrote in his annual letter to shareholders Monday. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.”\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields rallied to recover some of their sharp drops from earlier weeks. Some of the big move may have been because of reduced expectations for cuts to interest rates by the Fed. Some analysts also said it could be due to investors outside of the United States wanting to pare their U.S. investments.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.20 percent from 4.01 percent late Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, the S&P 500 briefly fell more than 20 percent below its record set less than two months ago. If it finishes a day below that bar, it would be a big enough drop that Wall Street has a name for it. A “bear market” signifies a downturn that’s moved beyond a run-of-the-mill 10 percent drop, which happens every year or so, and has graduated into something more vicious.\n\nThe S&P 500, which sits at the heart of many investors’ 401(k) accounts, is coming off its worst week since COVID began crashing the global economy in March 2020.\n\nAll told, the index fell 11.83 points Monday to 5,062.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 349.26 to 37,965.60, and the Nasdaq composite added 15.48 to 15,603.26.\n\nKurtenbach reported from Bangkok. McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.

Outside a hospital in Southern Gaza, a strike killed a local reporter and wounded six more journalists.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas militant posing as a journalist. Meantime, Israel has expanded more of its military buffer zone inside Gaza, doubling its size in recent weeks. Israel now controls more than 50 percent of the territory.\n\nIn Myanmar, the death toll from the devastating March earthquake has climbed past 3,600 people.

World powers, including China, sent new emergency aid this weekend for survivors. The U.S. has pledged $9 million of relief so far. But relief efforts have been notably absent.\n\nAs PBS News was first to report, the Trump administration last week notified the three-person disaster team from USAID of their terminations while they were on the ground in Myanmar.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily paused a midnight deadline tonight that the Trump administration faced to bring home a man they deported by mistake. The administration admitted that Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland should not have been sent to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. A judge's order from 2019 prohibited such a move. But the administration also argued it had no way to get him back because Garcia, who they accuse of MS-13 gang ties, is no longer in U.S. custody.\n\nGarcia's lawyers have until tomorrow afternoon to respond.\n\nA days-long downpour has finally let up across the Southern U.S., but it's sent some rivers overflowing to near-record levels, posing serious flood threats, especially across Kentucky.

    "content": "DORAL, Fla. (AP) — Wilmer Escaray left Venezuela in 2007 and enrolled at Miami Dade College, opening his first restaurant six years later.\n\nToday he has a dozen businesses that hire Venezuelan migrants like he once was, workers who are now terrified by what could be the end of their legal shield from deportation.\n\nSince the start of February the Trump administration has ended two federal programs that together allowed more 700,000 Venezuelans to live and work legally in the U.S. along with hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump administration asks Supreme Court to block order returning man deported to El Salvador because of error\n\nIn the largest Venezuelan community in the United States, people dread what could face them if lawsuits that aim to stop the government fail. It’s all anyone discusses in “Little Venezuela” or “Doralzuela,” a city of 80,000 people surrounded by Miami sprawl, freeways and the Florida Everglades.\n\nDeportation fears in Doralzuela\n\nPeople who lose their protections would have to remain illegally at the risk of being deported or return home, an unlikely route given the political and economic turmoil in Venezuela.\n\n“It’s really quite unfortunate to lose that human capital because there are people who do work here that other people won’t do,” Escaray, 37, said at one of his “Sabor Venezolano” restaurants.\n\nSpanish is more common than English in shopping centers along Doral’s wide avenues, and Venezuelans feel like they’re back home but with more security and comfort.\n\nA sweet scent wafts from round, flat cornmeal arepas sold at many establishments. Stores at gas stations sell flour and white cheese used to make arepas and T-shirts and hats with the yellow, blue and red stripes of the Venezuelan flag.\n\nNew lives at risk\n\nJohn came from Venezuela nine years ago and bought a growing construction company with a partner. He and his wife are on Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, which Congress created in 1990 for people in the United States whose homelands are considered unsafe to return due to natural disaster or civil strife. Beneficiaries can live and work while it lasts but TPS carries no path to citizenship.\n\nBorn in the U.S., their 5-year-old daughter is a citizen. John, 37, asked to be identified by first name only for fear of being deported.\n\nREAD MORE: What is the legal process for deporting U.S. green card and visa holders?\n\nHis wife helps with administration at their construction business while working as a real-estate broker. The couple told their daughter that they may have to leave the United States. Venezuela is not an option.\n\n“It hurts us that the government is turning its back on us,” John said. “We aren’t people who came to commit crimes; we came to work, to build.”\n\nA federal judge ordered on March 31 that temporary protected statuswould stand until a legal challenge’s next stage in court and at least 350,000 Venezuelans were temporarily spared becoming illegal. Escaray, the owner of the restaurants, said nearly all of his 150 employees are Venezuelan and more than 100 are on TPS.\n\nThe federal immigration program that allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Venezuelans, Haitians and Nicaraguans to work and live legally in the U.S. — humanitarian parole — expires April 24 absent court intervention.\n\nPolitics of migration\n\nVenezuelans were one of the main beneficiaries when former President Joe Biden sharply expanded TPS and other temporary protections. Trump tried to end them in his first term and now his second.\n\nThe mayor of Doral, home to a Trump golf club since 2012, wrote a letter to the president asking him to find a legal pathway for Venezuelans who haven’t committed crimes.\n\nThe end of the temporary protections has generated little political reaction among Republicans except for three Cuban-American representatives from Florida who called for avoiding the deportations of affected Venezuelans. Mario Díaz Balart, Carlos Gimenez and Maria Elvira Salazar have urged the government to spare Venezuelans without criminal records from deportation and review TPS beneficiaries on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe mayor of Doral, home to a Trump golf club since 2012, wrote a letter to the president asking him to find a legal pathway for Venezuelans who haven’t committed crimes.\n\n“These families do not want handouts,” said Christi Fraga, a daughter of Cuban exiles. “They want an opportunity to continue working, building, and investing in the United States.”\n\nA country’s elite, followed by the working class\n\nAbout 8 million people have fled Venezuela since 2014, settling first in neighboring countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. After the COVID-19 pandemic, they increasingly set their sights on the United States, walking through the notorious jungle in Colombia and Panama or flying to the United States on humanitarian parole with a financial sponsor.\n\nIn Doral, upper-middle-class professionals and entrepreneurs came to invest in property and businesses when socialist Hugo Chávez won the presidency in the late 1990s. They were followed by political opponents and entrepreneurs who set up small businesses. In recent years, more lower-income Venezuelans have come for work in service industries.\n\nWATCH: DHS Secretary Noem tours El Salvador prison holding deported Venezuelans\n\nThey are doctors, lawyers, beauticians, construction workers and house cleaners. Some are naturalized U.S. citizens or live in the country illegally with U.S.-born children. Others overstay tourist visas, seek asylum or have some form of temporary status.\n\nThousands went to Doral as Miami International Airport facilitated decades of growth.\n\nFrank Carreño, president of the Venezuelan American Chamber of Commerce and a Doral resident for 18 years, said there is an air of uncertainty.\n\n“What is going to happen?

    "content": "FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Days of unrelenting heavy rain and storms filled up rivers to near record levels across Kentucky on Monday, submerging neighborhoods and threatening a famed bourbon distillery in the state capital of Frankfort.\n\nSwollen rivers posed the latest threat from a series of persistent storms that have killed at least 20 people since last week — 10 of them in Tennessee — as they doused the region with heavy rains and spawned destructive tornadoes. Teeming waterways kept the flood threat high in other states, as well, including in Tennessee, Arkansas and Indiana.\n\nCities ordered evacuations and rescue crews in inflatable boats checked on residents in Kentucky and Tennessee, while utilities shut off power and gas in a region stretching from Texas to Ohio. Floodwaters forced the closure of the historic Buffalo Trace Distillery, close to the banks of the swollen Kentucky River near downtown Frankfort.\n\n“I think everybody was shocked at how quick (the river) actually did come up,” said salon owner Jessica Tuggle, who was watching Monday as murky brown water approached her business in Frankfort.\n\nShe and friends packed up her salon gear, including styling chairs, hair products and electronics, and took it to a nearby tap house up the hill.\n\n“Everybody was just ‘stop raining, stop raining’ so we could get an idea of what the worst situation would be,” she said.\n\nOfficials diverted traffic and turned off utilities to businesses in the city as the river was expected to approach a record crest Monday.\n\nAshley Welsh, her husband and four children — along with their pets — had to quickly depart their Frankfort home along the river Saturday evening, leaving a lifetime of belongings later submerged by floodwaters.\n\nREAD MORE: National Weather Service pauses severe weather alerts in Spanish and other languages\n\nWhen she awoke to water coming into their house early Saturday, Welsh woke everyone up and they packed their truck. They alerted guests to leave an Airbnb they own down the road, packed up the Airbnb and then helped her sister, who lives next to the Airbnb, evacuate. After they took a short nap at their house, the water had risen.\n\n“By the time we woke up, there was already three feet of water that we had to wade through to get out,” she said.\n\nThe water rose up to their second floor. By Sunday morning, she checked her house’s cameras.\n\n“My stuff was floating around in the living room. I was just heartbroken. Our life is up there,” Welsh said.\n\nStorms leaving devastating impact\n\nThe 20 reported deaths since the storms began on Wednesday included 10 in Tennessee. A 9-year-old boy in Kentucky was caught up in floodwaters while walking to catch his school bus. A 5-year-old boy in Arkansas died after a tree fell on his family’s home, police said. A 16-year-old volunteer Missouri firefighter died in a crash while seeking to rescue people caught in the storm.\n\nTwo men sitting in a golf cart were killed when a tree fell on them at a golf course in Columbus, Georgia, according to Muscogee County Coroner Buddy Bryan.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned Sunday that dozens of locations in multiple states were expected to reach a “major flood stage,” with extensive flooding of structures, roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure possible.\n\nIn north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth and Butler, towns near the bend of the rising Licking River. Thirty years ago, the river reached a record 50 feet (15 meters), resulting in five deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.\n\nThe Kentucky River was cresting at Frankfort Lock at 48.27 feet (14.71 meters) on Monday morning, just shy of the record of 48.5 feet (14.78 meters) set there on Dec. 10, 1978, according to CJ Padgett, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Louisville, Kentucky, office.\n\nCarroll County Deputy Judge-Executive Michael Humphrey in Kentucky ordered mandatory evacuations in some places, warning that a “significant flooding event of which history has never seen” is expected.\n\nAcross Kentucky, more than 500 state roads were still closed Monday morning, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Beshear said more than 1,000 people had no access to water and nearly 3,000 were under boil water advisories. He said at least 20 water systems were affected.\n\nThe City of Harrodsburg, Kentucky, said on social media that its water system had to discontinue pumping around midnight due to flood levels on the Kentucky River. Bottled water was being handed out Monday. The post said officials from Harrodsburg and Mercer County and leaders from factories, hospitals and schools had been discussing how to minimize water use in the community about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Frankfort.\n\nMore than 100 structures were destroyed in McNairy County, Tennessee, where a tornado tore through the town of Selmer with winds estimated up to 160 mph (257 kph), local emergency management officials said. State officials have confirmed five people were killed by the severe weather in the county of roughly 26,100 residents.\n\nThe storms come after the Trump administration cut jobs at NWS forecast offices, leaving half of them with vacancy rates of about 20%, or double the level of a decade ago.\n\nWhy so much nasty weather?\n\nForecasters attributed the violent weather to warm temperatures, an unstable atmosphere, strong winds and abundant moisture streaming from the Gulf.\n\nThe NWS said 5.06 inches (nearly 13 centimeters) of rain fell Saturday in Jonesboro, Arkansas — making it the wettest day ever recorded in April in the city. Memphis, Tennessee, received 14 inches (35 centimeters) of rain from Wednesday to Sunday, the NWS said.\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre in New York; Kimberlee Kruesi and Jonathan Mattise, in Nashville, Tennessee; Sarah Brumfield in Cockeysville, Maryland; Rebecca Reynolds in Louisville, Kentucky; Jeff Amy in Atlanta; Adrian Sainz in Memphis; Tennessee; and Obed Lamy in Rives, Tennessee.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday, becoming the first foreign leader to visit Trump since he unleashed tariffs on countries around the world.\n\nWhether Netanyahu’s visit succeeds in bringing down or eliminating Israel’s tariffs remains to be seen, but how it plays out could set the stage for how other world leaders try to address the new tariffs.\n\nTrump greeted the Israeli prime minister with a firm handshake as he arrived for talks.\n\nWATCH: What to know about the effect of Trump’s tariffs on globalization\n\nTrump ignored shouted questions from reporters about the tumbling global markets and whether he would lift tariffs on Israel.\n\nShortly before their meeting, the White House announced that Trump and Netanyahu’s plans to hold a joint news conference had been canceled. The White House did not offer any immediate explanation for why it was scrapped, but Trump and Netanyahu were expected to make comments to reporters at the start of their scheduled Oval Office meeting.\n\nNetanyahu’s office has put the focus of his hastily organized Washington visit on the tariffs, while stressing that the two leaders will discuss major geopolitical issues including the war in Gaza, tensions with Iran, Israel-Turkey ties and the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant against the Israeli leader last year. Trump in February signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC over its investigations of Israel.\n\nREAD MORE: How the White House calculated Trump’s sweeping new tariffs\n\nThe prime minister soon after arriving in Washington on Sunday evening met with senior Trump administration officials, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jameson Greer, to discuss the tariffs. And Netanyahu met on Monday with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, ahead of his sit down with the president.\n\nTrump and Netanyahu are also expected to discuss Israel’s hoped-for annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank, which the Palestinians want as the heart of their future independent state.\n\nEytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations, said he expected Trump to use the tariffs as leverage to force concessions from Netanyahu.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump advisers say more than 50 countries have reached out for tariff talks with White House\n\nIn Israel’s case, those concessions might not be economic. Trump may pressure Netanyahu to move toward ending the war in Gaza — at the very least through some interim truce with Hamas that would pause the fighting and free more hostages.\n\nGilboa said Trump is hoping to return from his first overseas trip — expected next month to Saudi Arabia — with some movement on a deal to normalize relations with Israel, which would likely require significant Israeli concessions on Gaza.\n\nIf he does manage to move toward bolstering ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, that would act as a regional diplomatic counterweight to pressure Iran, against which Trump has threatened new sanctions and suggested military action over its nuclear program.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 takeaways from the Senate budget vote and what’s next for Trump’s agenda\n\nIn a preemptive move last week, Israel announced that it was removing all tariffs on goods from the U.S., mostly on imported food and agricultural products, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office.\n\nThe statement did not mention Trump’s impending tariffs, which were announced the following day, but said Israel’s step would bolster ties with its largest trading partner, the United States. Israel is not a major trading partner of the U.S.\n\nBut the tactic failed, and with a 17% rate, Israel was just one of dozens of countries that were slapped with tariffs on Trump’s so-called Liberation Day last week.\n\nAlthough Israel is a tiny market for U.S. products, the United States is a key trade partner of Israel. Much of that trade is for high-tech services, which are not directly affected by the tariffs, but key Israeli industries could be impacted.\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Israel estimates that the tariffs will cost Israel about $3 billion in exports each year and lead to the loss of 26,000 jobs in industries that include biotechnology, chemicals, plastics and electronics. The World Bank says Israel’s gross domestic product, a measure of economic output, is over $500 billion a year.\n\n“The damage won’t stop at exports,” said Ron Tomer, the group’s president. “It will scare investors, encourage companies to leave Israel and undermine our image as a global center of innovation.” He called on the government to work urgently to protect the economy.\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.",

It was a party that was there specifically to see a player get his crowning achievement.\n\nAnd he almost did it in one night. And then to do what he did on Long Island on Sunday in front of so many Capitals fans who made their way to New York and so many New York hockey fans who recognized the greatness that they were seeing unfold before them, they treated themselves, with the Islanders as hosts, obviously stopping the game for almost 25 minutes to celebrate this man's achievement — just a tip of the cap to them, a job extremely well done.\n\nBut, for me, I don't know that I will be treated to more exhilarating moments than that.

    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Chief Justice John Roberts agreed Monday to pause a midnight deadline for the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe temporary order comes hours after a Justice Department emergency appeal to the Supreme Court arguing U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis overstepped her authority when she ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the United States.\n\nThe administration has conceded that Abrego Garcia should not have been sent to El Salvador because an immigration judge found he likely would face persecution by local gangs.\n\nREAD MORE: ICE: ‘Administrative error’ sent a Maryland man to an El Salvador prison\n\nBut he is no longer in U.S. custody and the government has no way to get him back, the administration argued.\n\nXinis gave the administration until just before midnight to “facilitate and effectuate” Abrego Garcia’s return.\n\n“The district court’s injunction—which requires Abrego Garcia’s release from the custody of a foreign sovereign and return to the United States by midnight on Monday—is patently unlawful,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in court papers, casting the order as one in “a deluge of unlawful injunctions” judges have issued to slow President Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nThe Justice Department appeal was directed to Roberts because he handles appeals from Maryland.\n\nThe Trump administration is separately asking the Supreme Court to allow Trump to resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members to the same Salvadoran prison under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nThe federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, denied the administration’s request for a stay. “There is no question that the government screwed up here,” Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote in a brief opinion accompanying the unanimous denial.\n\nThe White House has described Abrego Garcia’s deportation as an “administrative error” but has also cast him an MS-13 gang member. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia said there is no evidence he was in MS-13.\n\n“The Executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,” Abrego Garcia’s lawyers wrote in a response filed moments after Roberts issued his temporary pause.\n\nXinis wrote that the decision to arrest him and send him to El Salvador appears to be “wholly lawless,” explaining that little to no evidence supports a “vague, uncorroborated” allegation that Abrego Garcia was once an MS-13 member.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who has never been charged or convicted of any crime, was detained by immigration agents and deported last month.\n\nHe had a permit from DHS to legally work in the U.S. and was a sheet metal apprentice pursuing a journeyman license, his attorney said. His wife is a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn 2019, an immigration judge barred the U.S. from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.\n\nA Justice Department lawyer conceded in a court hearing that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported. Attorney General Pam Bondi later removed the lawyer, Erez Reuveni, from the case and placed him on leave.",

    "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
    "content": "KAKUMA, Kenya (AP) — Windswept and remote, set in the cattle-rustling lands of Kenya’s northwest, Kakuma was never meant to be permanently settled.\n\nIt became one of Africa’s most famous refugee camps by accident as people escaping calamity in countries like South Sudan, Ethiopia and Congo poured in.\n\nMore than three decades after its first tents appeared in 1992, Kakuma houses 300,000 refugees. Many rely on aid to survive. Some recently clashed with police over shrinking food rations and support.\n\nNow the Kenyan government and humanitarian agencies have come up with an ambitious plan for Kakuma to evolve into a city.\n\nAlthough it remains under the United Nations’ management, Kakuma has been redesignated a municipality, one that local government officials later will run.\n\nIt is part of broader goal in Kenya and elsewhere of incorporating refugees more closely into local populations and shifting from prolonged reliance on aid.\n\nThe refugees in Kakuma eventually will have to fend for themselves, living off their incomes rather than aid. The nearest city is eight hours’ drive away.\n\nSuch self-reliance is not easy. Few refugees can become Kenyan citizens. A 2021 law recognizes their right to work in formal employment, but only a tiny minority are allowed to do so.\n\nForbidden from keeping livestock because of the arid surroundings and the inability to roam widely, and unable to farm due to the lack of adequate water, many refugees see running a business as their only option.\n\n‘World-class entrepreneurs’\n\nStartup businesses require capital, and interest rates on loans from banks in Kakuma are typically around 20%. Few refugees have the collateral and documentation needed to take out a loan.\n\nDenying them access to credit is a tremendous waste of human capital, said Julienne Oyler, who runs Inkomoko, a charity providing financial training and low-cost loans to African businesses, primarily in displacement-affected communities.\n\n“We find that refugee business owners actually have the characteristics that make world-class entrepreneurs,” she said.\n\n“They are resilient. They are resourceful. They have access to networks. They have adaptability. In some ways, what refugees unfortunately have had to go through actually makes a really good business owner.”\n\nOther options available include microloans from other aid groups or collective financing by refugee-run groups. However, the sums involved are usually insufficient for all but the smallest startups.\n\nOne of Inkomoko’s clients in Kakuma, Adele Mubalama, led seven young children — six of her own and an abandoned 12-year-old she found en route — on a hazardous journey to the camp through four countries after the family was forced to leave Congo in 2018.\n\nAt the camp it took six months to find her husband, who had fled two months earlier, and six more to figure out how to make a living.\n\n“It was difficult to know how to survive,” Mubalama said. “We didn’t know how to get jobs and there were no business opportunities.”\n\nAfter signing up for a tailoring course with a Danish charity, she found herself making fabric masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWATCH: Afghans who helped Americans fear Taliban retribution after U.S. suspends refugee program\n\nAble to borrow from Inkomoko at half the rate charged by banks, she expanded, taking on 26 employees and buying new sewing machines. Last year she made a profit of $8,300 — a huge amount when many refugees live on allowances or vouchers of about $10 or less a month.\n\nAnother beneficiary is Mesfin Getahun, a former soldier who fled Ethiopia for Kakuma in 2001 after helping students who had protested against the government. He has grown his “Jesus is Lord” shops, which sell everything from groceries to motorcycles, into Kakuma’s biggest retail chain. That’s thanks in part to $115,000 in loans from Inkomoko.\n\nTrading with other towns is also essential. Inkomoko has linked refugee businesses with suppliers in Eldoret, a city 300 miles (482 kilometers) to the south, to cut out expensive middlemen and help embed Kakuma into Kenya’s economy.\n\nOther challenges\n\nSome question the vision of Kakuma becoming a thriving, self-reliant city.\n\nRahul Oka, an associate research professor with the University of Notre Dame said it lacks the resources — particularly water — and infrastructure to sustain a viable economy that can rely on local production.\n\n“You cannot reconstruct an organic economy by socially engineering one,” said Oka, who has studied economic life at Kakuma for many years.\n\nTwo-way trade remains almost nonexistent. Suppliers send food and secondhand clothes to Kakuma, but trucks on the return journey are usually empty.\n\nAnd the vast majority of refugees lack the freedom to move elsewhere in Kenya, where jobs are easier to find, said Freddie Carver of ODI Global, a London-based think tank.\n\nUnless this is addressed, solutions offering greater opportunities to refugees cannot deliver meaningful transformation for most of them, he said.\n\n“If you go back 20 years, a lot of refugee rights discourse was about legal protections, the right to work, the right to stay in a country permanently,” Carver said. “Now it’s all about livelihoods and self-sufficiency. The emphasis is so much on opportunities that it overshadows the question of rights. There needs to be a greater balance.”",

    "source": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/",
    "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street could soon be in the claws of another bear market as the Trump administration’s tariff blitz fuels fears that the added taxes on imported goods from around the world will sink the global economy.\n\nThe last bear market happened in 2022, but this decline feels more like the sudden, turbulent bear market of 2020, when the benchmark S&P 500 index tumbled 34 percent in a one-month period, the shortest bear market ever.\n\nREAD MORE: U.S. stocks dip at the end of a manic Monday, fueled by Trump’s latest tariff threat\n\nHere are some common questions about bear markets.\n\nWhy is it called a bear market?\n\nA bear market is a term used by Wall Street when an index such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 20 percent or more from a recent high for a sustained period of time.\n\nWhy use a bear to refer to a market slump? Bears hibernate, so they represent a stock market that’s retreating. In contrast, Wall Street’s nickname for a surging market is a bull market, because bulls charge.\n\nThe S&P 500, Wall Street’s main barometer of health, was down 1.2 percent in Monday afternoon trading. It’s now 18.4 percent below the all-time high it set on Feb. 19.\n\nThe Dow industrials fell 1.8 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which already was in a bear market, dropped 0.9 percent.\n\nThe most recent bear market for the S&P 500 ran from Jan. 3 to Oct. 12 in 2022.\n\nWhat’s bothering investors?\n\nThe trade war has ratcheted up fear and uncertainty on Wall Street over how businesses and consumers will respond.\n\nPresident Donald Trump followed through on tariff threats last week by declaring a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.\n\nGlobal markets cratered the next day, and the sell-off deepened after China announced it would retaliate with tariffs equal to the ones from the U.S.\n\nTariffs cause economic pain in part because they’re a tax paid by importers that often gets passed along to consumers, adding to inflationary pressure. They also provoke trading partners into retaliating, which can hurt all economies involved.\n\nWATCH: Trump compares tariff policy to ‘medicine’ as market futures crash\n\nImport taxes can also cause economic damage by complicating the decisions businesses have to make, including which suppliers to use, where to locate factories and what prices to charge. And that uncertainty can cause them to delay or cancel investments that help drive economic growth.\n\nThe tariffs come at a time when the U.S. economy is already showing signs of slowing. Markets are also worried that tariffs could fuel inflation, which recently ticked higher.\n\nHow long do bear markets last and how deep do they go?\n\nOn average, bear markets have taken 13 months to go from peak to trough and 27 months to get back to breakeven since World War II. The S&P 500 index has fallen an average of 33 percent during bear markets in that time. The biggest decline since 1945 occurred in the 2007-2009 bear market, when the S&P 500 fell 57 percent.\n\nHistory shows that the faster an index enters into a bear market, the shallower they tend to be. Historically, stocks have taken 251 days (8.3 months) to fall into a bear market. When the S&P 500 has fallen 20 percent at a faster clip, the index has averaged a loss of 28 percent.\n\nThe longest bear market lasted 61 months and ended in March 1942. It cut the index by 60 percent.\n\nWhen is a bear market over?\n\nGenerally, investors look for a 20 percent gain from a low point as well as sustained gains over at least a six-month period. It took less than three weeks for stocks to rise 20 percent from their low in March 2020.\n\nShould investors sell now?\n\nIf you need the money now or want to lock in the losses, yes. Otherwise, many advisers suggest riding through the ups and downs while remembering the swings are the price of admission for the stronger returns that stocks have provided over the long term.\n\nWhile dumping stocks would stop the bleeding, it would also prevent any potential gains. Many of the best days for Wall Street have occurred either during a bear market or just after one ended. That includes two separate days in the middle of the 2007-2009 bear market when the S&P 500 surged roughly 11 percent, as well as leaps of better than 9 percent during and shortly after the monthlong 2020 bear market.\n\nREAD MORE: Feeling queasy about the stock market? Think twice before selling, financial advisers say\n\nAdvisers suggest putting money into stocks only if it will not be needed for several years. The S&P 500 has come back from every one of its prior bear markets to eventually rise to another all-time high.\n\nThe down decade for the stock market following the 2000 bursting of the dot-com bubble was a notoriously brutal stretch, but stocks have often been able to regain their highs within a few years.\n\nVeiga reported from Los Angeles.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president Monday, promising a “revolution of common sense” and taking charge as Republicans assume unified control of Washington and set out to reshape the country’s institutions.\n\nWatch all of the Inauguration Day events live in the player above.\n\nTrump, who overcame impeachments, criminal indictments and a pair of assassination attempts to win another term in the White House, will act swiftly after the ceremony, with executive orders already prepared for his signature to clamp down on border crossings, increase fossil fuel development and end diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government.\n\nWatch our PBS News special coverage below.\n\n\n\nWATCH: President-elect Trump speaks to supporters at rally on eve of his inauguration\n\nDeclaring that government faces a “crisis of trust,” Trump said in his inaugural address that under his administration “our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”\n\nTrump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\n\nHe added: “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nPBS News, in partnership with DPAN, is offering simultaneous translation of our special coverage in American Sign Language. Watch that livestream below.\n\n\n\nThe executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”\n\nFrigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happened in 40 years — and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities.\n\nREAD MORE: Your schedule of events for Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nAt the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.\n\nA cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 things that have changed since Trump’s 1st inauguration\n\nTrump began the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.\n\n“Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\n\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\n\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\n\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\n\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\n\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\n\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\n\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\n\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\n\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\n\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\n\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\n\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\n\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

    "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday the U.S. will hold direct talks with Iran about its nuclear program, while warning Tehran it would be in “great danger” if the talks aren’t successful.\n\nWatch President Donald Trump’s comments in the video player above.\n\nThe president, in comments to reporters after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the talks will start Saturday. He insisted Tehran can’t get nuclear weapons.\n\n“We’re dealing with them directly and maybe a deal is going to be made,” Trump said. He added that “doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious.”\n\nAsked if he would commit to military action against Iran should his negotiators be unable to come to terms with Tehran, Trump responded that “Iran is going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it.”\n\n“If the talks aren’t successful, I think it’s going to be a very bad day for Iran,” Trump said.\n\nTrump during his first White House term withdrew the U.S. from the landmark nuclear accord with Iran negotiated by Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration.\n\nBelow, watch the Oval Office meeting between Trump and Netanyahu.\n\n\n\nNetanyahu says he supports Trump’s diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement with Iran, adding that Israel and the U.S. share the same goal of ensuring that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe Israeli leader, known for his hawkish views on Iran and past calls for military pressure, said he would welcome a diplomatic agreement along the lines of Libya’s deal with the international community in 2003.\n\n“I think that would be a good thing,” he said. “But whatever happens, we have to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons.”\n\nTrump said the talks would happen “at almost the highest level,” but declined to say where the negotiations would take place or who he was dispatching for the sensitive diplomacy.\n\nHe announced plans for the surprise engagement as Netanyahu made a hastily arranged visit to the White House — his second in just over two months — to discuss the tariffs Trump has unleashed on countries around the world, Iran’s nuclear program and the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Trump declared he was making the world safer, but he also deepened his isolation on the world stage and revived doubts about American credibility.\n\nThe agreement, which also included Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, had lifted most U.S. and international economic sanctions against Iran.\n\n“I think it’ll be, different and maybe a lot stronger,” Trump said on how a new deal might be different from the one negotiated by Obama officials.\n\nTrump and Netanyahu said they also discussed tensions with Iran, Israel-Turkey ties and the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant against the Israeli leader last year. Trump in February signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC over its investigations of Israel.\n\nBefore his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump held a call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II. All three leaders have been key interlocutors in efforts to tamp down tensions in the Middle East and bring an end to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe prime minister soon after arriving in Washington on Sunday evening met with senior Trump administration officials, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jameson Greer, to discuss the tariffs. And Netanyahu met on Monday with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, ahead of his sit down with the president.\n\nOn tariffs, Netanyahu said he assured Trump that his government would move to erase United States trade deficit.\n\n“We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States,” Netanyahu said “We intend to do it very quickly.”\n\nEytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations, said he expected Trump to use the tariffs as leverage to force concessions from Netanyahu.\n\nIn Israel’s case, those concessions might not be economic. Trump may pressure Netanyahu to move toward ending the war in Gaza — at the very least through some interim truce with Hamas that would pause the fighting and free more hostages.\n\nGilboa said Trump is hoping to return from his first overseas trip — expected next month to Saudi Arabia — with some movement on a deal to normalize relations with Israel, which would likely require significant Israeli concessions on Gaza.\n\nIf he does manage to move toward bolstering ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, that would act as a regional diplomatic counterweight to pressure Iran, against which Trump has threatened new sanctions and suggested military action over its nuclear program.\n\nIn a preemptive move last week, Israel announced that it was removing all tariffs on goods from the U.S., mostly on imported food and agricultural products, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office.\n\nBut the tactic failed, and with a 17 percent rate, Israel was just one of dozens of countries that were slapped with tariffs on Trump’s so-called Liberation Day last week.\n\nAlthough Israel is a tiny market for U.S. products, the United States is a key trade partner of Israel. Much of that trade is for high-tech services, which are not directly affected by the tariffs, but key Israeli industries could be impacted.\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Israel estimates that the tariffs will cost Israel about $3 billion in exports each year and lead to the loss of 26,000 jobs in industries that include biotechnology, chemicals, plastics and electronics. The World Bank says Israel’s gross domestic product, a measure of economic output, is over $500 billion a year.\n\n“The damage won’t stop at exports,” said Ron Tomer, the group’s president. “It will scare investors, encourage companies to leave Israel and undermine our image as a global center of innovation.” He called on the government to work urgently to protect the economy.\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

    "content": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Family and friends of former U.S. Rep. Mia Love gathered Monday in Salt Lake City to honor the life and legacy of the first Black Republican woman elected to Congress after she died of brain cancer last month at age 49.\n\nThe former lawmaker from Utah, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, had undergone treatment for an aggressive brain tumor called glioblastoma and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial. She died March 23 at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, weeks after her daughter announced she was no longer responding to treatment.\n\nHundreds of mourners entered her service from a walkway lined with American flags at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Institute of Religion on the University of Utah campus. Long tables displayed framed family photos and bouquets of red and white flowers.\n\nLove served only two terms in Congress before suffering a razor-thin loss to Democrat Ben McAdams in the 2018 midterm elections as Democrats surged. Yet she left her mark on Utah’s political scene and later leveraged her prominence into becoming a political commentator for CNN.\n\nShe was briefly considered a rising star in the GOP, but her power within the party fizzled out as President Donald Trump took hold. Love kept her distance from Trump and called him out in 2018 for vulgar comments he made about immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and some African nations.\n\nJason Love, her husband, drew laughter from the somber crowd at Monday’s service when he told stories of his wife’s “superpowers.”\n\nHe described discovering her influence after he tried to return the many toasters the couple received as wedding gifts and failing because he didn’t have receipts. His wife then entered the store and came out three minutes later with cash in hand.\n\n“I thought, ‘Wow, I have married a Jedi knight,’” he said with a laugh.\n\nREAD MORE: Former Rep. Mia Love, the first Black Republican woman elected to the U.S. House, dies at 49\n\nHer motherhood, he said, was her greatest superpower.\n\n“She was an extraordinary mother, and she believed that the most important work she would do within her life was within the walls of her own home with her children,” Jason Love said. “She always made it a special place for each of them to feel loved and to begin to achieve their full potential.”\n\nA choir of Love’s friends sang some of her favorite hymns, as well as Ed Sheeran’s “Supermarket Flowers.” Her children, Alessa, Abigale and Peyton, read an op-ed their mother published in the Deseret News shortly before she died in which she shared her enduring wish for the nation to become less divisive.\n\nLove’s sister Cyndi Brito shared childhood memories, including how Love used to rehearse all day and night for starring roles in her school plays. She was always the best at everything she did and made everyone around her feel important, her sister said.\n\nBrito read an excerpt of a speech her third-grade daughter gave at a recent school assembly for Black History Month honoring Love’s legacy.\n\n“’Mia Love played many roles and had many titles, but the most important role and the most important title that Mia Love played in my eyes was auntie,’” Brito recalled her daughter, Carly, telling classmates.\n\nLove did not emphasize her race during her campaigns, but she acknowledged the significance of her election after her 2014 victory. She said her win defied naysayers who suggested a Black, Republican, Mormon woman could not win a congressional seat in overwhelmingly white Utah.\n\nOn Sunday evening, state leaders and members of the public visited the Utah Capitol to pay their respects at Love’s flag-covered coffin behind ropes in the building’s rotunda.\n\nLove, born Ludmya Bourdeau, was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2022 and said her doctors estimated she had only 10 to 15 months to live, which she surpassed. With aggressive treatments, Love lived for nearly three years after receiving her diagnosis.\n\nHer close friend, Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, told the audience Monday that Love had asked her friends and family to rally around her like a campaign team when she was diagnosed.\n\n“‘I’m in fight mode,’ she told us, ‘and what I need from you all, more than anything, is to help me fight it. This is a campaign, and we are going to win,’” Henderson recalled.\n\nLove entered politics in 2003 after winning a city council seat in Saratoga Springs, 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City. She was elected as the city’s mayor in 2009, becoming the first Black woman to serve as a mayor in Utah.\n\nIn 2012, after giving a rousing speech at the Republican National Convention, she narrowly lost a bid for the U.S. House against the Democratic incumbent. She ran again two years later and won.",

    "content": "Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nDonald Trump won the 2020 election,” Steve Bannon pronounces. “Of that there is not even a question.\"\n\nObviously you expect me not to agree with you, I say. “Of course I expect you not to agree with me,” he says. “And I’m also not looking for you to agree with me. And I also don’t give a fuck who in the mainstream media agrees or disagrees with me.”\n\nAnd so off we go—about this and about Covid (the Bannon view: “It’s 100 percent a bioweapon—fucking not even a question”) and about vaccines (“I would never in ten million years get this vaccine,” Bannon says, and asks if I would; I simply hand him my vax card, which he looks at with apparent amazement: “I’ve never . . .”) and about what I view—but naturally Bannon doesn’t—as his incessant anti-Semitic dog-whistling. At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\n\nOr misinformation, I say.\n\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\n\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\n\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\n\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\n\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\n\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\n\n“That will be impossible.”\n\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\n\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\n\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\n\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\n\n\n\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\n\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\n\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\n\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\n\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\n\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\n\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\n\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\n\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\n\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\n\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\n\n\n\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\n\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\n\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\n\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\n\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\n\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\n\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\n\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\n\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\n\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\n\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\n\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\n\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\n\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\n\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\n\nDid you cry?\n\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\n\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\n\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\n\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\n\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\n\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\n\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\n\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\n\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\n\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\n\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\n\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\n\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\n\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\n\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\n\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\n\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\n\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\n\n\n\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\n\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\n\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\n\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\n\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\n\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\n\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\n\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\n\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\n\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\n\nYou must have advocated for it.\n\n“No, never.”\n\nReally?\n\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\n\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\n\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\n\nWhy do you think he did it?\n\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\n\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\n\n\n\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\n\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\n\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\n\n\n\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\n\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\n\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\n\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\n\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\n\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\n\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\n\nOkay.\n\n“This is not an existential moment.”\n\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\n\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\n\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\n\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\n\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\n\n“Are they in the book?”\n\nSome of them.\n\n“I don’t remember.”\n\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\n\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\n\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\n\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\n\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\n\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\n\nI agree that he has not.\n\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\n\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\n\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\n\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\n\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\n\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\n\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\n\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\n\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\n\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\n\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\n\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\n\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\n\n“Okay. Okay.”\n\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\n\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\n\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\n\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\n\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\n\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\n\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\n\nBut that’s a tragedy.\n\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\n\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\n\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\n\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\n\n\n\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\n\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\n\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\n\nHis answer comes back immediately.\n\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\n\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.",

    "content": "At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\n\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\n\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\n\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\n\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\n\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\n\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\n\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\n\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\n\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\n\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\n\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\n\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\n\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\n\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\n\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\n\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\n\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\n\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\n\nIt would be his undoing.\n\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\n\nI’m looking now, just across the river\n\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\n\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\n\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\n\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\n\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-­dressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\n\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\n\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\n\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\n\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\n\n\n\nMr. Monger,\n\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\n\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\n\nHypocrite!\n\nHAHA faggot.\n\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n\n\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\n\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\n\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\n\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\n\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\n\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\n\nBubba, where are the guns?\n\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\n\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\n\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\n\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\n\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\n\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\n\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\n\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\n\n\n\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\n\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\n\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\n\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\n\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\n\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\n\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\n\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\n\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\n\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\n\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\n\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\n\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\n\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\n\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\n\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\n\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\n\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\n\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\n\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\n\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\n\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\n\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\n\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\n\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\n\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\n\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\n\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\n\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\n\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\n\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\n\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\n\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\n\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\n\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\n\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\n\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\n\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres­sive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\n\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\n\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\n\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\n\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\n\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug­gle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\n\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\n\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\n\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-­four-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\n\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\n\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\n\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\n\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\n\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\n\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\n\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\n\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\n\n\n\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\n\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\n\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\n\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\n\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\n\n“I won’t,” her father said.\n\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\n\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics­ville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\n\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\n\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\n\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\n\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\n\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\n\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\n\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\n\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\n\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\n\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\n\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\n\n\n\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\n\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\n\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\n\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\n\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\n\n“I came to check on you.”\n\n“Who’s with you?”\n\n“I’m by myself.”\n\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\n\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\n\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\n\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\n\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\n\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\n\n“Let me talk to him.”\n\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\n\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\n\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\n\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\n\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\n\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\n\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\n\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\n\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\n\nAnd then silence.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\n\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\n\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\n\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\n\n",

    "title": "The Louisiana Governor Fought for New MAGA-Friendly Amendments—and All Four Lost",
    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "Keep your face always toward the sunshine, said old Walt Whitman, and shadows will fall behind you. So let’s take what we can get. This weekend, in blazing-red Louisiana, Governor Jeff Landry got his jewels kicked through the roof of his mouth. Landry threw his support behind four MAGA-friendly amendments to the state constitution, and all four of them lost. From the Louisiana Illuminator:\n\n\n\nNearly two-thirds of voters rejected all of the amendments in an election that could have broader political implications for the rest of Landry’s term. The governor, who has sometimes relied on strong-arm tactics to get his agenda through the Louisiana Legislature, could become more vulnerable to pushback after failing to pass his most ambitious policy proposal at the ballot box.\n\nLandry’s priority for the election, Amendment 2, would have lowered the maximum income tax rate the state could enact and restricted annual state budget increases. It also would have made it more difficult to enact new tax breaks. The proposal was expected to produce a financial windfall for Landry and state legislators later this year. Amendment 2 would have moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund, where Landry and state legislators could have spent it more easily.\n\nIn Louisiana? Bad idea. Very damn bad idea.\n\nAmendment 3, which 66% of voters opposed, would have made it easier to send more minors to adult jails and prisons for longer sentences. It spurred national criminal justice reform organizations, such as the Vera Institute and Southern Poverty Law Center, to spend more than $500,000 to turn voters against it. Sarah Omojola, Louisiana director for the Vera Institute, said the results for Amendment 3 show voters are starting to reject incarceration as the sole option for criminal justice. She added that high incarceration rates have only served to destabilize communities rather than reduce crime. “In defeating Amendment 3, voters made clear their desire for the things that actually make our communities safer—like quality education and opportunity,” Omojola said in a statement.\n\nThat is a thoroughgoing ass-kicking—66 percent? zowie—and it is yet another example of conservative policies being far less popular than the people dreaming them up. This shutout was also an example of effective political branding and organization. A lot of people should take careful notes about what the people who beat these amendments have done.\n\nWhile those organizations focused on defeating Amendment 3, they also became the backbone of a “No on All” campaign working to vote down all four of the constitutional amendments Landry was pushing. Supporters of the tax proposal in Amendment 2 said they believed the criminal justice issue had a negative effect on their measure in interviews earlier this week. “[Amendment 3] is a huge motivation of the groups that are saying no to everything. That seems to be the motivating factor,” said Daniel Erspamer, CEO of the Pelican Institute, a conservative think tank that helped push the tax and budget amendment.\n\n“No on all.” Simple, easily understood, and a more than decent rallying cry. It made for a fine bumper sticker too. And it tacitly recognizes that the assault on American institutions is a general threat that requires a general result.\n\n\n\nThe defeat of Amendments 2 and 3 also likely led to the downfall of Amendment 1, which failed with 65% of voters against the proposal. It would have allowed the formation of specialty courts in Louisiana with jurisdiction outside current parish and judicial districts. Amendment 4 also failed, with 64% of voters. It would have adjusted the rules for special elections to fill vacant or new judgeships, primarily on the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n\nTurnout for the election was also higher than anticipated. There were no other statewide issues to decide, and only a limited number of local races. Projections called for 12% of state voters of cast ballots, but numbers from the Secretary of State placed turnout at 21%.\n\n“No on all” sounds like it might fit future judicial nominations right nicely, cher.\n\n",

    "title": "Elon Musk Is Ratcheting Up His Efforts to Distort the Democratic Process in Wisconsin",
    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where it looks like nothing but rain.\n\nWe begin in Wisconsin, where we check in on the country’s most superheated state supreme court race and discover that a certain wealthy South African chain-saw enthusiast has decided to have his fun by perverting the democratic process one more time. From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:\n\nMusk took to X, the social media platform he owns, to announce Wednesday evening that “Scott A.” from Green Bay had won the sum for signing Musk’s “Petition in Opposition to Activist Judges.” The petition was announced late last week on the X account of Musk’s super PAC, America PAC. It offers $100 in cash to people who sign the election petition but does not mention a $1 million giveaway.\n\n“Crazy Elon ... his prices are ... INSANE!”\n\nThe $1 million giveaway was initially announced by America PAC, though the super PAC’s spending records make no mention of that payment. More than $2 million in independent expenditures in recent days have been for texting, field operations and canvassing.\n\nLet us once again thank Baal for the wisdom of former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy who, when confronted with the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, was moved to make this remark.\n\nWe now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. … The fact that speakers [editor’s note: i.e., donors] may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt. … The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\n\nGood call, Anthony.\n\nAt issue in Wisconsin is the ideological balance of the state supreme court. Democrat Susan Crawford is being challenged by career wing nut Brad Schimel. The race is now the most expensive state judicial race in history, and have I mentioned recently what a terrible idea an elected judiciary is? A Schimel victory, and a conservative majority on the Wisconsin court, likely would re-gerrymander the state legislature.\n\nMusk wrote that the next award would be announced Friday. He has spent about $20 million backing conservative Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel in Tuesday’s election, when Schimel will go head-to-head against liberal Dane County Judge Susan Crawford. Musk’s spending has made him the single largest spender in the race that an election watchdog group has predicted could top a record-breaking $100 million in spending.\n\nCrawford’s campaign spokesman slammed Musk and Schimel over the payouts. “It turns out that Schimel is such a bad candidate that Elon Musk will spend whatever it takes to prop up Schimel’s failing campaign in a corrupt attempt to buy influence on the Supreme Court for his company’s lawsuit,” spokesman Derrick Honeyman said in a statement, referencing the lawsuit by another Musk company, Tesla, against the State of Wisconsin. “It’s corrupt, it’s extreme, and it’s disgraceful to our state and judiciary.”\n\nBut not “corrupt.” Ask Mr. Justice Kennedy.\n\nWe move along to North Carolina, where another supreme court race continues to stagger on because the Republican candidate declines to accept defeat, choosing instead to challenge a huge number of ballots on what are apparently bogus grounds. Republican Jefferson Griffin lost to incumbent Democrat Allison Riggs by 734 votes. This result has been certified through two recounts. He now has gone to a court of appeals to argue that the election rules should be changed retroactively and thousands of votes be tossed out. The grounds are spurious at best; Griffin seeks to eliminate ballots cast by voters whose registrations lacked driver’s license or Social Security numbers even though neither was required at the time of the election.\n\nAs it happens, on Monday, the Supreme Court of the United States heard arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, another critical voting-rights case, this one aimed at gutting section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which is the last viable element of that landmark bill left functioning after the carefully manufactured conservative majority on the court got done with it. At issue was a court order mandating that Louisiana create a second majority-minority district. A good measure of section 2’s future is the fact that even the lawyers arguing Louisiana’s case told the court that they thought section 2 was unconstitutional but that they followed it anyway. Thanks, folks. However, the liberal justices, most notably Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noticed that one side seemed to be arguing that it could ignore an adverse ruling. As we know, there’s a lot of that going around. Jackson said:\n\nI mean, I ... am sort of concerned about your view—as seemingly expressed, and I want you to clarify it—that a court order compelling you to do something is not a good reason for you to do it.\n\nKagan, meanwhile, was struck by the fact that the people opposed to the new district kept getting beaten in court, only to come back for more.\n\nSo ... I get the idea that it did have the option to keep on finding ways to litigate this question, but ... there were ways that it could have refused to give up. I take that point. But at some point, it said ... we’ve been told we’re wrong by seven judges, and we’re going to accept that and we’re going to move on and find a map. And then the state lawyers come in and ... the record is the state lawyer says there can be no better reasons to believe that the VRA required a second majority Black district than a precedential opinion of the Fifth Circuit affirming that a map with a single majority Black district likely violated section 2. And the state lawyer talks about all the process that they went through and all—and hearing that they had and the maps that were submitted. And she says what better reason could there be for this?\n\nRepublicans simply do not lose elections. That is a hard and fast rule in American politics. They just run out the clock, and the clock never reaches zero.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Oyster Shucker Friedman of the Algarve brings us the tale of some ducks who seem to have a very good class action lawsuit. From KFOR:\n\nNine ducks are now recovering after diesel fuel leaked into a duck pond at the University of Oklahoma earlier this month. News 4 first reported on the ducks last week when residents voiced concerns about a strong chemical odor coming from the pond and an oily substance covering the ducks. The Department of Environmental Quality later told News 4 a power plant pump had malfunctioned, causing diesel to leak into the duck pond.\n\nOn Tuesday, News 4 learned that nine ducks were washed with a solution and are now undergoing waterproofing therapy in a special pool. While WildCare says the ducks do show signs of chemical burns, especially around the eyes, they currently don’t have any symptoms of gastrointestinal issues from swallowing the fuel.

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "Plutocracy knows no borders. Neither does its beloved cousin, political corruption. The good people at the DeSmog blog have connected a whole bunch of dots, some of which lead directly back to the usual suspects this side of the Maple Syrup Meridian. There may be tariffs on Canadian imports, but the market in influence peddling is thriving.\n\nThe point person in Canada is one Pierre Poilievre, who is leading the federal Conservatives into the snap election at the end of April. Poilievre, it seems, has wired himself into the wing-nut welfare systems in both countries.\n\nKoch Industries, Elon Musk’s X Corp., Loblaws, Enbridge, Pathways Alliance, the Canadian Gas Association, Rumble Canada, Rebel News, Canada Proud, and Facebook. These are just a handful of the corporate interests and right-wing communications platforms linked to the inner circle of Pierre Poilievre and his federal Conservatives as Canada heads into a snap federal election scheduled for April 28.\n\nThe key to the Canadian end of this continental drift to the right is the powerful Canadian extraction industries in the western part of the country. In this, of course, they are allied with the drill-baby-drill strain of American conservatism, and both wings were frustrated by the collapse of the Keystone XL pipeline, the continent-spanning death funnel intended to bring the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel from the petro-state wastelands of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.\n\nPoilievre has for years portrayed himself as a champion of the country’s blue-collar workers who comes from “humble origins,” claiming during a speech last year that “when I’m prime minister, my obsession—my daily obsession—will be about what is best for the working-class people of this country.” Yet Poilievre and his party are linked to oil and gas companies that have made record profits from gas price inflation, grocery chains accused of price-gouging, and companies owned by the world’s richest man, Musk, a key figure in the Trump administration.\n\nUsing the map, it’s clear that the Conservative Party’s National Council, the party’s highest authority on governance matters, is a hotbed for corporate lobbyists. That isn’t a coincidence, as Conservative party members several years ago voted down a resolution barring lobbyists from the council, as The Breach reported. As a result, the organization has members such as Aaron Scheewe, managing director at the lobby group Capitol Hill Group, whose clients include X Corp.—the social media platform formerly known as Twitter—as well as MBDA Missile Systems and the Canadian International Pharmacy Association. Another council member, Anthony Matar, is a current lobbyist at Crestview Strategies, which represents cigarette companies, the oil and gas sector, and the Canadian arm of the far-right social media platform Rumble.\n\nThe council’s president, Stephen Barber, is a vice president at the lobbying firm StrategyCorp, whose clients include Pathways Alliance, an industry group comprised of Canada’s six largest oil sands companies. Poilievre himself has close ties to lobbyists. His former director of policy, David Murray, is now a senior vice president with the advocacy, marketing, and research group One Persuasion, which the National Observer reported was behind an anonymous ad campaign on Facebook claiming that “government regulation is making you poorer by stifling investment in Canada’s oil and gas sector.”\n\nThis is a far more conventional modern conservative movement than Trumpism is. For one thing, it is directly connected to a previous generation of Canadian conservative politicians.\n\nFor the first decade or so that Poilievre was a member of parliament, he served under Conservative leader Stephen Harper. That connection persists to this day through political operatives such as Hamish Marshall, a partner at One Persuasion, who says that “he was the liaison between the central agencies of government and the Prime Minister’s Office on all matters relating to public opinion research” during years when Harper was in power. Marshall also co-founded the right-wing media outlet Rebel News in 2015.\n\nHarper, who is widely seen as Poilievre’s political mentor, is himself the owner of the lobby group Harper Associates, which shares a staff member with Wellington Advocacy, another lobby group that counts Koch Industries, Suncor, and Pembina Pipeline among its clients. Haley Love, a former Wellington consultant, has helped lead digital services for Poilievre. She also formerly worked with Mobilize Media, the conservative communications firm behind the Facebook account Canada Proud. Mobilize was previously retained to work on Poilievre’s leadership campaign for the federal Conservatives. Canada Proud has been running multiple Facebook ads attacking Liberal leader Mark Carney by insinuating he has connections to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nLovely.\n\nOne thing that Poilievre and the American president have in common is the performative benefits of the Friend of the Working Stiff pose. The DeSmog report shows that approach to be as phony in Canada as it has been here, which, as we have learned to our deep distress, doesn’t mean it won’t work.",

    "title": "Elise Stefanik Just Learned Firsthand What Happens When You Trust Trump",
    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nOh, Elise. How did this happen? It profit not a woman to gain the entire world and lose her soul, but for your old congressional seat? To paraphrase Eric Stratton, rush chairman of the Delta Tau Chi chapter at Faber College, hey, you fcked up. You trusted him. From NBC:\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday he was pulling the nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, citing concerns about the House’s slim margin to enact his legislative agenda. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that Stefanik “will stay in Congress” after her nomination for the administration post had stalled for months.\n\n“I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength, and much more, so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “With a very tight Majority, I don’t want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise’s seat. The people love Elise and, with her, we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations. Therefore, Elise will stay in Congress, rejoin the House Leadership Team, and continue to fight for our amazing American People. Speaker Johnson is thrilled!”\n\nAs it happens, Speaker Moses is quaking in his loafers, His majority is paper-thin. He’s got special elections coming up in erstwhile safe Republican districts where the polling numbers are doing things they’ve rarely done before. (The district once represented by Mike Waltz, star of stage, screen, and group chats, is dangerously close.) And the internal polls must look like a cholera epidemic at this point, since the president is nervous enough to stab Stefanik in the back this way while giving the decision the old ALL CAPS hard sell on his failing social media platform. I wish I could say that Stefanik didn’t deserve to be treated like a doormat but, damn, did she deserve to be treated like a doormat.\n\nThe latest offense against history committed by the administration has to do with whitewashing the Smithsonian Institution. Vice President J Divan Vance has been tasked with bringing American history in line with the mandates of creating a white-supremacist nation of the mind again, drawn to the specifications of a tottering old grifter who never knew much history in the first place. From The New York Times:\n\nIn an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” Mr. Trump took aim at what he described as a “revisionist movement” across the country that “seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” His order claimed that the Smithsonian, in particular, had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” and that it promotes “narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.”\n\nIt’s long past time to treat these EOs as the policy suggestions that they are. This, of course, would require a far less supine Congress. How does the president plan to square these requirements with the missions of the National Museum of African American History and Culture or the National Museum of the American Indian or even parts of the Holocaust Memorial Museum? I’m almost afraid to ask.\n\nIn the order he called on Vice President JD Vance, who is a member of the Smithsonian’s board, to work with Congress to prohibit expenditures on exhibitions or programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans by race or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law.” His executive order also called for making sure that the Smithsonian’s American Women’s History Museum, which is under development, does not “recognize men as women in any respect.”\n\nI am now sorry I asked.\n\nIn another passage of the order that could have sweeping implications, Mr. Trump directed the secretary of the Department of the Interior, which oversees the National Park Service, to determine whether, since 2020, “public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior’s jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history.” Instead, the order directs, all properties should “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.”\n\nWelcome back, I suspect, all ye Traitors in Defense of Slavery. Time to rehearse all the lies of the Lost Cause that we learned in grade schools, North and South. Time for history to resume its role as a national anesthetic.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “A Foggy Day” (Germaine Bazzle): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from 1920, some French battle flags from the Franco–Prussian War are returned to the Army Museum in Paris. No sign of meddlesome politicians. History is so cool.\n\nThere were some interesting doings around the Supreme Court this past week. First, the Nine Wise Souls upheld the Biden Administration’s regulations on so-called ghost guns. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority. From SCOTUSBlog:\n\nCongress enacted the Gun Control Act, Gorsuch explained, because it found that then-current “gun control measures … allowed criminals to acquire largely untraceable guns too easily.” The act requires manufacturers to put a serial number on guns and regulates commercial gun sales by (among other things) requiring gun manufacturers and dealers to conduct background checks and keep records of gun sales. Advances in technology, Gorsuch noted, such as 3D printing and reinforced polymers, have changed the way in which guns are manufactured and sold. And in particular, “companies are able to make and sell weapon parts kits that individuals can assemble into functional firearms in their own homes.” These kits are popular among hobbyists, Gorsuch wrote, but also among criminals, because some manufacturers and sellers do not regard them as “firearms” subject to the Gun Control Act and therefore do not comply with the act’s requirements—leading to “an explosion of crimes” around the country.\n\nYou take your sunbeams where they fall these days, and it’s nice to see that the court draws the line at the free manufacture of untraceable firearms. In other action, the court refused to hear a challenge to the 1964 decision in Sullivan v. New York Times, the landmark First Amendment case that raised the standards for libel in connection with public figures—in this case, casino mogul Steve Wynn. From CBS News:\n\nWynn sued the AP in 2018 over its reporting about sexual misconduct allegations against him from the 1970s that were filed with law enforcement. He stepped down from his position as chief executive of Wynn Resorts, which he founded, in 2018, after the Wall Street Journal published sexual misconduct allegations. Wynn also stepped down from his role as the finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. Wynn has consistently denied any allegations of misconduct.\n\nI’m not going to rest easily on this one. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch both are on record as favoring overturning Sullivan. The president wants to burn the decision on the White House steps. Steve Wynn may have been a singularly unattractive plaintiff. My chickens are going to remain uncounted on this one.\n\n\n\nFurther Adventures in Cowardice. From Politico:\n\nThe White House has reached a deal with one of the largest law firms in the world to provide the equivalent of $100 million in free legal work to causes supported by the administration, President Donald Trump announced Friday afternoon. The law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, will also fund fellowships for law school graduates to work on causes in line with the administration’s priorities. The fellows “will represent a wide range of political views, including conservative ideals,” the president said in a statement.\n\nNo expert here, but $100 million seems a lot of money to pay for the right to take on ideological DEI cases. And the administration didn’t even have to threaten these jamokes. Jesus, these people.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From The New York Times:\n\nArchaeologists have unearthed the huge tomb of an unknown pharaoh at an Egyptian necropolis, a team of researchers said on Thursday, in the second discovery of a king’s tomb this year. ... Researchers uncovered the tomb at the mountain, at the base of a high desert cliff where strong winds carry gusts of sand. In some places around the necropolis, sand has buried structures more than 16 or 19 feet deep. The burial chamber features a decorated entryway, several rooms and soaring 16-foot vaults made of mud bricks. It dwarfs a tomb unearthed at Abydos over a decade ago, which was hailed at the time as the first material proof of a “lost” dynasty of kings there.\n\nAn unknown pharaoh, eh? An Egyptian Franklin Pierce. Every country should have one.\n\nHey, NBC News. Is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nDuonychus, which means “two claws” in Greek, stood about 10 feet tall and weighed roughly 570 pounds and belonged to the group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which were characterized by an odd set of traits: huge claws believed to have been used to shear leaves off trees, leaf-shaped teeth, backward-facing hip bones and a long neck ending in a small head, and it was covered in down and quill-like feathers.\n\nThe standards for “an odd set of traits” are a lot higher for dinos than they are for, say, guppies or parakeets. If the scientists find the traits of this new species odd, you can bet that the beast is strange and wonderful.\n\n\n\n“It kind of blew my mind,” the lead author of a study published Tuesday in the journal iScience, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, an associate professor at the Hokkaido University Museum, told NBC News by email. “I felt this rush of excitement, like, ‘Wait … am I actually looking at something completely new here?’ ” Therizinosaurs were already the “weirdest dinosaurs out there,” Kobayashi said. “Duonychus takes that weirdness and pushes it further. It’s like evolution said, ‘Let’s try something different,’ and just ran with it.”\n\nThey lived then to make Dr. Kobayashi happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday for whatever fresh hell awaits. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the earthquakes in Myanmar and Thailand, and by the tornadoes throughout the Southeast, and for everyone touched by floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "By happy accident, or by the intervention of a giddy Deity, on Tuesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee had scheduled its annual national threat assessment hearing. This brought before the committee Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, FBI director Kash Patel, CIA director John Ratcliffe, and a couple of other members of the intelligence community one day after it was revealed that the editor of The Atlantic had been invited to a group chat with most of these people regarding the imminent attack by the United States on Houthi rebels in Yemen. It surely comes as no surprise that the tap-dancing from the witness table was something unseen on TV since the last time TCM ran Singin' In The Rain.\n\nThe general subtext of the testimony was a not-subtle attempt to shift the blame to people who weren't there—to National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and even to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Meanwhile, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were parboiled by Democratic senators as they first tried to dodge the fact that they were on the group chat and, when called on that, they either claimed that there was nothing classified discussed on the chat, or that they couldn't talk about certain subjects because they were, well, classified. Ratcliffe had a particularly hard time; for a CIA director, he didn't seem to have much to do with intelligence, in any sense of the word. First, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado lit him up.\n\nI am curious about whether... did Jeff Goldberg somehow—did he create a hoax that allowed him to become part of this Signal thread? Please answer the question. Don't insult the intelligence of the American people. Did he invite himself to the signal thread?\n\nDir. Ratcliffe: I do not know how he was invited...\n\nThen, Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia asked Ratcliffe simply if the inclusion of Goldberg on the chat was a \"huge mistake.\" Ratcliffe went into a buck-and-wing, denying that the inclusion of the journalist was a \"huge mistake.\" Ossoff went into orbit.\n\nThat was not a huge mistake? They characterized it as an embarrassment. This is utterly unprofessional. There has been no apology. There has been no recognition of the gravity of this error. By the way, we will get the full transcript of this chain and your testimony will be measured carefully against its content.\n\nThis thing is not over. Not by a long shot.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "Every now and again, we check in with the folks at Just Security who are keeping track of the lawsuits currently active against the maladministration of the new American Golden Age. The current tally is 139 and, one suspects, climbing. Many of them make the heretofore unremarkable point that executive orders are in no way laws but, rather, policy recommendations from the executive designed to create a legislative agenda upon which Congress then would act.\n\n(Voice-over: That’s not how it works anymore.)\n\nAt the moment, of course, the administration’s record in the various courts is roughly equivalent to Germany’s in world wars. Which gave Speaker Moses an idea. From Reuters:\n\nJohnson, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, told reporters the numerous injunctions issued by judges nationally that have stymied Trump’s initiatives were part of a “dangerous trend. ... It violates separation of powers when a judge thinks that they can enjoin something that a president is doing, that the American people voted for,” Johnson said during his weekly press conference. He said the House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a hearing next week “to highlight these abuses” and had recently advanced legislation that would prevent district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions blocking policies. “We do have authority over the federal courts,” he said. “As you know, we can eliminate an entire district court. We have power over funding, over the courts and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act.”\n\nNice independent judiciary you have there. Shame if anything happened to it.\n\n(Here is where I note that Speaker Moses seems unbothered by the one-man All U Can Sue wing-nut buffet being run by ol’ Judge Matt Kacsmaryk down in Amarillo.)\n\nJohnson seems prepared to give the contract over to his favorite button man, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Van Heusen), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Any judge subpoenaed by this collection of pantomime kangaroos should refuse to honor them and, if anyone threatens them, say they’ll honor Jordan’s subpoenas when he honors the January 6 select committee’s.

Never forgetting, but forgiving. There is power in forgiving.”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY Salaam with his wife, Sanovia, and their son Yusef Jr. Note Salaam’s ring, which he designed himself to commemorate the exoneration.\n\nSpare a thought for the falsely accused. For the man sent to prison as a boy for something he didn’t do. Does anyone ever allow the reality of a false accusation to sink in and upset the equilibrium for even a moment, or is it just in and out and on to the next, like everything else? That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U. S. A. Spare a thought for the falsely accused.\n\nHe can’t walk down the street for getting stopped by people who have never met him but to whom he is famous. In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\n\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90. Learn more about it, as well as Esquire’s living legacy, in this letter from Editor-in-Chief Michael Sebastian.\n\nA local man who had inherited a real estate fortune even took out full-page ads in all the local papers calling for the state to bring back the death penalty, writing: “What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law . . . ?”\n\nBut that was a lifetime ago, and so some others here in Harlem seem to recognize the falsely accused man not as Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five but as Yusef Salaam, current candidate for public office, running to represent Harlem on the New York City Council. He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\n\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\n\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense. And as he makes his way up and down its streets, from all sides, his fellow Harlemites come to him:\n\n“You know how long it’s been since the senior center had a coat of paint?” says a man holding a cue stick at the Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Center. “And we sure could use another pool table—gives people a place to gather in the evenings. . . .”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY\n\nThis article appeared in the 90th Anniversary issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nA woman buttonholes him at a community meeting at Graham Court, a Gilded Age gem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that has seen better days: “What are you going to do about the defecation and the urination that goes on outside my front door?!”\n\n“I applied for affordable housing, but affordable housing ain’t affordable!” says a man who stops him on 135th Street and comes in for a hug. “We need a two-bedroom, and they’ve had us in a studio for twenty years! . . . I sound Black, right?” He is Asian, and points this out by circling his face with his index finger. “People here don’t look like me, but they sure live like me.” He complains to Salaam about the conduct of corrections officers. “But they just scared. I don’t talk from no textbook—I did fifteen years.” As Salaam begins to walk away to his next appointment, the man reaches out for his hand and issues a plea: “You’ve come too far. Don’t sell yourself out.”\n\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\n\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\n\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\n\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\n\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\n\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\n\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\n\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\n\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\n\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\n\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\n\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\n\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\n\nThe air between them bristles.\n\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\n\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\n\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\n\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\n\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\n\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\n\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\n\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\n\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\n\nYoung man: Then what are you?\n\nSalaam: I’m you.\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\n\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\n\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\n\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\n\nThe Central Park Six.\n\nThe Central Park Five.\n\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\n\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\n\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\n\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\n\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\n\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\n\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\n\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\n\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\n\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\n\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\n\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\n\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\n\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\n\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\n\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\n\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\n\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\n\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\n\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\n\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\n\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\n\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\n\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\n\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\n\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\n\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\n\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\n\n\n\nStory: Mark Warren\n\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\n\nStyling: Bill Mullen\n\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\n\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\n\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\n\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\n\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\n\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\n\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "That election result in Wisconsin certainly gave us a few days of comfort and joy. But less encouraging events are afoot in the Tar Heel State.\n\nCaution: Mellow Harshing, Next Right.\n\nFrom WRAL in Raleigh:\n\nThousands of North Carolina voters could soon have their 2024 ballots thrown out, the state Court of Appeals ruled Friday in a case that could flip to Republicans another seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court months after the November election. If the ruling stands, the State Board of Elections would be required to ask more than 60,000 voters to provide proof of their identity. Anyone who doesn’t respond will have their ballot thrown out—an outcome that could tilt the narrow race for the high-court seat in favor of the Republican candidate, Jefferson Griffin, who challenged the ballots.\n\nGriffin, who is a judge on the Court of Appeals, challenged Democratic incumbent Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs for her seat on the high court in the 2024 election. Recounts showed that Riggs received 734 more votes than Griffin. But the winner of the race hasn’t been made official, while Griffin challenges the voters’ registration and the validity of their ballots. Riggs, who has joined the state board in the lawsuit, said Friday that she would fight the ruling. “We will be promptly appealing this deeply misinformed decision that threatens to disenfranchise more than 65,000 lawful voters and sets a dangerous precedent, allowing disappointed politicians to thwart the will of the people,” she said in a statement.\n\nWe in the shebeen have been following this one for a while. Tracking it has been easy because this case stinks like week-old mackerel. What Griffin wants, literally, is that the rules of the election be changed ex post facto. The lone Democrat on the appeals court, Judge Toby Hampson, pointed this out in a barbed dissent.\n\nHampson wrote that the voters followed every rule they were told to during the election, and that Griffin shouldn’t be allowed to change the rules after the fact to throw out their ballots. “Changing the rules by which these lawful voters took part in our electoral process after the election to discard their otherwise valid votes in an attempt to alter the outcome of only one race among many on the ballot is directly counter to law, equity, and the Constitution,” Hampson wrote. “Make no mistake: should the majority’s decision be implemented, the impact will be to disenfranchise North Carolina voters even though they were eligible to vote on election day.”\n\nIn other words, the voters whose eligibility is being challenged voted according to the rules that prevailed at the time, and Griffin is arguing that the rules should be different now that the election is over. This is not how this is supposed to work.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican majority on the appeals court seems to have taken up permanent residence in that magical land where lives Justice Samuel Alito—a place where the law exists in a sweet-smelling vacuum beyond the daily lives of ordinary Americans and far from the sweaty tribulations of vile politics.\n\nThe judges wrote Friday that they weren’t swayed by arguments that Griffin selectively challenged only some voters and that his effort was motivated less by a concern for election integrity and more by a desire to win the election. “The Court is not concerned with the race, sex, age, or party affiliation of any contested voter or the outcome,” the ruling states.\n\nAnd I, as you know, am the Tsar of all the Russias.\n\nSuddenly, Riggs, who won the election and who has prevailed in two recounts, and who has been fighting off all the legal challenges brought by Griffin, has a long pull up a dirt road. The voters Griffin is trying to disenfranchise have 15 business days to bring their paperwork into alignment with the rules that apply now, five months after the election. This is not how anything is supposed to work.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "The fallout from the revelation by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic that he had been inadvertently “read into” a meeting on the Signal app at which the administration’s plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen were discussed continues to fall like sandbags in an old vaudeville routine. Government bouffe is all the rage in Beltway entertainment these days.\n\nThe Commonwealth’s (God save it!) daily communicant at the Church of the Perpetually Ambitious, Rep. Seth Moulton, waxed profound:\n\nThere is no world in which this information should have been shared in non-secure channels.\n\nSenator Professor Warren had questions:\n\nOur national security is in the hands of complete amateurs. What other highly sensitive national security conversations are happening over group chat? Any other random people accidentally added to those, too?\n\nFormer Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg was moved to discreet profanity:\n\nFrom an operational security perspective, this is the highest level of f‑‑‑up imaginable. To see this administration claiming that it cares about competence and merit and then be responsible for an epic f‑‑‑up like this demonstrates that these are not serious people. ... This kind of intelligence failure calls the question on whether there is any place for merit or competence in this administration at all. Because if there are not highly serious consequences for this level of screwup, then it will make clear that all of the bluster about merit that you hear about from this White House is just bullshit. We deserve so much better than this.\n\nAnd Hillary Rodham Clinton was moved to succinctness:\n\nYou have got to be kidding me.\n\nIn the face of all this criticism, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who swears he’s doing all this stuff sober, responded in fluent FoxSpeak, that strange dialect understood by angry shut-ins all over America.\n\nSo you’re talking about a Deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again to include the, I don’t know, the hoaxes of Russia, Russia, Russia, or the fine people on both sides hoax or suckers and losers hoax. So this is the guy that peddles in garbage. This is what he does. I would love to comment on the Houthi campaign. Because of the skill and courage of our troops, I’ve monitored it very closely from the beginning, and you see, we’ve been managing 4 years of deferred maintenance under the Trump administration. Our troops, our sailors were getting shot at as targets. Our ships couldn’t sail through. And when they did shoot back, it was purely defensively or at shacks in Yemen. President Trump said no more. We will reestablish deterrence. We will open freedom of navigation. And we will ultimately decimate the Houthis, which is exactly what we’re doing as we speak from the beginning overwhelmingly details.\n\nI feel safe in my assumption that Secretary Hegseth wouldn’t know Jeffrey Goldberg if he sat in his lap. So what we got from the secretary as regards one of the most hilariously obvious exercises in incompetence was a tangle of Trumpian conjuring words designed to make all the scandals disappear. And some tough-guy posturing that was effective on the couch with Harris Faulkner but that is Punch-and-Judy bafflegab in the real world.\n\nAnd the president?\n\nI don’t know anything about it. I’m not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it’s a magazine that’s going out of business.\n\nWhere are the clowns?\n\nDon’t bother. They’re here.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "I hung in there as long as I could on Monday night, but Senator Cory Booker outlasted me. And he was still going when I got up Tuesday morning. And he’s still going as I type this post. He has moved on to shaming the House conservatives for their fiscal cruelty and irresponsibility. (Yeah, good luck with that.) What Booker is doing is not technically a filibuster since Booker is not holding up action on a specific bill. But with the help of questions from his Democratic colleagues, Booker is holding the floor, as is his right as a senator, and he is rounding into his 15th hour, and there is no damage being done to the republic from that quarter, so that’s a good thing.\n\nHe’s moved on to shaming conservative Republicans for sucking up to the guy who sucks up to Vladimir Putin by demolishing NATO. Yeah, good luck with that.\n\nSometimes it’s necessary to just stand up against the momentum. Way back in 1964, before the Sixties really got rolling, a guy named Mario Savio stood on the steps of Sproul Hall on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley and talked about what is to be done when all else fails.\n\nThere’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can’t take part! You can’t even passively take part! And you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus—and you’ve got to make it stop! And you’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it—that unless you’re free the machine will be prevented from working at all!\n\nCory Booker is putting his body on the gears of the United States Senate because the operation of that machine has become too odious to do anything else. Now he’s talking with Senator Chris Coons about U.S. efforts at helping Africa fight against epidemic disease. Yeah, good luck with that.\n\n(He’s also having fun saying, “Ouagadougou,” the capital of Burkina Faso. He’s entitled to have some fun.)\n\nThe elite political media largely have managed not to notice what Booker is doing. It has escaped the notice of the keepers of Politico’s front page. The New York Times buried it beneath tariffs, the latest vandalism out of the White House, and the race for a seat on the Wisconsin supreme court, as did The Washington Post. Nevertheless, Cory Booker is now talking about how the president has no respect for the people his policies will hurt. Yeah, good luck with that.\n\nWe are coming up on the 250th anniversary of our revolutionary birth. There are going to be a lot of commemorations over the next decade, beginning this month at Lexington and Concord here in the Commonwealth (God save it!). We will play a big role in the celebrations until the action moves to Philadelphia next year. But the real commemoration began in 2023, when we celebrated the 250th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, to which even that stick-in-the-mud John Adams gave respect.\n\nThis is the most magnificent Movement of all. There is a Dignity, a Majesty, a Sublimity, in this last Effort of the Patriots, that I greatly admire. The People should never rise, without doing something to be remembered—something notable And striking.\n\nThat is the spirit pushing Cory Booker toward his 20th hour, putting his body on the levers and trying for something notable and striking, and now he’s talking about the threat to Social Security. Yeah, good luck with that.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "One of the regular tropes from our previous exercise in self-destruction that I kept handy was the fact that the claim that “we hire only the best people” never would stop being funny. Now that we’re deep into Hell’s Encore, it’s time to trot it out again, with the caveat that it isn’t as funny the second time around. From The Washington Post:\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has hired David Geier to conduct the analysis, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Geier and his father, Mark Geier, have published papers claiming vaccines increase the risk of autism, a theory that has been studied for decades and scientifically debunked. David Geier was disciplined by Maryland regulators more than a decade ago for practicing medicine without a license. He is listed as a data analyst in the HHS employee directory.\n\nThere is, of course, absolutely no need for any study of whether vaccines cause autism. They don’t. And if you need proof, there are only a couple hundreds studies debunking the whole notion you can look up. But if you’re going to form a committee to study a nonexistent medical phenomenon, who better than a non-doctor to head it up?\n\n“It seems the goal of this administration is to prove that vaccines cause autism, even though they don’t,” said Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds autism research. “They are starting with the conclusion and looking to prove it. That’s not how science is done.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have repeatedly linked vaccines to autism. Kennedy has often cited studies by David Geier and his father, a physician, asserting that their research reveals the negative effects of vaccines. ...\n\n... During Kennedy’s confirmation hearings, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) pressed Kennedy to publicly disavow his past claims about vaccines and autism. Kennedy replied he would do so if presented with data disproving the link, despite the overwhelming body of research that already does.\n\nOf course, Cassidy, a real doctor, voted for Kennedy’s nomination anyway, because Hippocrates never had to worry about a future primary.\n\nEntrusting the nation’s health to a notorious quack already is having nationwide consequences. The measles epidemic in west Texas rages on despite the fact that Kennedy’s Patent Medicine Wagon rolled into town weeks ago. From The New York Times:\n\nParents in Gaines County, Texas, the center of a raging measles outbreak, have increasingly turned to supplements and unproven treatments to protect their children, many of whom are unvaccinated, against the virus. One of those supplements is cod liver oil containing vitamin A, which Mr. Kennedy has promoted as a near miraculous cure for measles. Physicians at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, say they’ve now treated a handful of unvaccinated children who were given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage. Some of them had received unsafe doses of cod liver oil and other vitamin A supplements for several weeks in an attempt to prevent a measles infection, said Dr. Summer Davies, who cares for acutely ill children at the hospital.\n\nChristamighty, I can see the medical examiner’s report now: “Cause of Death: Did Own Research on Internet.”",

    "content": "I honestly don’t know whether I believe the stories that cropped up so suddenly on Wednesday afternoon about how Elon Musk will be leaving the administration, sources say. Certainly the voters of Wisconsin demonstrated quite vividly what a political millstone the guy has become. (As near as I can tell, nobody likes this strange Porcelain Man.) His primary business venture has gone into the blind downward staggers. And the man has the essential personal charm of a carcinogenic pesticide. Even the president, it seems, is said to have tumbled to what a huge liability the man has become.\n\nAll of my skepticism is based on the fact that I don’t trust anyone in this administration as far as I can throw a gilded commode. This includes anyone speaking anonymously “to avoid reprisals,” or whatever the rhetorical chickenshit of the day is. It would be a classic John Barron ploy to float the notion without actually doing anything about it.\n\nAnd even if it is true, so what? His damage is already done, and it will take years, if not decades, to repair it. Who needs a friendless goofball dressed up like Zorro to decimate the government when you have people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to do it piecemeal for you? The day-to-day functions of government have been handed over to people who don’t believe government should function, day-to-day or, possibly, at all. Trumpism has evolved completely into Muskism, and it needs neither Trump nor Musk to wreak its havoc.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "Never let it be said that our big ship of fools doesn’t know how to multitask. While busy lighting the entire 20th century on fire, starting with the national economy, it also finds the time to whitewash the history of the country generally, in ways both grand and petty. From The Washington Post:\n\nFor years, a National Park Service webpage introduced the Underground Railroad with a large photograph of its most famous “conductor,” Harriet Tubman. “The Underground Railroad—the resistance to enslavement through escape and flight, through the end of the Civil War—refers to the efforts of enslaved African Americans to gain their freedom by escaping bondage,” the page began. Tubman’s photograph is now gone. In its place are images of Postal Service stamps that highlight “Black/White cooperation” in the secret network and that feature Tubman among abolitionists of both races.\n\nThe introductory sentence is gone, too. It has been replaced by a line that makes no mention of slavery and that describes the Underground Railroad as “one of the most significant expressions of the American civil rights movement.” The effort “bridged the divides of race,” the page now says.\n\nThat must have been why Ms. Tubman carried a pistol, to help her bridge the divides of race.\n\nSome were edited to remove references to slavery. On other pages, statements on the historic struggle of Black Americans for their rights were cut or softened, as were references to present-day echoes of racial division. The Post compared webpages as of late March to earlier versions preserved online by the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Changes in images, descriptions and even individual words have subtly reshaped the meaning of notable moments and key figures dating to the nation’s founding—abolitionist John Brown’s doomed raid, the battle at Appomattox and school integration by the Little Rock Nine. ...\n\n... A statement about the legacy of John Brown, who hoped to start a revolt by enslaved people in the run-up to the Civil War, was removed from a page on the website of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park in West Virginia. “John Brown’s complex legacy remains a powerful symbol in America’s ongoing dialogue on race, justice, and the fight against oppression,” the line said.\n\nJohn Brown, of course, engaged in America’s ongoing dialogue on race with a broadsword one night in Kansas. And making deletions on the Harpers Ferry website is tantamount to removing George Washington’s name at Yorktown. Some of the cargo-shorts crew running the DOGE and pony show should’ve paid some attention in history class. Of course, it’s possible that they were busy daydreaming about raising tariffs on penguin islands off Antarctica.",

    "title": "Bernie Sanders Tried to Block Arms Sales to Israel and Got Almost No Support",
    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "Tell me how any of this makes sense.\n\nOn Friday, in addition to blowing things up in Syria and threatening Turkey, which we will leave aside for the moment, Israel once again made the rubble bounce in Gaza, killing 17 more people, a day after it killed 100 people, many of them at a school that was being used as a temporary shelter.\n\nFrom the outside, it would appear to me that Israel has all the munitions it needs to conduct whatever military options it chooses to undertake and that this might be an opportune time for the United States to use any future arms sales as leverage to control its ally so that it’s at least not blowing up schools where kids are sheltering while things are blowing up outside. Nevertheless, when Senator Bernie Sanders tried to block a pending $8 billion arms sale to Israel, he did so practically alone. Only 14 other senators, all Democrats, voted with him. Senator Cory Booker, recently minted hero of the resistance, was not one of them.\n\nWhy in God’s name does Israel need $8 billion more worth of weaponry? Why is this country making criticism of an ally in a college newspaper (!) a cause for deportation? Why are demonstrations against one specific foreign-policy issue being used as a club to batter respected universities into line with a president’s lunatic agenda on so many other issues? How does any of this make sense at all? How in the name of God did we get here?\n\n\n\nI, too, am more than amused by the fact that the president levied tariffs on uninhabited islands and penguin breeding grounds and even on poor Tuvalu, which is well on its way to being a lagoon in the south Pacific. But then there are places like Lesotho, and things are not as funny as they used to be. Lesotho is a mountainous, landlocked country completely surrounded by South Africa. Some 2.6 million people live there. It has become a manufacturing haven for the garment industry. From The Guardian:\n\nAccording to the African Growth and Opportunities Act (Agoa) US data portal, Lesotho exported $237m of goods last year to the US and imported $2.8m. Agoa, which has allowed tariff-free access to the US market for thousands of product types since 2000, created a thriving garment industry, accounting for about 20% of GDP. There are about 30,000 garment workers in Lesotho, mostly women, with 12,000 making clothes for US brands including Levi’s, Calvin Klein and Walmart in Chinese- and Taiwanese-owned factories. While most of the jobs pay the monthly minimum wage of $146-$163, they are still highly sought after in the poor, largely informal economy.\n\nOn Liberation Day last Wednesday, the president slapped a 50 percent “reciprocal” tariff on Lesotho. It was the highest rate levied against any country.\n\nThe tariff rates, which are due to come into force on 9 April, range from 10% to 50% and were calculated with what economists labelled an “idiotic” formula, penalising countries that have the highest trade surpluses with the US relative to their imports from the US. Dr Ratjomose Machema, a lecturer in economics at the National University of Lesotho, said: “I don’t understand how this is a reciprocal tariff because we really don’t charge that much in tariffs.”\n\nEconomists are not wondering if Lesotho’s economy will survive. They’re wondering if the country will. From NBC News:\n\nLesotho, which Trump described in March as a country “nobody has ever heard of,” is one of the world’s poorest nations with a gross domestic product of just over $2 billion. It has a large trade surplus with the United States, mostly made up of diamonds and textiles, including Levi’s jeans. Its exports to the United States, which in 2024 totalled $237 million, account for more than 10% of its GDP. Oxford Economics said the textile sector, with some 40,000 workers, was Lesotho’s biggest private employer and accounted for roughly 90% of manufacturing employment and exports. “Then you are having retailers who are selling food. And then you have residential property owners who are renting houses for the workers. So this means if the closure of factories were to happen, the industry is going to die and there will be multiplier effects,” Lesotho Private Sector Foundation CEO Thabo Qhesi said. “So Lesotho will be dead, so to say.”\n\nHappy Liberation Day to all who celebrate.\n\n\n\nIt is my considered opinion that anyone who describes themselves as an “influencer” as though that were a genuine occupation ought to be signed over to a Middlesex County road crew until they recognize a real job when they see it. At the very least, these nuisances should leave the planet’s reclusive Indigenous tribes the fck alone. From the BBC:\n\nMykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov, 24, allegedly landed on North Sentinel Island in an apparent attempt to make contact with the isolated Sentinelese tribe, filming his visit and leaving a can of coke and a coconut on the shore. Survival International, a group that advocates for the rights of tribal people, said the alleged act endangered the man’s own life and the lives of the tribe, calling it “deeply disturbing”. The US said it was aware and “monitoring the situation”.\n\n\n\nThe police chief told AFP: “A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.” It is illegal for foreigners or Indians to travel within 5km (three miles) of the islands in order to protect the people living there.\n\nAccording to police, Mr Polyakov has visited the region twice before—including using an inflatable kayak in October last year before he was stopped by hotel staff. On his arrest earlier this week, the man told police he was a “thrill seeker”, Indian media reported.\n\nSomebody should advise the islanders to slap a 25 percent reciprocal tariff on Americans like Vasco da Jackass here.\n\n\n\nIf you’re making a dive for the wing-nut spotlight, it’s important to keep the bit going even if the rest of the breathing world has come to believe you to be an irredeemable dickhead. Jim Banks is a rookie senator from Indiana. He needs to come out smoking to leap into the higher levels of conservative dickhead-ism. From the Hill:\n\nThe viral video showed former HHS employee Mack Schroeder approaching Banks in a Senate office building on Tuesday and asking him about the mass layoffs at HHS. Schroeder, who noted that he personally was among the fired HHS employees, asked the senator how he would ensure residents in his state got the services they needed. “You probably deserved it,” Banks told Schroeder, referring to Schroeder’s termination. When Schroeder asked why, Banks told him, “Because you seem like a clown.”\n\nCue the next 12 years of fundraising videos and speaking fees. Sign him up for his designated recliner in the Fox News green room.\n\nBanks, in a video posted to the social platform X on Wednesday, further dug his heels in, refusing to “back down” from his position. “The Democrats and the left-wing media have lost their minds because I told a left-wing activist in the halls of the Senate office buildings yesterday what I really thought: A clown is a clown, who’s chasing senators through the halls with a cellphone, complaining about losing a left-wing woke job in the federal government that should have never been a job to begin with,” Banks said in the video Wednesday. “I won’t back down. I won’t apologize for it,” he continued. “I support President Trump and the DOGE effort 100 percent to cut wasteful spending and woke jobs out of the federal government, and we’re just getting started.”\n\nBanks might be interested to know that hundreds of people demonstrated against the HHS Medicaid cuts in Indianapolis this week, and also against the state’s jumping on the cut-and-slash bandwagon. Or that, between the Republican administration in Washington and the one in Indianapolis—and right-wing, well, clownishness—Indiana public health is a mess. The state university, to name only one source, is less than impressed. From The Indianapolis Recorder:\n\nSimultaneously, Gov. Mike Braun has introduced measures aimed at making health care more affordable. However, these measures include significant cuts to public health funding and reductions in Medicaid access for low-income residents. Critics argue that these cuts contradict promises to improve health care accessibility and transparency, potentially undermining efforts to enhance health care access for Hoosiers.\n\nThese funding reductions come at a time when Indiana is already grappling with declining vaccination rates. Between 2019 and 2023, the state’s average immunization rate for children fell from 72% to 56.4%, according to the Indiana Department of Health. This decline raises concerns about the potential resurgence of preventable diseases. The loss of federal funding could exacerbate these challenges by limiting resources available for vaccination outreach and education programs. Public health experts emphasize the importance of rebuilding trust in immunizations and ensuring that vaccines remain accessible to all Hoosiers.\n\nThere are clowns back home, Senator, putting all their neighbors at risk. You know them. You campaigned for them in the House and when you ran for Senate. Go talk to them. Clown.\n\n\n\nOkay, it’s time for us to hang up the halo we put on Mike Pence for doing his job on January 6, 2021. He’s still the half-bright theocrat who thought he was salvaging his dying career by signing on with El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago. And certainly there’s no reason for him to win the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in 2025 for something he did five years ago. Surely there have been Profiles in Courage since then. Hell, between Cory Booker and Judge James Boasberg, there have been two worthy Profiles in Courage just in the past month. Do better, Kennedys. You have enough problems with the brand already.\n\n\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Ain’t It Crazy” (Lightnin’ Hopkins): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from 1938, is Secretary of State—not “Foreign Secretary,” ya ig’nant Brits—Cordell Hull celebrating a new trade deal between the United States and the UK and Canada. I don’t know if “all Americans” were happy about it, but Hull seems to be having the time of his life. (By the way, Cordell Hull has a place on my list of Great Names of American White People. Other entrants include Elihu Root and Thurlow Weed.) History is so cool.\n\n\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look what we found! From MSN:\n\nThe discovery was made at a vacant lot in the Lincolnville neighborhood of St. Augustine, close to downtown. The team with the City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program discovered what they believe is archaeological evidence of a small British fort, known as a redoubt. ... According to maps and historic documents, there were seven of these British redoubts in St. Augustine when Florida was a British colony in the 1700s.\n\nArchaeologist Katherine Sims said there’s evidence the redoubt was built in 1781. She even pointed to it on two different historical maps. “However, in every map, it’s in a slightly different place and they’re all different shapes,” Sims noted. “Which has contributed to why it’s been so hard to find them archaeologically.” So what happened to that redoubt? It was only built two years before the British pulled out of St. Augustine and Florida became a colony of Spain again. White said there’s no real documentation that the Spanish even used the British redoubts in the western part of St. Augustine.\n\nPersonally, I believe the Brits disappeared because of a lethal sunburn outbreak at the end of the 18th century.\n\nHey, BBC, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nHuge meat-eating dinosaurs and their plant-eating prey shared the same watering holes on Skye 167 million years ago, say scientists. University of Edinburgh researchers examined dozens of dinosaur footprints at Prince Charles’s Point on the island’s Trotternish Peninsula. The dinosaurs included carnivorous megalosaurs—ancestors of Tyrannosaurus rex—and long necked herbivores that were up to three times bigger in size than an elephant. The scientists analysed the footprints to understand how the animals had moved, and suggested the different dinosaurs had “milled around” shallow freshwater lagoons.\n\nTo explain this phenomenon, we contacted noted naturalist and African explorer, Captain Geoffrey Spaulding:\n\nThe principal animals inhabiting the African jungle are moose, elks and Knights of Pythias. Of course, you all know what a moose is. That’s big game. The first day, I shot two bucks. That was the biggest game we had. As I say, you all know what a moose is? A moose runs around on the floor, and eats cheese, and is chased by the cats. The elks, on the other hand live up in the hills, and in the spring they come down for their annual convention. It is very interesting to watch them come to the water hole. And you should see them run when they find it is only a water hole. What they’re looking for is an al-co-hole (or elk-a-hole). One morning, I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don’t know. Then we tried to remove the tusks. The tusks. That’s not so easy to say, tusks. You try that some time. ... As I say, we tried to remove the tusks, but they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn’t budge them. Of course, in Alabama, the Tusk-a-loosa.\n\nSo it was back in the day, too, when they lived then to make us happy now.",

    "content": "I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\n\n\n\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\n\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\n\n\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\n\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\n\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "Operation Shakedown has finally reached the banks of the Charles, as we all knew it would—if not inevitably, then certainly when Columbia University prostrated itself in front of the administration’s button men. From The Boston Globe:\n\nThe announcement comes 10 days after the task force secured extraordinary concessions from Columbia University in a similar review that placed nearly $5 billion of that school’s federal funding at risk. Directly targeting Harvard is a significant escalation in the Trump administration’s crackdown on elite universities and what it describes as their failure to protect Jewish students from antisemitism and harassment. That campaign also includes arresting and threatening to deport international students linked to the pro-Palestinian campus movement, such as a Tufts University graduate student who was arrested in Somerville last week.\n\nIf the republic is very lucky, we may one day discover how Columbia came to be so cowardly and stupid as to give in to what is quite obviously administration extortion. Until then, let’s all agree that this has as much to do with anti-Semitism as it does with the periodic table of elements. This is about the breaking of institutions wealthy enough to resist the rising power of an authoritarian plutocracy. For example, here’s premier education vandal Christopher Rufo, who’s already done so much to resegregate American higher education. Rufo has made a good living off the essential cowardice of said institutions. He began by creating bogeymen out of critical race theory and DEI programs. He’s been busy, busy again.\n\nChristopher Rufo, an influential conservative activist, urged the Trump administration last week to “export the new Columbia prototype to all universities—starting with those in the Ivy League.”\n\nWhy? The protests over the invasion of Gaza occurred all over the country. Two of the most conspicuously violent of them occurred at the University of California at Berkeley and at UCLA. (A study published by an independent nonprofit concluded that 97 percent of the demonstrations were not violent at all.) And the use to which the administration has put those demonstrations—and the accusations of anti-Semitism—is almost unfathomably cynical. Accosting and disappearing university students in broad daylight for contributing essays to campus newspapers decrying the activities of a foreign government would be comical if the government were not actually doing it. It’s about gathering power here, not bombs dropping there.\n\nThe answer is obvious. The Ivy League is, rightly or wrongly, considered to be a collection of the nation’s most elite universities. They are wealthy and influential. Their alumni are some of the most powerful individuals in the country. And Harvard is the preeminent brand among the Ivies. It is a very tempting target for Rufo and this administration’s wrecking crew. They have announced their intention to make a target out of Harvard, and the ball is now in the university’s court.\n\nAnd if Harvard is what Harvard always has said it is, Operation Shakedown should stop at its gates. No cooperation. No concessions. No surrender. At north of $50 billion, Harvard has the largest endowment of any university in the world. Of all American universities, Harvard is best equipped for outright resistance. All it will take is that the university stand firm, and that its donors do the same. Fight fiercely, Hah-vid. It’s time to live up to your rep.",

The president has reacted as the national leader we have come to know. From The Washington Post:\n\nMills was “disrespectful” and “unprofessional” during an event with President Donald Trump, wrote Leland Dudek in a Feb. 27 email viewed by The Washington Post. While canceling the contracts meant that “improper payments will go up,” Dudek wrote, it would also deny federal funds to a “petulant child.”\n\nThe move to cut a key service for new parents and a system that allows quick reporting of deaths—later reversed—was one of a series of measures targeting Maine taken by federal agencies following a brief but pointed exchange between Trump and Mills during a National Governors Association event at the White House on Feb. 21. At the gathering, Trump demanded that Maine comply with his executive order banning transgender athletes from women’s sports. Mills replied that Maine would follow state and federal law. Trump threatened to cut off all funding to the state. “See you in court,” Mills responded.\n\nMills was standing up for her constituents and for Maine’s antidiscrimination statutes against the administration’s absurd attacks on trans citizens, particularly high school athletes. Dudek is the interim director of the Social Security Administration, which makes him the perfect vehicle for petty presidential vendettas. Which pretty much occupies most of the administration’s time.\n\nSince that one-minute interaction, the small New England state has been subjected to unusual, overlapping investigations and arbitrary reversals of funding, turning it into a test case for the Trump administration’s approach to perceived adversaries. Officials in Maine have spent weeks in a state of “whiplash and worry,” in the words of one educator, hit with probes that are unlike anything experts say they have seen.\n\nThere has been a concerted effort to turn the vengeance off, which largely has been successful, thanks to Maine’s U.S. senator Susan Collins, she of the deeply furrowed brow. But the president’s lizard brain never sleeps.\n\nOther apparent consequences for the state have left officials bewildered. A week after Trump and Mills faced off, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sent a letter saying that funding for Maine Sea Grant, a 54-year-old marine research and education program, was being canceled because it “was no longer relevant” to the government’s “priorities and program objectives.”\n\nMaine Sea Grant is one of 34 such programs around the country; none of the others were terminated. The letter ending the $4.5 million grant was sent as hundreds of people were gathered at a hotel in Rockport for the annual Fishermen’s Forum conference.\n\nI’m not sure why any officials should be “bewildered.” The governor harshed the president’s mellow in public. Unless one is a former KGB operative with his own nuclear arsenal and a fondness for upper-floor windows, you don’t get to do that. Time for Maine to strike back. Complete lobster boycott of all Trump properties. Let ’em eat whitefish.\n\nWe move along to Utah, where the state legislature recently was granted a singular honor by the Society of Professional Journalists, which declared it to be the least transparent such body in the country. Utah Proud!\n\nAmong the most egregious examples: In 2022, the Legislature voted to prevent the release of Garrity statements, which are compelled statements from public employees during internal investigations. This move followed a request from The Salt Lake Tribune for records related to a fatal officer-involved shooting.\n\nIn 2023, lawmakers passed a law shielding officials’ digital calendars from public view. This came after journalists sought access to Attorney General Sean Reyes’ calendar amid scrutiny of his connections to Tim Ballard, the controversial former CEO of Operation Underground Railroad. Even when courts ordered the calendar’s release, a new law blocked access.\n\nIn 2025, the Legislature passed SB277, a law proposing to replace the independent State Records Committee with a single administrative law judge appointed by the governor. Despite public outcry, the measure threatens to concentrate authority over public records decisions, further reducing accountability.\n\nThe Legislature also passed HB69, which prevents citizens from recovering attorney fees when challenging the government for public records, without public hearings or input. Together with SB277, this makes it harder for individuals and organizations with limited resources to access withheld records.\n\nThat’s breaking a lot of rock to prevent your constituents from finding out what’s really going on. I mean, Louisiana I can buy. Maryland, Illinois, absolutely. Even the Commonwealth (God save it!). But Utah? My disillusionment is endless.\n\nWe move on to Delaware, which is having a severe dead-whale problem these days. From The News Journal:\n\n“The boat was not large enough to be able to handle that kind of weight,” said Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Executive Director Suzanne Thurman. “The challenge is that it’s so shallow in the bays, so the size boat that’s needed can’t get back there. We’re back to the drawing board.” It’s the third dead whale to wash up on Delaware shores this year. A juvenile humpback beached itself and died just north of the Indian River Inlet, in Delaware Seashore State Park on Thursday, March 13. Around Feb. 28, a dead juvenile fin whale washed up in the mud at Pigeon Point, just north of the Delaware Memorial Bridge in New Castle County.\n\nThe story includes a hotline for people who see deceased sea life in and around Delaware. I am currently contemplating an associated hotline to solicit cheap wisecracks about the current secretary of health and human services.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Consul General to Portugal Friedman of the Plains brings us the Further Adventures of Ryan Walters, Busybody of the Lord:\n\n“Oklahoma will never be bullied by radical, out-of-state atheists who use intimidation and harassment against kids,” said Walters. “The Freedom From Religion Foundation has no stake in our schools, no authority over our communities, and absolutely no right to trample on the First Amendment. Their threats are nothing more than a desperate attempt to erase faith from public life, and we will fight them at every turn.”\n\nThe lawsuit was prompted by the FFRF’s having sent a cease-and-desist letter in regards to how Achille Public Schools allowed a student to pray over the intercom.\n\nA mighty deposition is our Lord.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.",

    "content": "Speaker Moses appears to be following the Exodus template very closely. Now, it seems, we are up to the wandering 40 years aimlessly in the desert part. He has lost control of his majority and, for the moment, the entire House of Representatives. He is being beaten like a rented mule by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, of all people, not the brightest bulb in the chamber’s chandelier. And he is losing on an issue that he never saw coming. Perhaps the bush was burning too brightly.\n\nAn internal GOP fight over whether new parents serving in the House should be able to cast votes by proxy has metastasized into a battle of wills between competing factions of Republicans. The showdown culminated in a stunning vote Tuesday where nine Republicans joined with Democrats to reject Johnson’s move to block the proxy-voting proposal. Johnson responded by sending lawmakers home for the week, skipping planned votes on election integrity, judicial overreach and other key GOP priorities. Now he is scrambling to find an off-ramp as he pledges to finish work next week on a fiscal blueprint for their sprawling party-line agenda.\n\nAt issue is a bipartisan bill that would allow new parents in the House to use proxy voting for 12 weeks after their children are born. So in an unprecedented feat of legislative legerdemain, Johnson has managed to take a nice little perk for new mommies and daddies and turn it into a massive roadblock to the entire Republican legislative agenda.\n\nPublicly, he doubled down Wednesday on his opposition to Rep. Anna Paulina Luna’s proxy-voting effort. The Florida Republican recruited several GOP colleagues to sign a discharge petition, successfully circumventing Johnson to force a floor vote. Behind the scenes, however, he has been in frequent contact with Luna negotiating other potential legislative options in an attempt to unjam the House floor, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss the private conversation.\n\nJohnson said Wednesday he was “actively working on every possible accommodation to make Congressional service simpler for young mothers.” By evening, he suggested a breakthrough was close.“I think there may be a path through this,” Johnson told reporters. “We’re trying to work through and resolve it in a way that satisfies everybody. So I think we can do that.” At stake is not only Johnson’s control of the House floor, but also the GOP’s tight timeline for advancing their closely watched megabill. Senate Republicans on Wednesday released a revised budget blueprint—a key intermediate step—and planned to work into the weekend to approve it. Johnson reiterated in a separate interview he wants the House to give it final approval next week.\n\nIt’s a magical time in American politics.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "The Department of Health and Human Services, headed incomprehensibly by one of the greatest weirdos ever to occupy a position of power in this country, has surrendered to patent medicines, hot and cold running PFAS, and various strains of hemorrhagic fever. From CNN:\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said last week that 10,000 full-time employees would be cut on top of thousands who had already left and probationary employees currently on leave. He said the changes would make fighting chronic disease the priority and reduce “bureaucratic sprawl.” Kennedy promised that the department would do more with less.\n\nKennedy said in a social media post that the agency is being “recalibrated to emphasize prevention, not just sick care. ... This is a difficult moment for all of us at HHS. Our hearts go out to those who have lost their jobs,” he wrote. “But the reality is clear: what we’ve been doing isn’t working.”\n\nThe entire public health infrastructure is stripped for parts, and all its institutional memory has gone up the spout, and this guy sounds like the assistant manager of a convenience store firing the employee who never got the hang of the Slurpee machine. We are truly in the hands of the madmen now.\n\n“It’s a bloodbath,” one US Food and Drug Administration employee said. “These cuts to agency experts and programs leave our country less safe, less prepared and without the necessary talent and resources to respond to health threats,” Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Biden administration, said Tuesday.\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn, former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said, “The FDA as we’ve known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed. ... If we let down our guard and don’t do a good job reviewing, we’re going to unleash some things that are really dangerous into the population. Unless there’s some super plan, there’s going to be an effect on safety, because it takes whole teams of people to monitor safety of products, and the timetables for product review will probably be delayed.”\n\nI’m not sure what Mr. Secretary would consider a “super plan.” I am very sure that I don’t want to know.\n\nThe totality of the cuts was not clear Tuesday, with many workers waiting for emails—or waiting to get into buildings, uncertain whether their badges would work. Even supervisors weren’t sure who was being eliminated, one senior official at the CDC said. Cuts at the CDC slashed divisions that work on workplace health and safety, HIV, injury prevention, reproductive health, smoking and violence prevention, among others. Despite Kennedy’s focus on chronic diseases, CDC employees described broad cuts at the agency’s National Center for Chronic Disease and Health Promotion.\n\nI thought Mr. Secretary’s main target was chronic disease.\n\nThe offices at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health that handle Freedom of Information Act requests were also cut. The FDA lost many of its FOIA officers, but a few remained, including some who were working on litigation, according to a source familiar with the circumstances who spoke on the condition that they not be named for fear of reprisal.\n\nSeveral senior leaders at the CDC were reassigned to other roles, and some were told they would have to relocate. At NIH, Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was also offered reassignment to the Indian Health Service and would have to move to an area such as Alaska, New Mexico, or Minnesota.\n\nInternal exile. Who knew East Germany had so many lessons to teach us?\n\nOf course, as USA Today reports, the reservoir of sympathy from our national legislature remains fathomless.\n\nThe former Health and Human Services employee was among a small group of other fired federal workers protesting Tuesday, when he recorded an interaction with Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., telling him “Hi, I was a worker at HHS. I was fired illegally on February 14th. There are many people who are not getting social service programs, especially people with disabilities. Are you going to do anything to stop what’s happening?”\n\nBanks replied, “Uh, you probably deserved it.” Schroeder asked him why, and the lawmaker replied “Because you seem like a clown.”\n\nAfter the incident, Schroeder told USA TODAY that he found Banks’ comments shocking. “It felt very childish to hear someone in a leadership position whose constituents rely on these programs to say that,” Schroeder said. “I hope a lot of people in his state see the callousness that he demonstrated.”\n\nI just hope they don’t applaud.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "He means it. Make no mistake about that. Above all, don’t laugh it off. From NBC:\n\n“I’m not joking,” Trump said, when asked to clarify. “But I’m not—it is far too early to think about it.” When asked whether he has been presented with plans to allow him to seek a third term, Trump said, “There are methods which you could do it.” NBC News asked about a possible scenario in which Vice President JD Vance would run for office and then pass the role to Trump. Trump responded that “that’s one” method. “But there are others, too,” Trump added. Asked to share another method, Trump simply responded “no.”\n\nI felt all along that, if the Supreme Court had allowed Colorado and other states to boot him off the ballot in 2024 under the 14th Amendment’s anti-insurrection clause, as it should have, Trump would have run anyway. And if he’d not won the Republican nomination, he’d have shown sufficient strength to make that nomination worthless to Nikki Haley or whoever got it. He’d have puddle-jumped the country for his ego-feeding rallies and rendered the entire process a perilous farce. And, who knows, he might have done well enough to throw the whole thing into the House of Representatives and won anyway. Nobody in the Republican House majority was going to stop him. And the carefully manufactured conservative majority on the Supreme Court would have been completely up for grabs.\n\nFrankly, I don’t see why he wouldn’t try this in 2028. Even if the court grows a new and permanent backbone and rules that he is ineligible, there’s nothing to stop him from running on his own hook. There’s no Republican politician out there with the stones to take him on in as public a forum as a presidential campaign. The party structure has proven worse than useless against him. His base would love him even more because he once again was thumbing his nose at the Deep State—and a big chunk of it already doesn’t trust Chief Justice John Roberts and actively hates Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nHe still has his plane and enough people out there in the country willing to host his gatherings of the rubes. Plus, even with the court’s preposterous immunity ruling, he’s still in at least some danger of ending his life in jail. And that’s just for what he did in his first term. (If the House flips to the Democrats in 2026, the path would become a little more difficult. But remember: If a presidential election reaches the House, each state gets one vote and, obviously, Republicans can still lose their majority and still have majorities in a majority of the state delegations.)\n\nI have no doubt that some of Trump’s lawyers from the firm of Lickspittle and Doormat are scheming away already. There’s nobody around him these days with the patriotism God gave a goose—nobody to say no to his lunatic strategies. He’s not joking. He doesn’t have that kind of wit.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "This is how they do it—because they are heartless and gutless and they believe everyone in America is an idiot. From The Washington Post:\n\nThe Social Security Administration website crashed four times in 10 days this month, blocking millions of retirees and disabled Americans from logging in to their online accounts because the servers were overloaded. In the field, office managers have resorted to answering phones at the front desk as receptionists because so many employees have been pushed out. But the agency no longer has a system to monitor customers’ experience with these services, because that office was eliminated as part of the cost-cutting efforts led by Elon Musk.\n\nAnd the phones keep ringing. And ringing.\n\nThe federal agency that delivers $1.5 trillion a year in earned benefits to 73 million retired workers, their survivors and poor and disabled Americans is engulfed in crisis—further undermining its ability to provide reliable and quick service to vulnerable customers, according to internal documents and more than two dozen current and former agency employees and officials, customers and others who interact with Social Security.\n\nHeartless, because the Porcelain Man doesn’t care about any carbon-based life-form except himself, and he’s probably working on that, too. Gutless, because they wouldn’t dare come for Social Security in a frontal assault. (George W. Bush tried that, and his 2004 mandate vanished overnight.) So they weaken it from within, day after day, cut after cut, until they can claim that the system is broken and they can push it over so it shatters. The finest social-welfare program in the country’s history, as transformative a public-policy victory as any other, and it is being crippled unto death by a South African blow-in with enough money to buy the future so he can trash it.\n\nLeland Dudek—the accidental leader elevated to acting commissioner after he fed data to Musk’s team behind his bosses’ backs—has issued rapid-fire policy changes that have created chaos for front-line staff. Under pressure from the secretive Musk team, Dudek has pushed out dozens of officials with years of expertise in running Social Security’s complex benefit and information technology systems. Others have left in disgust.\n\nHe sounds like a swell fella. There is nobody in this administration worthy of the trust you’d give to a Gaboon viper. And that includes the guy at the top.\n\nAlarmed lawmakers are straining to answer questions from angry constituents in their districts. Calls have flooded into congressional offices. The AARP announced on Monday that more than 2,000 retirees per week have called the organization since early February—double the usual number—with concerns about whether benefits they paid for during their working careers will continue. Social Security is the primary source of income for about 40 percent of older Americans. Trump has said repeatedly that the administration “won’t touch” Social Security, a promise that aides say applies to benefit levels that can only be adjusted by Congress. But in just six weeks, the cuts to staffing and offices have already taken a toll on access to benefits, officials and advocates say.\n\n“Trump Has Said Repeatedly” may be the singularly worthless phrase in the English language.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "Senator John Fetterman, occasional Democrat of Pennsylvania, has been very big on the Dems in Disarray circuit, arguing that the president’s narrow victory in 2024 was really a landslide in disguise. From the Financial Times:\n\n“Some of the most extreme voices now are coming from the far-blue places that are removed from the real fight—and that’s down in the important states that decide who’s going to win the White House,” he said. Simply obstructing Republicans at every turn would be a “political loser” with average Americans, he added, impeding Democrats’ ability to defeat the Republicans in 2028. “The last time we were yelling and screaming and demanding new leadership, how did it work out?” he asked, referring to Biden’s removal. “Maybe we should just realize where we are and try to figure out a way forward—rather than just reacting.”\n\nTo be fair, Fetterman of late has been loud in his denunciations of Elon Musk and DOGE. Maybe he should get in touch with these constituents, too. From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:\n\nAgents from the Mount Pleasant office arrived at the scene shortly after the body of Joseph Guzzo Jr. had been pulled from under the massive chunk of earth that collapsed in the mine tunnel four years ago. Then, months after launching an investigation that found the operator failed to provide critical protections, it happened again. Another worker in a mine just an hour away suffered catastrophic injuries after a large rock broke from a wall and slammed him against a machine.\n\nAgents from the Mine Safety and Health Administration office carried out an inquiry once again and found the operator failed to detect the breakdowns in the wall that led to its collapse. Year after year, investigators from the Mount Pleasant office—the most active mine safety center in the nation—launched inquiries into deaths and devastating injuries in some of the largest underground mines in the country.\n\nGod’s work, if anything is. Of course, Musk’s Cargo Shorts Militia finds most of God’s work to be ... inefficient.\n\nIn an ongoing effort to slash spending, the Department of Government Efficiency has targeted the mining agency in a move that surprised local inspectors and raised questions about the future of federal regulation in one of the country’s most dangerous jobs. “Without the federal inspections, coal operations will just run rampant,” said Tony Oppegard, a former Kentucky mine safety prosecutor and MSHA legal adviser. “There won’t be any accountability.” It’s not clear if the inspectors at the local office and others will be transferred or lose their jobs, but the cancelling of the leases comes as the number of injured workers has been increasing in some of the most active mines in the U.S., the Post-Gazette has found.\n\nIt seems almost preposterous to have to argue that mine-safety regulations ought to be some of the most stringent—if not draconian—in all of federal law. Hell, this was an issue that prompted the largest armed labor hostilities in this country. That the DOGE and pony show is blindly rolling back the enforcement capacity in this area is making these people at risk for what is tantamount to negligent homicide.\n\nThe move by the new agency is the latest in a series of actions by federal officials that have raised alarms among safety advocates, who have long pushed for greater safeguards in mining. After years of medical experts warning about a new form of black lung disease caused by an insidious toxin—silica dust—federal regulators created a rule that would force coal operators to drastically reduce exposure levels underground. The protection, which cuts in half the amount of silica allowed in the air, is set to take effect next month, but is now under legal challenges by trade groups and allies in Congress who are threatening to roll it back under the new administration.\n\n“It’s a struggle,” said Jimmy Phillips, a retired West Virginia miner who was diagnosed with black lung a decade ago. “It feels like someone put an elephant on your chest after you go a little ways.” Year after year, he and others suffering from the disease travel to the Bluestone Health Association clinic in Princeton, W.Va.—some strapped to oxygen tanks or carrying inhalers. There, they get breathing treatments, medication and other care for an illness that has no cure. Though the clinic is funded partially through federal grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration, safety advocates say they’re concerned the money could be reduced or end under the new administration.\n\nThe lung disease caused by silica dust is even more crippling, and more lethal, than the more familiar “black lung” caused by inhaling coal dust.\n\nAnother visitor, Randall Dickerson, 49, is like so many others: The simple tasks of life are often insurmountable. “For me to walk 100 feet—it’s tough,” said the married father of three. “I wake up in the morning, I’m coughing my brains out. I have to use an inhaler and an oxygen machine, and I’m not even 50. That should never happen at my age.” When the illness is caused by silica—fine crystals that are more dangerous than coal dust—the chances of survival grow even more grim, experts say. “It’s like pieces of glass eating into your lungs,” said Amanda Lawson, a Bluestone benefits counselor who works with her mother, Ms. Johnson, at the center.\n\nGod’s work, all of them.",

    "content": "As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\n\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\n\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\n\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\n\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\n\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical?",

All weekend, the minions spread out over television, explaining the torpedo he's aimed at the world economy. Every one of these explanations expanded the exercise yard of bedlam.\n\nConvicted criminal and White House adviser Peter Navarro may have won the House Cup by citing a book written by an expert who didn't exist. (And, no, it wasn't noted econometrician Dr. Otto Yerass.) Kindly Doc Maddow busted him on TV last Friday.\n\nIn his books, Maddow continued, Navarro often cited the work of a so-called economics expert named Ron Vara. “V-A-R-A, Ron Vara,” Maddow said. “Vara” shared a memo in Washington D.C. circles after Trump won the presidency. “At one point, Ron Vara wrote in the memo that Trump could, quote, ‘Ride the tariffs to victory,'” Maddow said. The problem is, Ron Vara doesn’t exist. He never has. The economics expert that Peter Navarro has long cited to explain why he’s so gung-ho on tariffs, this person, Ron Vara, is a made-up person.”\n\n“He is a fictional person. Peter Navarro invented Ron Vara as his expert source, so he could quote this expert source over and over and over again in his crackpot books,” she continued. “Who is Ron Vara? Ron Vara is an anagram of Navarro, which is his last name...I mean, my name anagrams to Macho Wattler, but I don’t see myself trying to talk you into doing what Macho Wattler wants, right?” Maddow said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commerce Secretary spoke glowingly of a new golden age of manufacturing, with robots making iPhones in automated factories. Republican senators walked around, in the wonderful phrase Abraham Lincoln used to describe General Rosecrans after the defeat at Chickamauga, like ducks struck on the head, and hoping against hope that nobody notices that they could stop this festival of fruitcakes in a single afternoon. So Monday came and went, and nobody did anything, except the president, who threatened China with heavier tariffs if China continued to defend itself against the march of the New American Golden Age, and the stock market continued to sink into deep blue sea.\n\nTwenty-odd years ago, Jim Hightower, that great Texas hellraiser, proposed replacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average with what he called the \"Doug Jones Average.\" Hightower's notion was that the DJIA had only a tangential relevance to the true economic conditions afflicting Doug Jones, a hypothetical working man.\n\nThe media solemnly reports the Dow Jones Average every day. But I think it s time we heard the Doug Jones Average. Yeah, how's Doug doing? We need a real-life measure of How ya doin? for the 80 percent of Americans who don t own stocks and bonds, who re just trying to get their wages and monthly bills to shake hands and be friends again. Why not an economic report that goes something like this:\n\nThe Doug Jones Average took another tumble on this week s news that major industrials including Sears, Boeing and United Technologies were eliminating another 100,000 jobs. Turning now to the Doug's Lunch Bucket Index, the price of Spam was holding steady, citrus was down slightly due to seasonal fluctuations, but whole-wheat bread and packaged snacks jumped another five points each, signaling a poor performance this quarter for the Doug's family budget. Interest on bank deposits continued flat at under 3 percent, while credit-card interest rates held high at 18 to 24 percent, further pinching the Doug's bottom line.\n\nAs if responding to the Doug Jones Average, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared on Meet The Press and reassured a nervous nation not to be concerned about the fact that its 401(k)s were suddenly acting as though they were manufactured by Boeing. After all, Bessent said, most people don't check on their money anyway.\n\nI think that's a false narrative. Americans who want to retire right now, Americans who have put away for years in their savings accounts, I — I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what's happening.\n\nWell, we know Bessent doesn't care about the effect that those \"day-to-day fluctuations\" on all the Doug Joneses of the country. He just assumes they don't care. either. It's worked for these clowns so far.",

    "content": "The prosecution of El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago wrapped up in Manhattan, but not before things got lively again. The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\n\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\n\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom. Under the law, a representative for the media or even a member of the media is allowed to petition in open court for the opportunity to stay. Trump’s non-lawyer entourage was allowed to stay.\n\nMonday’s “non-lawyer entourage” included Bernie Kerik and Alan Dershowitz. I guess we’re down to the U-Team now.",

    "title": "Pete Hegseth Had a Really Bad Wednesday Thanks to SignalGate",
    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who swears that he’s been doing all this stuff sober, had a real bad Wednesday morning for himself. It followed a Tuesday Senate hearing in which the heads of the various intelligence branches tried to wriggle out from under the scandal regarding how the editor of The Atlantic was invited onto a chat concerning an imminent attack in Yemen. (Why are we killing people just to make the rubble bounce in Yemen? Good question.) His colleagues were quick to dive behind the excuse that no “war plans” were discussed on the chat, so what’s the big deal, dude? That alibi lasted less than a day. From the AP:\n\nIn the group chat, Hegseth posted multiple details about the impending strike, using military language and laying out when a “strike window” starts, where a “target terrorist” was located, the time elements around the attack and when various weapons and aircraft would be used in the strike. He mentioned that the U.S. was “currently clean” on operational security.\n\n“Godspeed to our Warriors,” he wrote.\n\n“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)” “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)” “1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)” “1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based’ targets)” “1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts – also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”“MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)”\n\nAnd now the punchline.\n\n“We are currently clean on OPSEC.”\n\nThe Aristocrats!\n\nShortly after The Atlantic published these receipts, the same vaudeville troupe from the intelligence community appeared before the House Intelligence Committee. Their act got roughly the same reception from the committee’s Democratic minority as it did from the Senate a day earlier. Except, of course, the latest revelations from The Atlantic necessitated some adjustments to their routine. Now, since “war plans” were indeed discussed on the chat, their primary excuse was that nothing that was discussed was classified. Rep. Joaquin Castro was unconvinced by this latest improv. First up for Castro was NSA director General Timothy Haugh:\n\nCastro: “If your organization, your agency, intercepted something like this from Russia or China or some other country, would you consider this classified information?”\n\nHaugh: “We would classify based off of our sources and methods. It would be classified based off of our collection. Based off of the protection of our own source and method, not necessarily based off the content, but how we collected that information.”\n\nCastro: “But, it would be classified? ... If you did your job and collected it from the Russian Foreign Ministry and the National Security Advisor and the Secretary of Defense and the President’s Chief Advisor—there is no way—no way, having sat on this committee for nine years, that somebody would come in with that information and give us something that says ‘unclassified—you can walk out of this room with this information and give it to whomever you want.’ ”\n\nAfter finishing with Haugh, Castro turned his attention to director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe, both of them former colleagues of his in the House.\n\nCastro: “You know, with all respect—you and I worked on the committee at the same time. Tulsi, you and I came in together. We’ve never had, I’ve never had an issue or beef with you. John, you and I are both from Texas—y’all know that’s a lie. It’s a lie to the country.”\n\nIt’s clear that events are starting to shuffle Hegseth toward the door. His fate now completely depends on his president’s stubborn refusal ever to admit to a mistake. The same can be said to be true of so much of the country, which is beginning to wish this vaudeville show had closed out of town.",

    "title": "Masked Agents Snatched a Tufts Grad Student off the Street Without Even a Hint of Due Process",
    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "As much as I abhor the cliché, the video really does look like something out of a movie—one of the Mission: Impossible sequels, maybe, or Taken 25. A young woman in a white coat is confronted on a sidewalk in Somerville, Massachusetts, right here in the U.S.A., by a group of masked individuals in dark clothing. The young woman does not put up a struggle as she is placed in restraints and shuffled off into a dark-colored SUV and gone. The whole thing takes two minutes and three seconds. A little slice of East Germany for you nostalgics out there.\n\nFrom The Boston Globe:\n\nPlainclothes officers handcuffed Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old Turkish national in the US on a student visa, and loaded her into an unmarked SUV with tinted windows as she pleaded for explanations, according to video of the arrest. She was transferred to Louisiana despite a federal judge ordering US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tuesday night not to remove Ozturk from Massachusetts without prior notice.\n\nThe precise timing of Ozturk’s transfer to Louisiana and the issuance of the judge’s order was unclear. It was also unclear why the government targeted Ozturk, who is doctoral candidate at Tufts department of child study and human development. She had voiced support for the pro-Palestinian movement at Tufts, but was not known as a prominent leader. Her lawyer said she is not aware of any charges against her. “I don’t understand why it took the government nearly 24 hours to let me know her whereabouts,” her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, said. “Why she was transferred to Louisiana despite the court’s order is beyond me. Rumeysa should immediately be brought back to Massachusetts, released, and allowed to return to complete her PhD program.”\n\nThis comes after border czar Tom Homan has made Boston a particular focus of his attention and admitted the other day that some of the 370 people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during a six-day operation were not criminals but “collaterals.”\n\nThe proximate cause of Ozturk’s being disappeared off a public street and off to Louisiana is that she took a side in a foreign conflict to which the United States isn’t even directly a party. Even if it were, of course, there would be no excuse for snatching people off the street and shipping them off to detention without even a wave at due process, in defiance of the constitutional guarantee of habeas corpus and contrary to an order from a federal court.\n\nYes, there are similar precedents in American history going all the way back to the passage of the Alien Enemies Act, the 18th-century law that so appeals to the president’s medieval lizard brain. And yes, more recently, there has been the long, slow slide toward authoritarianism, most notably during the Cointelpro days in the 1960s and, especially, in the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11, which saw wars of choice, a concentration camp in Cuba, extraordinary rendition, black sites all over the globe, and a torture regime that attempted to camouflage barbarism with euphemism. And even with a change of administrations, there were drone strikes until hell wouldn’t have them, rubble bouncing and gratuitous death. And, of course, back home, a bipartisan consensus against true accountability, exercised through direct stonewalling and, more delicately, through “looking forward, not back,” and the Constitution be damned.\n\nAll that being said, this video is different by an order of magnitude. This is an illegitimate act of political kidnapping, straight out of the Pinochet–Videla–Ríos Montt playbook. And it is no longer an isolated incident. ICE put the bag on another grad student, this one at the University of Alabama. From The Guardian:\n\nA spokesperson for the state’s flagship university said in a brief statement that a student was arrested “off campus” by federal immigration officials, but declined to comment further, citing privacy laws. The US government’s justification for detaining the student was not immediately clear, and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday. News of the arrest comes amid reports of the Trump administration increasingly targeting college students for arrest and deportation across the country, including people in the US on visas and permanent residents with green cards, raising alarms on campuses and in surrounding communities.\n\nThis is about rescinding valid immigration status for the purposes of being Bibi Netanyahu’s international goon squad, squashing dissent against his government by illegitimately using the power of our own. There was a time in my life that this would leave me in an ungovernable rage. Now I’m hardly surprised.",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "There are other courthouses in other places. They’re not in Washington. They’re the repair shops of the law. They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\n\n\n\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\n\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\n\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\n\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\n\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\n\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\n\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\n\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial",

    "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
    "content": "(Optional Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nYour cheesehead won’t get you into heaven anymore.\n\nFrom the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:\n\nCrawford, 60, had received 55% of the vote to conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel’s 45% with 82% of the vote in, according to unofficial results. Decision Desk HQ called the race less than an hour after polls closed at 8 p.m. At Crawford’s election night party in Madison, supporters cheered in response to calls that she had won the race early in the night. Groups in justice’s robes and cow-printed cowboy hats flooded the party to celebrate, while others dressed in America-themed outfits broke out in dance.\n\nSo Elon Musk flew to Green Bay, put on a silly hat, acted like a jackass on stage, handed out his golf-tournament checks, and his candidate went to bed before the Bucks game was over. That is a bit of old Wisconsin progressive ass-kicking right there—despite the fact that an elected judiciary is the second-worst idea in American politics.\n\n“As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin. And we won!” she said to cheers, referring to the $20 million-plus billionaire Elon Musk [spent] in an attempt to defeat her.\n\nChippewa Falls! Hometown of Annie Hall and, until this past January, alas, Leinenkugel’s lager beer! Helping face down a gazillionaire’s $20 million traveling plutocrat medicine show on behalf of one of its own.\n\nCrawford will replace outgoing liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, who did not run for re-election. She takes office Aug. 1. Her victory gives liberals control of the state’s high court for the next three years, when it is considering such issues as abortion, union rights and more. In rejecting Schimel, the state’s voters spurned Republican President Donald Trump, who endorsed him, and Musk in a race widely seen as a referendum on the president’s first two months in the White House.\n\nThat “more” includes ongoing disputes over Wisconsin’s electoral maps. From Bolts:\n\nCrawford winning a 10-year term means she’ll be on the court for the next round of redistricting, following the 2030 Census. District maps were hugely important in the state’s 2023 court election, and [Janet] Protasiewicz’s win paved the way for redrawn, fairer legislative maps that have reduced the GOP’s chokehold on state government. Wisconsin’s congressional map remains drawn to heavily, unfairly favor the GOP, as the state supreme court declined to hear a Democratic challenge two years ago. Several legal experts told Bolts they did not expect the court to revisit that decision in coming years, though national Democrats have expressed some hope they may soon get a more favorable ruling.\n\nNonetheless, this is another victory for Wisconsin Democratic leader Ben Wikler and his operation, even though a stringent voter-ID constitutional amendment passed on Tuesday night as well, and it calls for a cold Leinie’s raised in triumph. Sometimes Wisconsin remembers what it once was.\n\nRelated Story Trump’s Ivy League Shakedown Operation Is Now Targeting Harvard\n\n\n\n",

Eyebrows. [laughs]\n\nWhat a concept.\n\nThey've changed over the years.\n\nYes, I too over-plucked, because I was born in '85,\n\nand it's taken decades to grow them back.\n\nSo Anastasia was one of the first places I went in LA\n\nin my twenties and that's where I learned about eyebrows.\n\nRight now I'm like really loving this because it's easy.\n\nI can just use the wand and they paint\n\nthe lighter colored wands and make it all more uniform,\n\nand that's what I'm looking for.\n\nAnd I'm looking for thickness,\n\nbecause they are growing back,\n\nand they're growing back well, but there's some holes.\n\nYou're just painting them.\n\nWhen I was on As the World Turns, which is a soap opera,\n\nI remember feeling embarrassed to go to set\n\nbecause I felt like I just wasn't used\n\nto seeing my face covered in so much foundation and powder\n\nthat I almost like, my face would crack a little bit,\n\nand as a 15-year-old, that's scary,\n\nbut I look back and I'm like, that's TV makeup.\n\nAnd I looked really cute.\n\nLike, I didn't look ugly,\n\nI just felt ugly because I was a teenager,\n\nand that's just, that's what we do.\n\nSo now I'm gonna put the Anastasia gel on\n\nto hold it in place, 'cause I don't know about you,\n\nbut when I leave the house\n\nand I like put a sweater on or sweatshirt,\n\nI always put it over my face and it messes with my brows.\n\nI'll put a little bit more of this on.\n\nGoing from the soap operas that I had done\n\nto Mean Girls happened so randomly and so fast\n\nthat I was just going with the flow\n\nand I was just happy to be working.\n\nI knew how lucky I was,\n\nbut we didn't quite know how big that movie was gonna be.\n\nAlthough that sounds really sad,\n\nit kinda helped prepare me for the rejection\n\nthat every actor has.\n\nThe thing that I never understood was blush\n\nand it took me until my mid-thirties to discover the blush.\n\nIt's the secret weapon.\n\nIt's incredible!\n\nLike, I don't have rosy cheeks, unless I'm freezing.\n\nMonika Blunder is another beautiful makeup artist\n\nthat I've been working with since I was, since Mamma Mia!\n\nI'm obsessed with this Liquid Flush.\n\nIt looks like moisturizer,\n\nbut it's the most beautiful color.\n\nI put it on my hand.\n\nThis one is Salzburg, this one is my favorite.\n\nI just wrapped a movie in Budapest. It's a musical.\n\nI don't know how to describe the experience\n\nof shooting Ann Lee, the musical.\n\nIt is unlike anything else I've ever done,\n\nand it's unlike anything I think anyone's ever seen.\n\nI just wrapped Long Bright River,\n\nwhich is the show that's coming out on Peacock,\n\nand that was a lot,\n\nand I didn't have time to do my voice lessons,\n\nwhich I always do.\n\nWhen I was pregnant,\n\nI was doing them three times a week on Zoom,\n\nbut it was okay because the singing wasn't so technical.\n\nIt was more about using my, like, feeling the human.\n\nI'm singing through suffering, I'm singing through joy.\n\nI had to move my body in ways that I wouldn't normally\n\nwhen I'm recording a song, so, you'll see.\n\nThe most important thing since day one\n\nof learning how to do makeup is mascara for me,\n\nbecause I have blonde eyelashes,\n\nand so does my son, that poor boy,\n\nand when I was shooting Limited Too,\n\nI shot Limited Too with Leighton Meester, by the way.\n\nNot a lot of people know that.\n\nEverybody was so pretty and I was just so awkward,\n\nand I had braces at one point,\n\nand I remember going to the bathroom and putting mascara on,\n\nbecause no one was putting mascara on me 'cause I was a kid\n\nand I felt ugly.\n\nThat poor little girl,\n\n'cause I look back at these pictures, they're so beautiful.\n\nLike, we all looked so happy and youthful,\n\nand it goes to show like the pressure we put on ourselves\n\nat such a young age.\n\nAnd, God, my role as a mother is just like to pay attention\n\nto what my girl especially is going through,\n\nbecause she's older\n\nand I just wanna make sure she feels protected\n\nand she feels beautiful,\n\nand it doesn't have to do with the length\n\nor color of your eyelashes or eyebrows.\n\nIt's more about us and less about what the world is seeing.\n\nFlutter Extension Idole Mascara. It's new.\n\n[gentle music]\n\nThis is the matte lipstick, which I love,\n\nbecause I honestly, I don't put it all over my lips.\n\nI learned on a shoot once in London\n\nthat you can smudge the matte\n\nand it looks actually way cooler.\n\nSo I'm gonna do this a little bit, and go like this.\n\nI love a red lip at night.\n\nFor the daytime, I don't wanna scare people.\n\nSometimes when you rub your lips,\n\nthey look a little plump.\n\nDo I look like I'm going to the prom? No.\n\nBut I could totally go glam grocery shopping,\n\nand I can also just go out to lunch and I look clean.\n\nThe last thing I do,\n\nwhich is actually really fun because I am super translucent,\n\nis my friend Roxy, who I work with very often,\n\nshe made this Bronze Glow Mist.\n\nThis is just giving health.\n\n[can hisses]\n\nThat's it.\n\nIt's a color,\n\nand it looks like you've just been to the beach.\n\nMy hair was done, like, full disclosure,\n\nDJ Quintero did my hair yesterday.\n\nFruit press.\n\nIt's giving, she didn't just wake up,\n\nbut I swear to God, haven't brushed it.\n\nI have good hair, I'm gonna admit it,\n\nI know I have good hair,\n\nbut with good hair comes eczema, you know,\n\nit's gotta balance out the scales.\n\nThank you.",

    "content": "Transcript\n\nHey Vogue, I'm Meghann Fahy,\n\nand I am going to walk you through\n\nmy sort of dry skin sometimes, adult acne,\n\nmorning skincare routine.\n\nAnd then I'm gonna show you my everyday makeup routine.\n\nFirst step is my cleanser.\n\nIt's really gentle and super non-drying.\n\nHonestly, the last couple years,\n\nI started getting regular facials\n\nand kind of investing in what was I actually putting\n\non my skin.\n\nAnd I'm here to tell you\n\nit really made a difference.\n\nAt nighttime, this is usually when I see\n\nhow much makeup I still have on my face,\n\nbut today it's clean.\n\nThis serum, which is especially hydrating,\n\nand I do think you're supposed to put it in your palm\n\nand then put it on your face.\n\nBut I like to go straight in for the real thing\n\nand just put it right directly on my face.\n\nI put it on my neck too\n\nbecause one of the Real Housewives said once,\n\nDo not neglect the neck.\n\nAnd I can't stop thinking about that.\n\nMy Pro-Heal Serum, it's vitamin C.\n\nAnd again, straight on the face with it.\n\nI watched Julianne Moore do this\n\nand she just seemed so cool.\n\nI mean she's so cool.\n\nBut she like put a couple drops in her hand\n\nand like pressed it into her skin,\n\nwhich I do think is the correct way to do this.\n\nBut you know what? It's your skincare routine. You do you.\n\nOkay, eye cream. This stuff.\n\nI was overusing this,\n\nand what was happening was I was putting it on\n\nand then I was putting my concealer on\n\nand it was doing that thing\n\nwhere it like gets all gross on your face\n\nand I was having to wipe it off\n\nand then I realized that I was just using too much of it so.\n\nAnd then last step is my moisturizer,\n\nwith SPF 30 in it, Paula's Choice.\n\nJennifer Coolidge told me\n\nwhen we were shooting White Lotus\n\nthat it sounded like a pregnancy foam, Paula's Choice.\n\nAnd I think about that when I put it on.\n\nBut what I love about it is A, it has sunscreen in it,\n\nand B, once it's rubbed in\n\nand it doesn't look like I have zinc all over me,\n\nit really gives the skin a nice glow.\n\nI think when I was younger I never wanted\n\nto wear sunscreen 'cause I wanted to be tan.\n\nBut then I learned that I can't tan,\n\nI just get freckles and sunburns.\n\nSo now I've really embraced the SPF.\n\nIt feels like everybody knows now\n\nthat that's sort of the number one anti-aging thing\n\nthat we can all do.\n\nAnd because this like makes my skin kind of like glowy,\n\nif I'm not wearing makeup or something\n\nand I put this on,\n\nI still kind of feel like I've done something.\n\nLast step in my skincare\n\nis just I put a little bit of this on.\n\nI know it says sleeping mask,\n\nbut I wear it a lot when I'm awake.\n\nFoundation. I like to shake it a little.\n\nI like to just put it right, right on my face.\n\nDirect contact.\n\nI probably should use one of those cool girl sponges,\n\nbut I, I don't.\n\nAnd this is Vogue and I have to tell the truth to Vogue.\n\nI do have a cool girl sponge.\n\nI just only use it for concealer for some reason.\n\nAnd this one comes in this little egg,\n\nwhich is cute 'cause I feel like it keeps the sponge clean.\n\nThis is my concealer.\n\nLittle bags and then I do like,\n\nI have a little something there\n\nso I just kind of hit it like that.\n\nA little something there.\n\nI love trying new stuff.\n\nI think I love it a little too much.\n\nI will walk into a Sephora to buy one thing\n\nand I'll come out with like two bags full of stuff.\n\nI also kind of just drag this across my eyelid a little bit\n\n'cause I'm so fair skinned\n\nthat sometimes my eyes look really red on my eyelids.\n\nWhen I was little, another thing that I didn't like,\n\napart from sunscreen, was having freckles at all.\n\nAnd now I've sort of embraced them.\n\nSo I try to pick makeup\n\nthat doesn't make them feel like\n\nthey've been erased in any way.\n\nLittle bronzer moment.\n\nI just kind of like swish it\n\nand then I do that on the mirror.\n\nI don't know why.\n\nI do try to pick up certain things\n\nwhen I'm, you know, on set.\n\nI, obviously, get my makeup done so often.\n\nAnd one thing that I still have not been able\n\nto do is my eye makeup.\n\nI have no less than 75 eyeshadow palettes\n\nand all of them remain unused, which is really sad.\n\nFirst, we're gonna do blush.\n\nso I kind of like swipe it with this.\n\nIt's giving clown cheek,\n\nwhich this might be leaning towards a little bit.\n\nTake this bad boy back out of his little egg house.\n\nI'm a huge lash person.\n\nI feel like I don't look like I have any\n\nuntil I'm wearing mascara.\n\nAnd I love this one, this Victoria Beckham one,\n\nbecause it kind of, like at night when you wash it off,\n\nit doesn't get all of your face.\n\nIt just sort of comes off.\n\nOkay, this is the part where I try to do this\n\nand keep my mouth closed\n\nbecause the reality of the situation is that,\n\nwhen I'm at home and I'm doing this,\n\nI look a lot like this.\n\nBut again, it's Vogue so I'm gonna try to keep my mouth.\n\nIt's a lot harder for me than it looks like,\n\nespecially the bottom lashes.\n\nIt has to be this.\n\nSo this is my eyebrow pencil.\n\nI've been super duper blonde.\n\nI've been like hybrid, which is kind of what I am right now.\n\nAnd it's hard to find a shade that isn't too dark for me\n\nor too light 'cause I don't really have blonde eyelashes,\n\nbut I just have very light brown one.\n\nFor Drop,\n\nI was in a really cool hair and makeup look\n\nbecause the whole thing takes place on a date.\n\nSo she's sort of a little bit extra glammed.\n\nI kind of had like a red lip going,\n\nwhich isn't something I normally do in my actual life\n\nbecause I don't have the patience to maintain a lipstick.\n\nBut when someone else is doing it for you,\n\nit's way more fun.\n\nSo that was really awesome.\n\nOkay, brow gel. Here we go.\n\nI'm a huge Q-tip fan. I always travel with them.\n\nI always have them in my purse.\n\nI always have them in my makeup bag.\n\nBecause I just feel like they're like, what can't they do?\n\nDo one of these little guys.\n\nAnd if I have some mascara on the top of my lid,\n\nwhich I usually make enough of a mess to do.\n\nHighlighter. I'm kind of obsessed with this.\n\nI will put this on sometimes even if I don't have makeup on.\n\nAnd I just do this, make kind of like an L-shape almost.\n\nAnother thing I haven't really figured out how to do\n\nis like the little nose thing.\n\nLike when you put it here.\n\nSee that looks crazy when I do it,\n\nbut I love it when other people do it.\n\nI honestly think the trend I wish I could do\n\nis like the nose shading\n\nwith the sort of like cutie little like frosted nose.\n\nI was really into Avril Lavigne when I was a kid\n\nand she didn't have freckles.\n\nSo I thought one day if I put enough foundation on,\n\nmy mom's foundation, that it would cover up the freckles.\n\nAnd I've put like four or five layers on\n\nand then my face was just like the color of those flowers\n\nand I was devastated to learn\n\nthat that's not what foundation really does.\n\nThis Armani Beauty sort of like lipstick-lip gloss hybrid.\n\nI've had this for years. They don't make it anymore.\n\nAnd so I rarely use it because I love it so much.\n\nI like the way it smells.\n\nI've used this on The Bold Type all the time.\n\nI think I actually just took it home when we wrapped.\n\nIf I smell it, still kind of reminds me\n\nof that time in my life, which was a very good one.\n\nSo it's just my sentimental little lipstick.\n\nBut because I saved that one,\n\nI use this one, which they do make.\n\nI like that it feels like lipstick,\n\nbut it kind of goes on like gloss.\n\nIt's one of these little smudge moments.\n\nNormally my hair is like up on top of my head,\n\nbut I do have a blowout today,\n\nso I wanted to protect her and I will take out these clips.\n\nWow, I didn't do this to my own hair,\n\nbut I'm going somewhere this weekend.\n\nSo I just felt like, you know what?\n\nGetting a blowout on a Friday\n\nand having hair for the whole weekend, what a luxury.\n\nThat's the end of me\n\nand we'll see how long my lipstick lasts.\n\nI had a blast. Thanks Vogue.",

    "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
    "content": "When guests arrive at the 2025 Met Gala for “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style”—the spring 2025 exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute—they’ll do so having considered the dress code, announced today as Tailored for You. Per The Met, the dress code is a nod to the exhibition’s focus on menswear and is “purposefully designed to provide guidance and invite creative interpretation.”\n\n“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” will explore the role of sartorial style in forming Black identities, focusing on the emergence, significance, and proliferation of the Black dandy. Composed of clothing, photographs, fine art, historical texts, and artifacts, it’s the first Costume Institute exhibition to focus on menswear since 2003’s “Men in Skirts” and was inspired by guest curator Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book, Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.\n\n“Dandyism can seem frivolous, but it often poses a challenge to or a transcendence of social and cultural hierarchies,” Miller said in today’s statement. “It asks questions about identity, representation, and mobility in relation to race, class, gender, sexuality, and power. This exhibition explores dandyism as both a pronouncement and a provocation.”\n\nThe show also reflects The Met’s ongoing commitment to authentically diversifying its exhibitions. “What makes it possible to translate Monica’s book Slaves to Fashion into an exhibition,” said Costume Institute curator in charge Andrew Bolton, “is our collection of high-style menswear, which serves as a foundation for imagining and realizing a sartorial history of Black dandyism.”\n\nAndré Leon Talley 5th Avenue, Arthur Elgort (American, born 1940), 1986; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, The Irene Lewisohn Costume Reference Library Suit, Morty Sills (American, active mid-to-late 19th century), 1986; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Alfred Z. Solomon-Janet A. Sloane Endowment Fund, 2023 (2023.784a–c). Photo © Tyler Mitchell 2025\n\nNow, about the dress code: Tailored for You can be interpreted in a myriad of ways, but it mostly means embracing looks reflective of one’s personal style. We can surely expect inspired takes on suiting—from versions of the zoot silhouette popularized by jazz musicians in the 1940s to the bold, colorful styles worn by Congolese sapeurs—though other menswear staples, such as hats, ties, canes, brooches, and pocket squares, are likely to have a strong showing too.\n\nIndeed, attendees might look to Met Gala co-chairs Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, and Pharrell Williams—along with honorary chair LeBron James—for inspiration. Think Domingo arriving at the 2024 Critics Choice Awards in a mustard yellow Valentino suit and textured gold coat or Hamilton en route to the Miami Grand Prix paddock in a diamanté tank top and sleek black shades. We’ve also seen Rocky adorn his braided hair with silk scarves and beaded clips; Williams don Billionaire Boys Club graphic tees and Louis Vuitton leather flares of his own design; and James wear custom Thom Browne during the 2018 NBA Finals.",

    "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
    "content": "This month, Margot Robbie has been on-location in the U.K. filming Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of Wuthering Heights. (I mean, did you not see those epic wedding dress photos?). But yesterday in London, the actor enjoyed a rare day off by grabbing lunch with her husband, Tom Ackerley. Naturally, Robbie had a cool, casual off-duty look for the outing. After all, the star is never without a fashion-forward outfit, even if she is merely stepping out for coffee. (See: her maternity wardrobe last year.)\n\nRobbie’s version of a day-off uniform? It was a fresh take on double denim, otherwise known as the Canadian tuxedo. The star chose a matching light-wash set, consisting of an oversized button-up shirt paired with baggy jeans. While she could have easily drowned in the look’s sea of denim fabric, her sharper accessories—like black pointed heels, and a sleek leather shoulder bag—gave the pieces a more polished finish.\n\nRobbie isn’t the first star to embrace the classic appeal of a Canadian tuxedo, either. Many Hollywood trendsetters have doubled up on denim, from Rihanna to Bella Hadid, proving that it’s a timeless combo that will always make a statement. Robbie’s new approach—by going oversized, and adding structured accessories—is the styling move to replicate for spring.",

    "content": "Transcript\n\nHello, Vogue.\n\nI'm Cate Blanchett, and this is My Life in Looks.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music]\n\nI'm a little nervous, but je ne regrette rien, right?\n\nOh, my giddy aunt.\n\nI think I'm wearing my mother's sweater,\n\nand it looks like my school shirt.\n\nI'm probably also wearing the underpants\n\nthat my mother made me.\n\nUntil about 10 years ago,\n\nI still had the underpants that my mother sewed.\n\nClearly not wearing any makeup.\n\nGod bless me, I look like I'm 12,\n\nbut this was at the Sydney Theater Critics Awards,\n\nand I won Best Newcomer.\n\nI was in a production of Oleanna,\n\nand then I loved it so much, I ran the company.\n\nI think I might've come straight from rehearsals.\n\nClearly, I didn't realize\n\nI was gonna be photographed or win.\n\nNext.\n\nOh, look, this is the very first time I went\n\nto the Academy Awards.\n\nI had done a shoot in Australia,\n\nand I'd fallen in love with this dress\n\nthat John Galliano had designed that was knitted,\n\nwhite knitted, and was embellished\n\nwith all of this amazing embroidery,\n\nand I met him in London\n\nand he said that he would design something for me,\n\nand he said, Let's change the color.\n\nAnd he sat down, it was like being on the couch,\n\nand he asked about my family and my marriage,\n\nand then he embellished, I think you can just see it\n\nat the bottom there, there's a little hummingbird,\n\nand there's two hummingbirds on the dress,\n\nand one was me, and one was my husband Andrew.\n\nso there's kind of a real beautiful story.\n\nI gave it to amfAR,\n\nso now someone else is wearing it, sadly. [laughs]\n\nBut anyway, I love that dress so much.\n\nOh, an A for effort.\n\nThis is me at the BAFTAs. I played Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nWhen we made the film, we actually thought,\n\nwe'll have to take the first off there,\n\nbecause maybe an audience would think\n\nthere was a sequel coming, that it was Elizabeth Part One,\n\nbut it was Elizabeth I, and I'm glad I'm wearing a slip.\n\nI mean, you just take the slip off,\n\nI guess you could wear that today.\n\nAm I an early adopter of that?\n\nNo, or am I holding something? I have got my glasses on.\n\nOh, this was a dress that Jean Paul Gaultier designed.\n\nMy father-in-law, who's no longer with us,\n\ncalled it an exit dress.\n\nHe said people don't think much when you come into the room,\n\nbut when you leave, they go, wow.\n\nThere was obviously a lot of jewelry Jean Paul Guttier\n\nhad put on the dress, but Cynthia Bach then provided\n\nall of the amazing pieces.\n\nI was playing a psychic in Savannah\n\nin a small film called The Gift with Sam Raimi,\n\nand I had never been to a psychic,\n\nand I got her to do a reading for me,\n\nand she made some predictions, wild predictions.\n\nI'd play a writer who had short hair\n\nwho died for what she believed in, Guavin Guevin.\n\nI played Veronica Guerin,\n\nand she said that I would wear a dress\n\nthat was gonna change my career, and then I wore that.\n\nI don't know if it's changed my career,\n\nbut I'm very pleased I wore it.\n\nOh, bless.\n\nNow, that is my own hair,\n\nand that's just me on a Sunday morning in the pond.\n\nNext, in a little-known film called Lord of the Rings,\n\nplaying Galadriel.\n\nI did have someone I deeply respect say to me,\n\nLook, they're making this weird film in New Zealand,\n\nand they want you to play an elf for three weeks.\n\nYou don't wanna do that, do you?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nAfter the film was over, my husband,\n\nhe's fallen out of the habit,\n\nhe sort of does it to the children now,\n\nbut he used to drag me around by my ears.\n\nIt was playful, and so I told the guys at Weta\n\nwho did all of the prosthetics this,\n\nand they gave me, it was kind of creepy,\n\na chocolate box full of ear tips\n\nthat they'd made to look like chocolates,\n\nand then they bronzed my ears\n\nso I could give 'em to my husband.\n\nThat is me on the set of The Aviator,\n\nwhich Martin Scorsese directed.\n\nI think it's between takes.\n\nI was playing Catherine Hepburn.\n\nOne of the more daunting things I've ever done,\n\nbut when Scorsese asks you to do anything,\n\nI'd be a tree for him.\n\nThat was the first time I worked with the great Sandy Powell\n\non the costumes, and my relationship with costume designers,\n\nI've realized over time,\n\nis really pivotal to creating a character,\n\nand obviously, even before you utter a word,\n\nan audience is gonna start reading your character\n\nby what they wear and how they wear it,\n\nand something that Marty did,\n\nhe liberated me from having to do any imitation of Hepburn.\n\nHe played a lot of those early screwball comedies she did,\n\nand Bringing Up Baby was one of them, so I watched that.\n\nCatherine Hepburn is so raked thin,\n\nand then you don't plan for these things,\n\nand then the film got nominated, and I did,\n\nand so I had to do a lot of red carpets pregnant,\n\nand Donna Karan made me this amazing stretchy dress\n\nthat really celebrated the fact I was pregnant.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is back in 2006 for Vogue.\n\nIt's a very memorable shoot.\n\nTonne Goodman styled it, and Steven Klein shot it.\n\nThe clothes were insane.\n\nI mean, this one was another Galliano.\n\nThe pose was really difficult to hold,\n\nand I learned so much about making a picture working\n\nwith Steven Klein and Tonne on this shoot.\n\nNext.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this was the first time I went to the Met Ball,\n\nand I went with Nicolas Ghesquiere\n\nwhen he was at Balenciaga.\n\nSo we just shot with Irving Penn that day,\n\nand Nicolas had done his take on an Elizabethian garment,\n\nand then we went straight from there,\n\nwe had to do a quick 360 and then show up to the Met Ball.\n\nThe theme was Poiret: King of Fashion.\n\nI mean, I just went to the exhibition\n\nand could have stayed there.\n\nIt's always so great.\n\nI mean, the room is really vibrant, of course,\n\nbut it's always important to remember the exhibition\n\nand the reason why you're there.\n\nOkay, next one. [gasps] There we go.\n\nHere is the photograph that Irving Penn took,\n\nand this was in Penn's studio.\n\nThe taking of the picture was incredibly quick,\n\nbut the sitting and preparing,\n\nit's like I've had the great fortune\n\nof being photographed by Penn and by Avedon.\n\nIt's all about their regard\n\nand knowing when to press the shadow,\n\nand so to be beheld by him was just unforgettable.\n\nThis was the second time I played Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Elizabeth: Golden Age.'\n\nThe costumes were designed by Alexandra Byrne.\n\nI mean, she referenced a lot of haute couture,\n\nand there were a lot of Balenciaga references,\n\nand she made one dress that was so enormous,\n\nI couldn't fit through the doorway of the cathedral\n\nthat we were shooting in. [laughs]\n\nHello, Bob.\n\nI've worked with the great Todd Haynes a couple of times,\n\nand I hope I get to do it a couple of times more.\n\nHe's so fantastic to work with.\n\nI had literally walked off the set\n\nof playing Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Queen Elizabeth: The Golden Age on a Friday, wrapped,\n\nand then had to be on set playing Bob Dylan\n\nin Montreal on Monday.\n\nTodd had divided Bob's persona, Bob, like I know him,\n\nDylan's persona into many different characters,\n\nand the late, great Heath Ledger was one of them,\n\nand Christian Bale. and I played this electric silhouette.\n\nI think he wanted a woman inside this period\n\nof Dylan's musical career.\n\nIt meant that there was a separation between\n\nhow iconic this period and this look of Dylan's was\n\nand the character playing,\n\n'cause you know there's a woman inside that,\n\nbut it was so liberating.\n\nI had fantastic eyebrows and sideburns.\n\nWas that the only time my husband hasn't wanted to kiss me?\n\nOh, this is from Carol, a Todd Haynes film.\n\nI played alongside the wonderful Rooney Mara,\n\nand that coat was a nightmare.\n\nSandy Powell did the costumes again, and once again,\n\nI mean, she can do an enormous,\n\nwe worked together on Cinderella with unbelievable costumes\n\nwith a much bigger budget,\n\nand then we had $2.50 to pull this one together,\n\nand she had two coats, and one was great and stable,\n\nand this one was like a little fragile creature\n\nthat kept falling apart, and I said,\n\nI'm really sorry, Sandy. I think it's that one.\n\nAnd she goes, I know, I knew you were gonna say that.\n\nSo Sandy, the great Sandy Powell,\n\nwas literally behind the car in between every take,\n\n'cause we had to get out, and it was really windy,\n\nand the coat would come apart,\n\nand so she was there in between takes sewing it up.\n\nI felt a responsibility for this for sure,\n\nbecause films like this, up to this point,\n\nweren't really made and certainly not made\n\nin the mainstream, and really,\n\nif anyone comes up to me in the supermarket,\n\nthis is the film that they talk about,\n\nand so it was really, really important to a lot of people.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is Sarah Burton when she was at McQueen,\n\nand it was the most exquisite piece of embroidery.\n\nThe bottom, you can't really see there,\n\nbut it was all feathers.\n\nso I love that dress so much that then, during COVID,\n\nI presided over the jury in Venice, and there was no time.\n\nAll the ateliers were closed, so I said,\n\nCould I borrow that piece of embroidery again?\n\nAnd then I had a pair of pants and wore it,\n\nbecause I thought, when you have something\n\nso beautiful like that, it's a crime to wear it once.\n\nIt's even more beautiful in person.\n\nThe year I was nominated for Blue Jasmine\n\nat the Golden Globes,\n\nMr. Armani had designed this beautiful preve dress.\n\nIt was an impossible gown,\n\nand you didn't really see the back,\n\nbecause it goes right down to this plunging base.\n\nThe back is bare, and this beautiful lace,\n\nwhich has become quite signature,\n\nI was at on the jury in Cannes,\n\nand I wore it to the opening night,\n\nand I remember people saying to my publicist, [laughs]\n\nOkay, Kate's wearing the-\n\nShe's worn that dress before, as if I didn't know.\n\nOh, really?\n\nAnd I was so pleased to wear it again\n\nbecause I'd loved it so much.\n\n[gasps] Sarah Burton, there she is in Cannes.\n\nSarah made this beautiful, it was like a tuxedo,\n\nbut it was a dress, and had this massive bow on the back,\n\nand it was actually shown on the runway as a jacket,\n\nand she said, why don't I try and turn it into a dress?\n\nAnd so I love that, and I wore that again\n\nto Sarah's final show for McQueen.\n\nHere we are back at the Venice Film Festival,\n\nand this is a Schiaparelli flummery\n\nwhich I'd seen on the runway and absolutely loved\n\nand managed not to poke myself in the eye with it.\n\nThis was an example on Tar\n\nof the character coming to life, really.\n\nThe script by Todd Field was just,\n\nhe didn't change a syllable,\n\nit was so exquisitely wrought and written.\n\nIt was like, how do you make a female conductor look,\n\nsomeone who was in incredibly powerful\n\nand very, very aware of her presence?\n\nAnd so we went for this,\n\nI guess what has been termed quiet luxury look,\n\nreally great tailoring.\n\nI've had a couple of experiences in my life\n\nwhere I've just been so in sync with a director\n\nand a script, and you're lucky if you have one\n\nof those experiences in your life,\n\nbut I've had a handful of them, and I'm so grateful,\n\nand Tar was definitely one of them.\n\nMusic has come back into my life in a really major way,\n\nand that's because of this experience.\n\nHere we are. This is Armani Prive.\n\nThis is the dress that just keeps on giving,\n\nThat was from the current Prive collection, and I said,\n\nLook, I know there's this leftover lace from the dress\n\nthat I'd worn to the Globes all those years before,\n\nand they found an offcut,\n\nand so they made the internal corset out of that offcut.\n\nIt's felt great, and I've since worn it again\n\nwith the actual piece that goes underneath it,\n\nand I wanted to wear it with a T-shirt,\n\nbut Mr. Armani wouldn't let me.\n\nYou gotta respect the maestro, right?\n\n[gasps] Oh, hey. Well this is an oldie but a goodie.\n\nWith my first paycheck as an actor,\n\nI bought an Armani suit, and this is it,\n\nand I wear it wherever I can,\n\nand I think we were there in Milan for a Prive show.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, well, this is at Cannes,\n\nand this is the incomparable Nicolas Ghesquiere.\n\nIt's a particular type of beading,\n\nso the dress is incredibly heavy,\n\nbut such is his mastery that he makes it look so light,\n\nand the shoulders are really big.\n\nIn the hands of someone else, could look really solid,\n\nbut then he's got that beautiful drape,\n\nbut yeah, I can't wait to wear this one again.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThis is Brandon Maxwell.\n\nI'm going to Good Morning America.\n\nLooking so good. Did my own hair and makeup, right?\n\nHave that time in the morning.\n\nI love a Canadian tuxedo, double denim, triple denim,\n\nand this wasn't actually denim, it was more like a velvet,\n\nso it was really comfy and cozy.\n\nOh, once again, this is also for Borderlands,\n\nand I'm obsessed with this Swedish designer.\n\nShe's taken sustainable dressing to a whole new level\n\nand seamed this piece that was a dress all done in spoons.\n\nUnderneath this is kind of a cotton netting\n\ninto which she put the spoons on when you get dressed\n\nand it's backless, and then she put some spoons\n\nonto sort of a suit that I wore\n\nfor the Disclaimer premiere in Toronto for the festival.\n\nI mean, it was a crazy bonkers COVID film that I made.\n\nI really love the films of Jodorowsky,\n\nand there was one film of his\n\nwhere they were all in the desert,\n\nand the character has these incredible fingerless gloves.\n\nI thought it'd be good to have something on your hand\n\nin a close-up.\n\n[gasp] Oh, this is the 2024 Rumours premiere\n\nat the New York Film Festival,\n\nand I'd seen this, and I just thought it was hilarious.\n\nIt's Fiorucci, I think.\n\nI wear those leather pants every Wednesday.\n\nMy favorite pair of leather pants.\n\nYeah, it's a bit my Cousin Itt look.\n\nNot breathable, and don't go near me with a naked flame.\n\nThis is the thing,\n\nwhen you think about re-wearing something, you think,\n\nhow could I wear it?\n\nIt would kind of be cool as a skirt.\n\nBlack Bag.\n\nWorking again with Steven Soderbergh,\n\none of the most stylish filmmakers around,\n\nand Alan Mirojnick, who is one\n\nof the greatest costume designers, and I play a spy,\n\nand the only thing Steven said to me is, I want big hair.\n\nIt's a great film, and really fantastic cast.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music] [pen scratching]\n\nThanks, Vogue. That wasn't so painful after all.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music continues]",

    "content": "The 2025 Met Gala is officially only a few months away! Read on for everything you need to know about fashon’s biggest night—from the date to the theme, co-hosts, and this year’s dress code.\n\nThe Met Gala is a charity event and fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. It has traditionally been timed to mark the opening of the department’s annual fashion exhibition. Year after year, the event raises eight-figure sums.\n\nWhen will the Met Gala 2025 take place?\n\nThe 2025 Met Gala will take place on Monday, May 5.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala 2025 theme?\n\nOn Wednesday, October 9, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced the Costume Institute’s spring 2025 exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Drawing inspiration from Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, the exhibition is organized into 12 sections, each representing a characteristic that defines dandy style: Ownership, Presence, Distinction, Disguise, Freedom, Champion, Respectability, Jook (defined in Zora Neale Hurston’s “Characteristics of Negro Expression”—an important reference for the exhibiton—as a space for dancing, drinking, and other leisure activities), Heritage, Beauty, Cool, and Cosmopolitanism.\n\n“Superfine” will feature garments, paintings, photographs, and more from artists including Torkwase Dyson, Tanda Francis, André Grenard Matswa, and Tyler Mitchell—all exploring the indelible style of Black dandies, from the 18th century through to the present day. (Miller will also serve as a guest curator for the show, working alongside Costume Institute Curator in Charge Andrew Bolton.)\n\nWho is hosting the Met Gala 2025?\n\nColman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour will co-chair the 2025 Met Gala, with LeBron James serving as an honorary chair.\n\nReviving a tradition from years past, the 2025 Met Gala will also have a host committee, made up of André 3000, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Jordan Casteel, Dapper Dan, Doechii, Ayo Edebiri, Edward Enninful, Jeremy O. Harris, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Rashid Johnson, Spike Lee and Tonya Lewis Lee, Audra McDonald, Janelle Monáe, Jeremy Pope, Angel Reese, Sha'Carri Richardson, Tyla, Usher, and Kara Walker.\n\nWhat is the dress code?\n\nThis just in: the Met Gala 2025 dress code is “Tailored for You,” a nod to the exhibition’s focus on menswear and suiting that’s sure to bring out the sartorial creativity of this year’s attendees.\n\nWhat happens at the Met Gala?\n\nThat’s kept largely under wraps; guests must abide by a no-phone (and, therefore, no social media) policy once they’ve entered the museum. But the run-of-show involves dinner—overseen this year by chef Kwame Onwuachi, of the restaurants Tatiana in Lincoln Center and Dōgon in Washington, DC—and a high-profile performer (or two). Attendees also always have a moment to explore the exhibition.",

They can also expect newer art nouveau-inspired embroideries, bringing a fresh dimension to our signature aesthetic, alongside some of our bestselling concept saris and gowns,” says Gupta.\n\nAbu Jani Sandeep Khosla, the beloved designer duo synonymous with reviving and contemporizing embroidery techniques, will also mark their presence at the Vogue Wedding Atelier. Invitees can expect one-of-a-kind couture experiments that dig deep into India's textile heritage, but find new expressions for the modern bride.\n\nFollowing up his epic 25th anniversary show in Mumbai, which had Christy Turlington make her Indian runway debut, Sabyasachi Mukherjee will be joining the festivities. He will be presenting a special edit of high jewelry, a creative venture that the cerebral couturier is particularly passionate about.\n\nA historic milestone that marks this landmark showcase is the debut of Elie Saab’s ready-to-wear bridal collection in India. The Lebanese haute couture maison, now in its 46th year, is a bridal and celebrity favorite, its signature ballgowns and floral appliqué capes finding favor with red carpet regulars from Jennifer Lopez and Beyonce to Alia Bhatt and Sonam Kapoor. At the Vogue Wedding Atelier, the maison will present an India-inspired edit, with a never-before-seen rani-pink gown and veil that draws from the country’s iconic contributions to the world of color.\n\nSunita Shekhawat, the meenakari maestro of India, will be showcasing her timeless masterpieces. As Shekhawat herself says, “As much as I enjoy crafting jewelry, it’s a joy to meet people who understand luxury craftsmanship and Indian aesthetics. This year is special, as we are marking a calendar year with our museum.” Joining her on the slate is Ahmedabad-based couture label, Shyamal & Bhumika. “We are very excited to be a part of the Vogue Wedding Atelier this year, this platform beautifully brings together the finest in wedding design and style, and we’re thrilled to engage with brides and grooms who appreciate timeless craftsmanship, opulence and bespoke artistry.”\n\nFor the discerning bride, the Vogue Wedding Atelier presented by HSBC will also showcase special collections from designers like Ritika Mirchandani, Aisha Rao and more, along with the best in high jewelry from legacy brands like Khanna Jewellers, Rare Heritage, Mehta & Sons X Anjali Bhimrajka Fine Jewels to name a few.

If anyone died? Though, if no one died, what were those gunshots from the first episode? Did a monkey get hold of a gun? If a monkey got hold of a gun, I want credit for predicting it!).

    "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
    "content": "It’s a liminal season for all, but especially for Jennifer Lawrence. Not only is the actor experiencing New York’s utterly graceless winter-to-spring transition—and all of the rain, wind, and random heatwaves that come with it—but she is also readjusting her wardrobe after giving birth to her second child.\n\nSo far, the actor has managed both sets of changes with aplomb. Lawrence proved that her maternity staples (like her beloved cobalt blue sweater) are just as welcome in her postpartum wardrobe; She’s also remained something of a sneaker savant, practically daring us to buy a pair of Adidas Tokyos.\n\nBut one area where Lawrence has truly excelled lately is with her statement bag repertoire. She’s been especially keen on animal print, from her leopard tote bag to her zebra Fendi backpack. She kept her hot streak going for dinner with husband Cooke Maroney last night, carrying a burgundy alligator Hermès Bolide bag: a ladylike top-handle purse first introduced by the house in 1923, and a far cry from the boxier Birkins and Kellys that rule the It-Bag roost.\n\nThe actor used her Bolide to inject a bit of color into her outfit. She wore a long oatmeal sweater over a mid-length beige skirt and added a pair of pointy-toe T-strap flats. Even with a bold alligator bag on her arm, Jennifer Lawrence managed to make her parents’ night out ’fit look understated.",

    "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
    "content": "If you haven’t already visited the “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” exhibition at the Costume Institute, now might be a good time. Soon, a new piece will join the 200-plus garment exhibition (on display until September 2, 2024), and it’s a special one. Anna Wintour’s custom 2024 Met Gala look designed by Jonathan Anderson for Loewe will be installed across from the 1889 cape by Charles Frederick Worth that inspired it.\n\n“It was a privilege to work on this look for Anna for the Met Gala and to find the synergies between what we are doing presently at Loewe and the incredible craft of the sleeping beauties in the Costume Institute archives,” said Anderson. “It’s an honor to have one of my designs now live alongside Charles Frederick Worth’s cape in his Tulipes Hollandaises textile that inspired the piece.”\n\nThe installation of the custom look designed by Jonathan Anderson for Loewe at the Costume Institute\n\nOne of the major through lines of the exhibition is the reinterpretation of historical garments from the archives. Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute, explained the importance of the modern-day pieces living alongside the historical ones. “‘Sleeping Beauties’ endeavors to reawaken garments in the Costume Institute’s collection by reactivating their sensory qualities,” Bolton said. “The show unfolds as a series of case studies united by the theme of nature. Like fashion, nature depends on the widest sensory engagements for its fullest sensorial expressions. The comparison, however, does not end with the senses. In many ways, nature serves as the ultimate metaphor for fashion—its rebirth, renewal, and cyclicity, as well as its transience, ephemerality, and evanescence. The former qualities are reflected in the exhibition through the many garments that have been influenced by earlier styles.”\n\nOther side-by-side comparisons include an Alessandro Michele Gucci cape with clouds and sunbursts and an 1880s ball gown by Charles Frederick Worth, Dries Van Noten’s ensembles influenced by Worth’s Tulipes Hollandaises evening cloak, and Maria Grazia Chiuri’s New Junon evening dress inspired by Monsieur Dior’s original Junon gown.",

    "title": "These Are The 7 Highest Protein Foods",
    "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
    "content": "Looking to up your protein intake? Then it's time to focus on what you're putting on your plate. Eating an adequate amount of protein-rich foods can help with everything from satiety to blood sugar management, mood control to muscle growth (and repair), and healthy hormones, too. “Our body is made up of proteins, and it’s especially important to consume adequate amounts, especially as we age,” surgeon Dr David Luu confirms.\n\nRhian Stephenson, nutritionist and founder of Artah, previously told Vogue that she suggests aiming for 1.2g of protein per kilogram to avoid protein deficiency. That being said, starting at 0.75g and working your way up is a smart way to get there, too.\n\nFoods with the highest protein content\n\n“The best proteins—taking into account their composition and digestibility—would be those from animal sources,” says nutritionist Laura Parada. “But,” she cautions, “I advise eating a varied diet that includes proteins of all types, whether of animal or vegetable origin.” If you are vegetarian or vegan, we cover the best sources of protein (all animal-free) here.\n\nEggs (about 13g of protein per 100g)\n\nFish (between 18 and 25g of protein per 100g)\n\nSeafood (about 24g per 100g)\n\nLean meats such as chicken (27g of protein per 100g)\n\nRed meats such as beef (22g per 100g)\n\nDairy products such as milk, yogurt, or kefir (between 3 and 10g per 100g)\n\nCheeses (depending on the cheese: cottage cheese about 11g and Parmesan cheese 33g per 100g)\n\nWhile plant-based proteins are not bioavailable in the same way that animal proteins are, they do have myriad benefits. Not only are vegetarian and vegan sources of protein likely to be higher in fibre (crucial for digestive health and a flourishing gut microbiome), but they can also be combined to create a more well-rounded protein profile.\n\n“The quality of a protein source can be determined by the amount of protein it contains per 100g, the amount of essential amino acids in that protein and its digestibility,” Parada explains. “Plant proteins—such as those in cereals, legumes and nuts—are usually of lower quality than animal proteins due to their lower amino acid content and ratio.”",

    "content": "Transcript\n\nI can't be a Bon Jovi without good Italian food.\n\n[gentle elegant music]\n\nHi, everyone, it's Millie Bobby Brown\n\nand I am with Vogue today\n\nto serve not only a look, but actually a meal.\n\nI'm wearing a Dolce Archive.\n\nWho? Me.\n\nYeah, the ingredients for my paella are one pepper,\n\none onion, some garlic, chorizo, cubed chicken,\n\ncanned tomatoes, Arborio rice, saffron, and chicken stock.\n\nAnd then some spices, paprika, chili flakes,\n\ndepending on how spicy you like it.\n\nFirst, I thank the culinary gods.\n\nI say, Millie, you are gonna do\n\na great job today no matter what,\n\ndon't pressure on yourself.\n\nI'm gonna start off by dicing [giggles] some garlic.\n\nMy dad's a really good cook.\n\nMy mom doesn't really cook and my mom is here.\n\nShe's probably gonna be saying,\n\nI make a really good spaghetti bolognese.\n\nBut Mom, that's the only thing that you cook.\n\nDad has various different ingredients\n\nand he can just whip something up that makes total sense,\n\nbut you'd never think you'd put together.\n\nSo I learned probably from my dad.\n\nWe're gonna take this ring off.\n\nIt's all getting really serious.\n\nChop, chop, chop away. Get it really small.\n\nI hate the way when you chop garlic and you smell your...\n\nOoh, like I can't stand it.\n\nSo usually this is Jake's job. That feels about right.\n\nMy least favorite part of cooking.\n\nSometimes I cry, sometimes just I'm really hardcore.\n\nLet's see what happens today.\n\nBut let's really hope not\n\n'cause I've got a really strong eye look going on\n\nand I know people on here are gonna say,\n\nWhat are you doing cutting an onion like that?\n\nAnd I'm gonna say, I don't know what I'm doing,\n\nso I'm just gonna go in chop away.\n\nGuys, if you're ever wanting something\n\nto get just a tiny bit smaller\n\nand you're cooking, do my trick.\n\nOh, God. Do my trick.\n\nYou just...\n\n[knife chops]\n\nIt's such a great trick.\n\nIn my house, I put a big bowl on the table\n\nand I put all the leftovers and feed it to my chickens.\n\nThey love it.\n\nI have five hens. They are great.\n\nThey're all named off to the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich I heard Chappell Roan has chickens that are named\n\nafter the Spice Girls,\n\nwhich for me just feels like a segue\n\ninto a really close friendship.\n\nMy chickens, I had from babies, I raised them.\n\nI was actually told they were gonna die\n\nand then all of them survived.\n\nSo it's the power of love in Chappell Roan, I guess.\n\nChappell, if you're watching this,\n\nknow that our chickens could get along.\n\nPosh would like to meet Posh 2.0.\n\nOkay, I'm in a pretty good place\n\nwhere the onion is really diced.\n\nMy pepper, right down. Cut the head off.\n\nTake the inside. This is the part my chickens love the most.\n\nAlways save that part.\n\nI was full when I left Spain,\n\nso it's always been a part of my life.\n\nMy first memory ever,\n\nI had like a toy car that I would drive.\n\nIt was like a very small, you know, baby toy car.\n\nWe lived on a hill and in Spain, my dad can confirm\n\nor deny this, but I lost control\n\nand I was going down the hill and my dad was chasing\n\nafter me and like, I think that was my first memory.\n\nI was like a really clumsy kid.\n\nSo I would fall a lot, chip my teeth, slip my head open.\n\nYou know, it's all added to the creativity of\n\nwho I am today though,\n\nIt's all made me smarter.\n\nAt least that's what my mom tells me.\n\nSo I'm like actually getting shit done.\n\nWhereas usually I am on the phone\n\nwith my girlfriends dying laughing at some TikTok.\n\nAre we done with that? [sighs] Oh, my God, the chorizo.\n\nOkay, I hate, hate, hate cooking meat.\n\nLike it's my least favorite part of any cooking experience.\n\nAgain, leave that to my husband.\n\nBut here we are today,\n\nMillie has to overcome her fears.\n\nFYI, I don't usually do this,\n\nso I'm gonna cut that like that\n\nand then I'm just gonna open it like that.\n\nUgh, that feels right to me.\n\nNow it's just looking weird. Let's chop it up.\n\n[knife chops]\n\nActually the smell is so delicious.\n\nI do slice it 'cause I don't like...\n\nMy dad also is the same.\n\nWe don't like it to be too big\n\nand I usually just pile them on top just\n\nto make it go faster.\n\nSo we're now at a place where we have our diced veggies.\n\nWe have that, that thing.\n\nAnd we're going to use the stove now. Let's do it.\n\nLet's make magic happen. Voila.\n\nNow we have my stove.\n\nSo what I like to do is I like to start off\n\nby turning it on, medium heat, put some oil in.\n\nI will put my onions in, put my garlic in,\n\nand I'm gonna throw my saffron in the chicken stock\n\nto bloom it while I'm cooking.\n\nNow I'm going to add some salt.\n\nFor me, I loved baking in COVID\n\nand until I smell like it's walking,\n\nthen I kind of, that incentivizes me to keep going.\n\nIt starts to smell bad. That's when we put a roadblock.\n\nI'm very much just like go with the flow, just keep tasting\n\nas I go along and see if it needs more of anything.\n\nI'm gonna let this caramelized.\n\nAnytime anyone wants to kind of go out for dinner,\n\nI'm always like, Come over, and it feels more intimate.\n\nAnd it actually, I feel like my love for food is like a way\n\nof saying like, Thank you for coming over.\n\nSo now I'm just gonna throw in the red pepper.\n\nI'm gonna start with my least favorite part,\n\nwhich is cooking the meat.\n\nI have a very bad irrational fear\n\naround raw chicken and some might say,\n\nMillie, go be a vegetarian.\n\nAnd I'm gonna say to that, Yeah, I was a vegetarian\n\nfor a really long time, but I found out my body needs meat.\n\nEverybody's different.\n\nAnd that's what was happening with me.\n\nWe have olive oil, we have the chicken.\n\n[chicken sizzling]\n\nOnce it's cooked, I usually leave it in the bowl.\n\nI don't eat it. That's Jake always\n\nwhen we're like cleaning up after he goes,\n\nYou haven't even touched it.\n\nSo why do we put it in there?\n\nAnd I'm like, I know, I do this every time.\n\nBut it's for the enjoyment of my other guests.\n\nI want everybody else to enjoy the chicken,\n\nI just seemingly can't.\n\nWe're gonna add some salt and pepper.\n\nThis is my paprika.\n\nI'm gonna put a little bit in now to give some\n\nof the veggies some flavor.\n\nI mean, I was on Hell's Kitchen.\n\nYeah, that's right. I was the idiot sandwich.\n\nNo, I was a guest on there when I was like nine.\n\nI love Gordon. I love his whole family.\n\nOh, but Stanley Tucci's a good chef,\n\nbut I've never tried his food.\n\nSo invite me over, Stanley.\n\nAll right, something's happening.\n\nIt's definitely turning a different color.\n\nNext, we're going to add in that chorizo.\n\nSo here we go.\n\n[chorizo sizzling]\n\nI'm just gonna put in like not all of it.\n\nAnd I really like the chorizo really crispy.\n\nSo this is the part where I take the most time\n\nand make sure that it's like really crispy and delicious.\n\nNext, I'm gonna put in [giggles] my canned tomatoes.\n\nI'm just gonna pop this in.\n\nAnd this actually helps soften the vegetables.\n\nI just like to kind of mix this around, get it moving. Yum.\n\nJust wait, have faith in me. It's looking good.\n\nIt looks where it needs to be for me.\n\nIf you put it in the rice fast,\n\nit picks up all the flavors of the oils.\n\n[eye tinkles]\n\nWoo-hoo.\n\nI'm just gonna mix this together\n\nand I'm gonna add in chicken stock.\n\nSo I again like to do this kind of the same thing\n\nwith the paprika but do it intermittently\n\nbecause the rice really soaks up fast.\n\nAnd then you have to keep trying\n\nand make sure the rice is actually cooking\n\nand then you add more.\n\nI kind of play it by ear at this point.\n\nAnd you let the rice do the talking.\n\nNow I'm gonna put in the peas,\n\nI'm gonna put in the blooming saffron\n\nand I'm gonna put in the rest of my paprika.\n\nChef's kiss.\n\nLid is gonna go on top of this while this is cooking.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep looking at this in disappointment.\n\nThe wedding food process, I didn't do a tasting,\n\nI didn't do anything.\n\nOur caterer was Galateo, the most like renowned,\n\nbeautiful catering company in, honestly Europe.\n\nSo I was like, You got this.\n\nAnd to this day, guests at my wedding say,\n\nThere was a pasta dish that was like so amazing.\n\nWhat I really wanted the takeaway to be was\n\nthat the food was the best food\n\nthey've ever had at a wedding.\n\nAnd I am taking, taking that very proudly.\n\nI very much am not a trad wife, but I do love cooking\n\nand I love married life.\n\nI love cooking with my husband. Jake also loves the farm.\n\nHe also loves cooking like we're a trad couple,\n\nbut like a trendy trendy trad couple.\n\nSo now I'm going to pop the chicken in to the paella.\n\nProbably needs another like, honestly 15 minutes,\n\nbut we'll check like intermittently.\n\nSo what I would usually do at home is I would then go\n\nand let the dogs out, put my life jacket\n\non my English bulldog 'cause she really likes the pool,\n\nbut she doesn't realize that she can't swim.\n\nAll right, I'm gonna make you a drink. Let's do it.\n\nSo now I'm gonna show you my favorite drink,\n\nwhich is a Shirley Temple.\n\nI grew up in the industry always going to like fancy dinners\n\nand meeting fancy people.\n\nAnd to feel fancy myself, I would order a Shirley Temple.\n\nAnd now growing up and being 21,\n\nmy preference is always gonna be a Shirley Temple.\n\nI need a cold drink.\n\nLet's find like a really nice one to sit on top of that.\n\nYeah, that's what we wanna see.\n\nOkay, then I'm gonna do a splash.\n\nI like to do a squeeze of lime\n\nand then I like to fill it all the way up.\n\nOkay, I like to pop that in there.\n\nOne for me, one for the drink,\n\nand then I'm gonna use the back\n\nof a spoon just to get that grenadine.\n\nDoesn't that look so good? And guess what this doesn't do.\n\nLeave you questioning everything you did the night before.\n\nAlways choose Shirley. This is like the best drink ever.\n\nSo I'm very happy with this. Let's check the paella.\n\n[food sizzling]\n\nOh my gosh, it looks amazing.\n\nI'm gonna do a little taste test\n\nwith the same Shirley Temple spoon, just gonna...\n\nMy dad would like it, however, Jake wouldn't.\n\nSo I'm gonna pour some more of this on\n\nbecause the rice is still too hard.\n\nAnd then I'm just going to bring all\n\nof the sides into the middle.\n\nThis might be my segue into my cooking career.\n\nWe don't know, like I could be the next Stanley Tucci.\n\nWe're gonna let that do its thing again.\n\nAnd it's also gonna get crispy on the bottom,\n\nwhich is my favorite part of any paella.\n\nTas tas.\n\n[bell dings] Checking.\n\nThat's ready. All right, this is ready to be served.\n\nSo I'm gonna tidy up so we can get taste testing.\n\nAll right, we're back. I clearly had way too much fun.\n\nI'm gonna make another.\n\nThis time, I'm gonna put two cherries in.\n\nThe rest is Sprite.\n\nThe reveal. Here we go.\n\nThis is our paella. I'm gonna start in the middle.\n\nWhy not?\n\nNow I'm going to put a little bit of parsley.\n\nNot one flake went on there.\n\nA little lemon and voila, that is my paella.\n\nWow. I'm getting hints of saffron.\n\nI'm getting hints of tomato. This is delicious.\n\nGood job me.\n\nIt's all working. It's all giving.\n\nIt's all serving.\n\nMy kitchen at home does not look like this.\n\nAnd it usually has around 10 dogs running around me,\n\neating everything that falls on the ground.\n\nIt's just been a really peaceful, enjoyable experience.\n\nI love limes. You know, and Dakota's like, I love limes.\n\nI would like to take this home in memory\n\nof that amazing video.\n\nThanks so much for watching. Bye.\n\nI have a nephew and I perform popular to him.\n\nHe fully giggles and laughs\n\nat me playing Elphaba and Glinda for him.\n\nHe loves the power of Elphaba.\n\nLike he can really...\n\nHe feels it, but Glinda makes him laugh.\n\n[upbeat bright music]",

    "content": "While I don’t generally subscribe to partner archetypes, it can’t be argued that the golden retriever boyfriend is sui generis. I mean, Travis Kelce did not show up at all those Eras Tour concerts for his doglike devotion to girlfriend Taylor Swift to go unappreciated!\n\nBut what defines a golden retriever boyfriend, exactly? Below, find everything you need to know about the type, from his strengths to his flaws—plus, a tip on where to snap one up for yourself.\n\nWhere did the term “golden retriever boyfriend” come from?\n\nAs usual, we have TikTok to thank for the rise and rise of the golden retriever boyfriend. Various videos on the subject have defined this particular type of partner as one who’s sweet, silly, maybe not the most intellectual apple in the bunch (although by no means is the golden retriever boyfriend necessarily dumb!), and always willing to go the extra mile for the people he loves. Also, he’s probably kind of handsome in a classic, symmetrical way?\n\nBut golden retriever boyfriends are primarily defined by their loyalty; not only will they not cheat on you, but they’ll show up at that event you didn’t even remind anyone you were hosting, because you were sure everyone would end up skipping it. They might even bring you flowers! Will the flowers be daisies rather than priceless hothouse orchids? Maybe, but what’s wrong with daisies?\n\nTikTok content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWho are some prototypical golden retriever boyfriends?",

    "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
    "content": "What is A$AP Rocky going to do when Matthieu Blazy leaves Bottega Veneta?\n\nIn what is quite possibly Rocky’s Bottega swan song, the rapper has been spotted carrying some truly outrageous bags. Rocky, who has been spending time in the recording studio, has been trotting out an enviable bag collection, from a large white Andiamo to a truly enormous orange tote.\n\nThe famous dresser is a noted Bottega collector: Just days after sitting front row at the Bottega Veneta spring 2025 show, A$AP Rocky celebrated his birthday carrying a sneaky status bag. While it looked like any other plastic bag, it was really a fresh-off-the-runway leather trompe l’œil, straight from Milan—and the latest addition to his inimitable closet. Last year, the rapper celebrated his 35th birthday carrying a Pepto Bismol-hued Bottega Veneta Andiamo bag, made in the brand’s signature woven leather. (Rocky, who participated in a guerilla marketing campaign for Bottega, carried several of the brand’s telltale intrecciato bags over the course of his contract.)\n\nThe rapper has proven time and time again that he isn’t concerned with mens’ fashion norms when it comes to his personal style. Between his babushka scarf and leather skirt, A$ASP Rocky knows that gender norms are so passé. But nothing broadcasts his disinterest in gendered fashion more than his impressive purse collection, which he’s cultivated over the course of his career.\n\nBut his collection ranges far beyond Bottega. In August 2023, just after the birth of his second son Riot Rose, Rocky was spotted walking to his conspicuous yellow Hummer, dressed for a workout in a black J6 hoodie, Puma shorts, and black-and-green sneakers with white socks, carried a toting an open black Hermès Kelly with gold hardware. Between the open bag, contents on full display, and the little coffee cup he kept chugging from, the new father of two was giving a touch of Frazzled Englishwoman energy.\n\nWhile Rocky already had an impressive bag collection on his own, now that he’s one half of the world’s most fashionable couple, he has two closets to pull from. On a date night with Rihanna at Carbone, he paired a sky blue Goyard Saint Louis with his simple white tee, jeans, flannel, and puffer. The rapper is clearly a fan of Goyard: he’s also been spotted carrying a marigold yellow clutch, an orange tote, and blue satchel with a rose painted on the leather. And at the spring 2020 Gucci show in Milan, he wore a leather purse by the Italian house slung across his chest.",

It didn’t matter what she was doing or wearing: a chartreuse satin Prada top met its match with a lime green Bottega Veneta pouch bag; an orange version of the clutch stood in as a gym bag. In the nearly two years since, Bieber has embraced a litany of other purses, from top handles to shoulder bags, though it seems that she’s firmly back on team oversized clutch.\n\nHailey Bieber, 2023. Yolo / BACKGRID Hailey Bieber, 2023. GAMR/SPOT / BACKGRID\n\nLast night, Bieber joined Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner for dinner at Sushi Park in West Hollywood where she revived her pouch obsession. The Rhode Beauty entrepreneur kept her base look simple in a white tank top and low-slung, wide-legged indigo jeans that cascaded over a pair of black pointy-toe pumps. But she upped the glam factor with her outerwear: a white furry shin-length coat with black flecks. On the accessories front, she wore her handy-dandy slim Otra sunglasses, and carried her black envelope bag under her arm.\n\nHailey Bieber leaving Sushi Park, April 2025. BACKGRID Kendall and Kylie Jenner leaving Sushi Park after dinner with Hailey Bieber. BACKGRID\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen Bieber carrying this purse. Last week, she declared the outsized clutch to be a church bag, bringing it along to a post-worship date night at Giorgio Baldi with husband Justin Bieber.\n\nSo while this black bag is a bit more subtle than the citrus-hued pouches of yore, Hailey Bieber is—once again—all in on the oversized clutch.",

In this column, we’ll be examining the celebrity couples—or, occasionally, animal-kingdom singles—that give us hope for our own romantic futures and trying to learn what we can from their well-documented bonds.\n\nI know this column technically exists to celebrate the joys of Hollywood romance and friendship, but there’s a new protagonist to root for this spring, and she’s straight out of Philadelphia. Her name is Mommy, and she’s a critically endangered Galapagos tortoise who just became a first-time mother to four sweet little hatchlings at the tender age of 97. There’s a father in the picture too—his name is Abrazzo, which I believe is the Spanish word for “hug,” and he’s the Philadelphia Zoo’s other oldest inhabitant, making this the antithesis of an age-gap relationship—but as a currently childfree adult who’s fairly set on having kids late (if at all), I’m choosing to focus solely on Mommy in this moment of her record-breaking matrescence.\n\nNot only is Mommy the oldest first-time mom in her species’s known history, but she’s also a legendary queen in her own right. She’s been deemed “one of the most genetically valuable Galapagos tortoises in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ species survival plan,” per the Philadelphia Zoo, with its president and CEO, Jo-Elle Mogerman, adding that “Mommy arrived at the Zoo in 1932, meaning anyone that has visited the Zoo for the last 92 years has likely seen her. Philadelphia Zoo’s vision is that those hatchlings will be a part of a thriving population of Galapagos tortoises on our healthy planet 100 years from now.”",

While the jeans themselves are already a conversation starter, she opted to ramp up the look with not one, not two, but three iterations of snakeskin. She wore an oversized gray Fashion East bomber jacket from fall 2025, a slouchy shoulder bag, and a pair of pointy-toe heels.\n\nBACKGRID USA\n\nRihanna continued her maximalist streak yesterday morning during a grocery run, making even a gray sweatsuit look impossibly chic.

    "content": "Editor’s Note: As the news breaks that Pharrell Williams will be co-chair of the 2025 Met Gala, we have revisted and updated this analysis of his personal style.\n\nMonsieur Louis Vuitton might have been trunkmaker to an empress, but Pharrell Williams—who will made his debut at the French house in 2023—has even closer ties to royalty, having fashioned himself “son of a pharaoh.” In advance of that event Williams posted a picture of himself atop an LV pyramid of wood on Instagram. Was it a manifestation of the “room without a roof” he sings about in his hit song “Happy”?\n\nHaving walked runways and been a muse, collaborator, and designer, Williams is no stranger to fashion, or to Louis Vuitton. His relationship with the French luxury house dates back about 20 years. “Where it all started” is the caption he attached to a photo from 2004 in which he’s wearing a Louis Vuitton x Takashi Murakami scarf with a varsity jacket. Beyond that, there’s the 2006 “Say Somethin” video with Mariah Carey, shot in the Paris flagship store; the eyeglass collaboration for the house with Nigo; and the Blason jewelry collection of 2008. As the first collection proved, the creative director takes cues from his own closet. Though he shed some of his sartorial past through sales on his auction platform, Joopiter, the performer has a clear style identity that’s built around denim and messaging, motos and diamonds, and camo and cardigans. The creative director is loyal to the brands he’s (co)founded, Billionaire Boys Club, Icecream, and Humanrace, and to the companies he’s collaborated with, including Adidas. In addition to Louis Vuitton, in the past he’s worn a lot of Chanel and Comme des Garçons.\n\nWith a vibe that is casual but cool, and an emphasis on fabrics that have patina or soft textures, Williams introduces structure into his wardrobe via military-inspired garb and short suits. He also has a penchant for jewelry and a taste for statement shoes and the occasional topper. Who can forget the Buffalo hat, designed by Vivienne Westwood for World’s End, that he wore to the 2014 Grammy Awards? As with his music, Williams is able to work across genres to come up with something that is signature Pharrell.Here, an analysis of Williams’s personal style.\n\nBoth Sides Now\n\nWilliams has a 360-degree view of fashion, having been a model, muse, creator, and customer.",

    "content": "Last week, the best dressed stars on the red carpets and city streets rang in the official start of spring with vibrant colorways and playful textures, officially packing away outerwear and wintry layers to instead don diaphanous silhouettes and light-as-air dresses. And now, outside of the awards season and fashion month tumult, it’s certainly time for celebrities to experiment with their style.\n\nThe A-listers that descended on Las Vegas for the annual CinemaCon event brought a playful variety of ’fits. Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande dropped by The Colosseum at Caesars Palace to debut the trailer for Wicked: For Good, forgoing their method dressing beat for their own personal twists on the little black dress: Erivo in Alaïa’s spring 2025 collection and Grande in a drop-waist Emporio Armani dress. Elsewhere at the Sin City convention, Sydney Sweeney opted into Wiederhoeft’s “corset program” in a look that stayed in step with her signature, bombshell stylistic codes. Ayo Edebiri and Jenna Ortega both forewent the evening gown: Edebiri wore sleek and chic prada, while Ortega donned a Daphne from Scooby Doo-esque Versace lilac short suit. Teyana Taylor turned to Daniel Roseberry, but instead of the expected sculptural Schiaparelli dress, she chose a majestic maxi coat.\n\nThe talk show circuit was also an arena for great fashions: Severance’s Britt Lower continues to cultivate her refined yet playful approach to dressing with stylist Rose Forde, wearing a floor-length, cobalt blue sequin Conner Ives dress on the Jimmy Fallon couch—and to toot a trumpet. Aimee Lou Wood dropped by the Drew Barrymore Show in a long leather belted trench, keeping it cute with darling white socks and Mary Janes.\n\nAnd at this week’s premieres, the stars pulled out their great gowns (beautiful gowns…): Michelle Williams chose a romantic, plunging white Proenza Schouler dress with daring cut-out sides for the Dying For Sex screening in New York, while over in London, Caitriona Balfe looked to highlighter yellow Louis Vuitton to walk the red carpet for The Amateur’s premiere.\n\nWhich were your favorite celebrity looks this week?

    "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
    "content": "Not knowing what to wear is one thing, but having a strict dress code, like cocktail attire, splashed across an invite as you scramble for an outfit is another. It's a familiar scenario: You're invited to a wedding, an engagement party, or even just a nice get-together with friends, and the host requests this particular style of dress. It's not formal but certainly not casual–making the risk of doing too much or too little pretty high.\n\nWhile most of us know exactly what cocktail (or mocktail) hour is, the dressing piece of the occasion leaves a little more room for interpretation.\n\nWhat is cocktail attire?\n\nIn the simplest of terms, it's a semi-formal style of dress typically worn on early evening and late afternoon occasions. \"Cocktail attire was first popularized in the 1920s as women in the U.S. moved into the public social sphere and sought to find more individuality and shed the more confining gender stereotypes of the Edwardian era,\" Michelle Gabriel, graduate program director of Glasgow Caledonian New York College (GCNYC) tells Vogue. During the Edwardian era, women's dress was elaborate, including corsets, long skirts, and layers. In the decade following, the style of dress worn by flappers was a step in a more freeing direction with shorter hemlines and looser silhouettes, but still filled with the same level of detail and adornment.\n\n\"French couturiers like Chanel and Schiaparelli, increasingly dependent on American clients, took on the concept of cocktail dressing,\" Gabriel says. \"They offered luxurious loungy dressing for hostesses of private, high-class cocktail gatherings. Hollywood films featuring Mae West and Greta Garbo, and growing international travel of the 30s, helped to popularize these looks.\"\n\nStill, it wasn't until decades later that the name itself was popularized by none other than Christian Dior. At the time, cocktail hour was becoming the norm in households as women began to host parties between the hours of 6 P.M. and 8 P.M. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's website, \"Christian Dior was the first to name the early evening frock a \"cocktail\" dress in the late 1940s, and in doing so allowed magazines, department stores, and rival Parisian and American designers to promote fashion with cocktail-specific terminology.\" Dior's New Look collection, which included dresses and sets with cinched waistlines and voluminous skirts, defined a generation of style that was more versatile than ever before.",

    "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
    "content": "Photographed by Addy Campbell, GQ, May/April 2024\n\nDomingo attended his first Met Gala earlier this year, following an awards season that saw the actor’s bold, majestic style command red carpets and anoint him one of the best dressed men in Hollywood. Hamilton, a regular attendee since 2015, has transformed the once fashion-devoid Formula 1 paddocks into hotbeds of inspiration, arriving to the track in deftly styled looks from houses that often host him at their fashion shows (in the front row, of course). A$AP Rocky, meanwhile, finds himself lensed by street style photographers almost daily—his singular, distinct aesthetic surely on mood boards across the globe. 2025 will mark Williams’s sixth time at the Met Gala and second as co-chair; he previously assumed the role in 2017 for “Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between.” A boundless arbiter of fashion during his decades-long career in music, that influence continues today through Williams’s role as creative director of Louis Vuitton Men’s. Honorary chair James will be attending his first Met Gala, bringing with him an incomparable athletic legacy and an embrace of style that has helped fuel today’s unprecedented crossover between fashion and sports.\n\nChaired by Wintour since 1995, the Met Gala returns to New York City on May 5, 2025. The dress code will be announced in early 2025, and “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” will be on view May 6 through October 26, 2025. Mark your calendars.",

    "content": "March Madness may have ended with UConn besting the 2024 champions, South Carolina, in the title game. But while South Carolina may not have been able to claim the title for a second year in a row, coach Dawn Staley took home the Best Dressed award. Staley lived up to the “Louis Vuitton Dawn” name during the finals, donning a black sweatsuit embellished with turquoise studs. The detail-oriented dresser also opted for a pair of black LV sneakers smatterd with the multicolored monogram.\n\nOver the course of March Madness, Staley proved that comfort and fashion go hand-in-hand on the court. Sure, she may often be decked out in sweats, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be chic. When the Gamecocks took on the Duke Blue Devils in the Elite Eight, Staley wore head-to-toe Chanel, and she rocked Louis Vuitton during games against the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles and Maryland Terrapins. Beyond Staley, the tournament proved an opportunity for the NCAA coaches to show off their fashion alongside their basketball prowess.\n\nWhile Notre Dame may not have made it past the Sweet Sixteen round, head coach Niele Ivey caught our attention by twinning with none other than Rihanna. Ivey watched on from the sidelines as the Fighting Irish took on the Michigan Wolverines, dressed in a green crocodile-printed silk set from Balenciaga—a button-up blouse tucked into a pair of flowing palazzo pants. But that’s not where Ivey’s look ended. Watching on, she sat crouched in a pair of teetering knifepoint Christian Louboutin stilettos. (Once an athlete, always an athlete!)\n\nPerhaps nobody is more famous for their courtside style than Louisiana State University coach Kim Mulkey. Though LSU was bested by UCLA during the Elite Eight round, Mulkey managed to stand out on multiple occasions. During the Sweet Sixteen round, the head coach wore an indigo denim Alice + Olivia set—a military jacket and extreme flares embroidered with gold flowers. Mulkey wasn’t the only coach who embraced Alice + Olivia’s flamboyant styles from the sidelines: University of Arizona coach Adia Barnes also opted for a white pantsuit covered in a statement-making, outsized blue toile.\n\nBelow, look back at the most stylish coaches from March Madness. While none of them took home the title this year, they can rest easy knowing they will always have their fashion sense.",

    "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
    "content": "Let’s be honest: sister dressing isn’t for everyone. It can take us back to the days of stiff family photos and special occasionwear. But the sisters of the band Haim—Este, Danielle, and Alana—have mastered the art of coordination to the point that it could sway even the biggest naysayers.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that a family band like Haim would have the coordinated dressing down pat, but over the last 10-plus years, the trio have made a very solid case for matching clothing when you already have matching genetics. While downright matching has its time and place (as they demonstrated in Louis Vuitton minidresses at the Barbie premiere or suits and ties at the 2022 Glamour Women Of The Year Awards), the sisters have their style down to a science.\n\nIn order to maintain cohesion, the Haim sisters tend to center their looks around one unifying texture, color palette, or silhouette. Like with their music, they share the spotlight with ease, blending into the collective. But that doesn’t mean their individuality disappears: that each outfit succeeds alone and in the group is the true marker of success. Take the periwinkle Prada numbers they trotted out for the 2021 Grammys, each of them in mod shift dresses, Este wearing hers with a hole-riddled turtleneck; Danielle with trousers; Alana with trousers and an overcoat.\n\nNicolas Ghesquière seems to understand the trio’s sister dressing brief. The musicians, regulars at Louis Vuitton shows, often turn to the designer to dress them from everything from their tour (where they wore matching black bralettes and leather LV pants—heavy on the hardware) to the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party, where they align on one theme. (In 2025, they all donned dresses in ruched, copper-toned satin; in 2024 it was black and rhinestones that served as a jumping-off point.)\n\nWhether they’re leaning into the matchy-matchy or offering their own interpretations on a loose theme, Este, Danielle, and Alana Haim will make you want to match with your sister—or wish you had one. Here, see some of their finest sister style moments.",

    "content": "Transcript\n\nHey Vogue, it's Millie Bobby Brown\n\nand this is what's in my bag.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI'm gonna guess 12 items, but it's a big bag.\n\nThis is like my work bag so we don't know what's in here.\n\nWe're gonna find out.\n\nI keep my portable fan on me at all times.\n\nI get hot a lot\n\nand I like to be able to just have\n\nthis really natural gust of wind created\n\nby my bedazzled pink fan.\n\nIt's my biggest fan.\n\nI also find that when I'm under lights and studios,\n\nit's really great to be able to have a fan\n\nbecause I get really warm.\n\nSo item one.\n\nNext item, tea.\n\nPG tips, no matter where I go,\n\nalways a cup of tea on hand.\n\nVery English.\n\nI like a builder's brew,\n\nso it's a bit stronger.\n\nI do just a splash of milk, two sugars,\n\nand I leave the tea bag in like a true Brit.\n\nMy snack, dried mango.\n\nI like when it's all stuck together.\n\nI know it sounds weird,\n\nbut like it's like sweeter that way.\n\nI mean it's better than like candy you know.\n\nA bedazzled cup.\n\nI can't, I will not drink out of another cup.\n\nI have this everywhere.\n\nAnd as you can tell, I am Belinda,\n\nbut this I feel like makes me drink more water.\n\nLike, oh, shiny pink.\n\nOkay, I'll drink it.\n\nAll right.\n\nSome might say I am crazy, I don't think so.\n\nThis is a portable diffuser and I put this in my car.\n\nI put it everywhere I go.\n\nI put essential oils in it and water\n\nand then it just makes the room smell really great.\n\nI like to go for peppermint or eucalyptus.\n\nEucalyptus because of like I need energizing\n\na lot of the time.\n\nSo this is where it's at.\n\nIt's not a lot of pink, it's not that much pink.\n\nOkay, it's a lot of pink.\n\nSpeaking of pink, I don't go anywhere\n\nwithout my bedazzled mirror.\n\nOh, this is looking crazy, isn't it?\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay, well, hey,\n\nwhen I wanna just make sure like a contact crisis,\n\nsometimes I need to look in my eye.\n\nThis is great, little touch up mirror.\n\nThis I think has been bedazzled individually.\n\nHowever, this is a lie.\n\nThis is a sheet of bedazzle mint,\n\nwhich is not okay.\n\nThat's hideodious.\n\nAll right, I promise you there is no more pink.\n\nSpot to spot patches.\n\nLove these.\n\nAnd these are acne patches.\n\nI am obsessed with these, they're infused with tea tree oil.\n\nAnd when your girl is getting a pimple,\n\nwhich actually is located about right here,\n\nbut you can't see it right now\n\nbecause of the, maybe you can, I don't know, good makeup.\n\nI have a pimple that I would be treating with this after.\n\nThey're really cute and stylish too.\n\nSo I always keep these in my bag\n\nbecause I'm either using them\n\nor everyone around me is using them.\n\nSo I actually have my scarf that I've been working on.\n\nI have been working on this\n\nfor the majority of the press tour.\n\nAnd what I love about knitting\n\nand I started only like, gosh, six months ago.\n\nHold on, I've gotta find this loop.\n\nIt shows where I was in the time.\n\nSo I started this three weeks ago,\n\nI was at home watching TV.\n\nSo these are pretty clean, these are pretty clean stitches.\n\nAnd then you start getting into like\n\nwhen I was on my 21st birthday.\n\nSo they're becoming a little tighter\n\nbecause I was probably a little like stressed.\n\nSo I make the stitches a little tighter.\n\nAnd then right here is where they get looser\n\nbecause that's when I'm on planes and I'm tired.\n\nSo I start to get a little lazy.\n\nWhat I do is I get my needle\n\nand I go behind the stitch right here.\n\nAnd then I loop with more yarn, I guess, around the needle.\n\nAnd when I do that, I pull it apart like this\n\nand I go under the stitch, pull it over\n\nand pull it onto the next one.\n\nSo I'm creating a new row.\n\nThat's what I'm working on\n\nand I take this everywhere I go with me.\n\nAnd I do it always in hair and makeup\n\ninstead of doom scrolling or all those terrible things.\n\nActually find something else to do with your hands.\n\nAnd that's a great one.\n\nI have the essential oil that I use, this is De Stress.\n\nSo I'm guessing this is, let me just smell it.\n\nYeah, that's eucalyptus, that's for the diffuser.\n\nKind of random.\n\nBut I carry a microchip scanner with me\n\nwhich scans dogs, scans their microchip numbers\n\non their back.\n\nSo when I find stray dogs, stray cats,\n\nI check if they have a microchip.\n\nIf they do, that's great\n\nbecause usually that means they have a home.\n\nIf they don't have one, then I'm able to take them\n\nto the shelter, get them registered,\n\nand then take them to my rescue\n\nwhere I can microchip them, vaccinate them\n\nand get them into our facility\n\nso that we're able to find them a home.\n\nSo these are great.\n\nI don't have one.\n\nLet's see if I do.\n\nI don't have a microchip,\n\nbut I do have a home so it's fine.\n\nI started fostering dogs\n\nand then I had like 20 dogs at a time.\n\nSo I was taking these dogs from different situations\n\nand then I realized, oh, maybe I need to start a rescue.\n\nSo now Joey's Friends Rescue,\n\nall of the dogs basically have come through my house,\n\neither sleep in my bed at some point.\n\nI vaccinate them myself, I microchip them myself.\n\nWe have one right now Mama\n\nwho is gaining way too much weight.\n\nOver 230 dogs I have saved so far.\n\nIt's amazing.\n\nOkay, next.\n\nMy phone.\n\nBoring but true.\n\nMost use app on my phone is Maps.\n\nIs that so sad?\n\nI clearly have no idea where I'm going so.\n\n[Milly laughing]\n\nOkay.\n\nThis is by Florence by Mills.\n\nI actually love, I always keep this in my bag.\n\nCoastal chic hair and body mist, I love this.\n\nI had the coastal chic one for my birthday trip\n\nbecause I was on a beach, so I loved this one.\n\nI put it on my hair, I put it on my body\n\nbecause I didn't really like smelling like sunscreen.\n\n21st birthday was great, I loved it.\n\nI was able to play mermaids with my girlfriends\n\nand we just had like the best silliest time.\n\nWe played hide and seek.\n\nWe were just like having the best time.\n\nI loved it.\n\nTwo things, I'll bring them out at the same time.\n\nMy glasses, I can't see anything.\n\nI always bring an extra pair of contacts with me\n\neverywhere I go because if I have to do a crying scene,\n\nwhich I know that sounds silly,\n\nbut my contacts fall out of my face\n\nwhen I'm doing crying scenes.\n\nAnd then my sunglasses, if there's ever paparazzi\n\nor it's sunny, but mostly because there's paparazzi.\n\nI'm like, eh, I don't wanna talk.\n\nThe only time I've gotten away with it\n\nis like a wig, sunglasses.\n\nBut it has to be like a wig color\n\nthat nobody's ever seen me in like,\n\nbecause the blonde doesn't work.\n\nI've even had black hair, I've had red hair in my movie.\n\nSo I really have to go like pink,\n\nwhich doesn't feel like it draws that much attention.\n\nPoop bags for myself.\n\nI'm just kidding.\n\nFor my dogs, I hate to be that person\n\nthat like if I see someone on the struggle bus,\n\nI'm like, do you need one?\n\nLike I got one for you.\n\nSo try to help the dog community where I can,\n\nthis you need it.\n\nI have 10 personal dogs, Barbie, Molly, Max\n\nand then I have Teddy,\n\nand then I have Dorothy, Jimmy, Agnes, Pookie, Juno\n\nand Rigby.\n\nThose are my 10 dogs.\n\nDid I name Winnie?\n\nSo I have 11.\n\nAfter Jimmy Fallon, she got really big headed\n\nand she asked to be referred to as a human\n\nso now I'm not able to like say her in like the dog list.\n\nShe likes to be, she is a human.\n\nAnd honestly she thinks that Jake's this bad person\n\nin the house.\n\nShe's like, who is this bad person?\n\nLike why is he here?\n\nI'm scared of Winnie, everyone is.\n\nMy pillow spray, my favorite thing ever.\n\nI take it everywhere with me.\n\nI seemingly just cannot go to sleep without a pillow spray.\n\nAnd actually it's really funny because I get into bed\n\nand I spray it on my pillow.\n\nJake's already smiling.\n\nI spray it but like every time without a doubt,\n\nhe goes-\n\n[Millie coughing]\n\nSo dramatically.\n\nAnd I'm like, Are you okay?\n\nAnd I like spray he's like-\n\n[Milly coughing]\n\nYou're trying to kill me with that thing.\n\nI'm like, it's a pillow spray, get a grip.\n\nSo now I think I am like kind of aiming for him\n\nand the pillow when I spray.\n\nJake, do you wanna defend yourself?\n\n[Jake] Well, you spray me in the eyes\n\nevery time you do it.\n\n[bottle sprays]\n\nDo you see that?\n\n[bottle sprays]\n\nIt's a great spray.\n\nIt's not the sprayer, it's the spray.\n\nDon't blame the sprayer, blame the spray.\n\nOkay, what else?\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIf I could have anyone in my bag, by anyone,\n\nI mean a human, it would be Winnie.\n\nThanks guys, that's everything that's in my bag.\n\nSee you soon.\n\nWaddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle.\n\n[upbeat music]",

[laughs]\n\nI do remember this.\n\nThis was taken by the wonderful Bert Stern\n\nwho, in the '50s and '60s,\n\nI think he was one of the biggest fashion photographers.\n\nAnd, actually, my first trip to New York,\n\nhe came on board to do a documentary of my trip.\n\nAnd I think there's a series of me pulling faces like this,\n\nkind of scrunching my nose up and going like that,\n\nand this one with my mouth open.\n\nIt's kind of been around a long time.\n\nBut he was such a brilliant man, a lovely photographer.\n\nThat first year of modeling\n\nafter I was discovered in February '66,\n\nwas like a whirlwind.\n\nI was a schoolgirl, and I was a mod.\n\nI used to do makeup at weekends\n\nand I devised that makeup and I became a model,\n\nwhich was three pairs of eyelashes on top,\n\nthe drawn ones underneath,\n\nwhich I got the idea from a ragdoll\n\nthat I had in my bedroom.\n\nSomebody had a friend of a friend who worked on a magazine\n\nand said, I think you should go and meet this woman,\n\n'cause I think you could maybe model.\n\nSo I met this woman.\n\nI was quite upset really,\n\n'cause she said, You'll never really make a model,\n\n'cause you're too small and you're much too slim.\n\nAnd so, I think I cried\n\non the way home on the bus. [chuckles]\n\nBut she said, I'm gonna do some test shots of your face,\n\n'cause you've got a very interesting face,\n\nbut your hair's a mess, 'cause I used to do it myself.\n\nAnd she sent me to this hairdressers called Leonard,\n\nwhich was a very posh salon in Mayfair, in London.\n\nI was gonna just have my hair styled for the photographs,\n\nand Leonard happened to be in that day,\n\nand he saw me across the salon\n\nand came over and said, Can I cut your hair?\n\nAnd I went back the next day\n\nand he did the now very well known haircut\n\nthat kind of launched me, really.\n\nHe hung the photograph\n\nthat Barry Lategan took of this haircut in his salon,\n\nand big journalist of the day, Deirdre McSharry,\n\nwho worked for the Daily Express\n\nsaid, I love the haircut.\n\nWho's the girl?\n\nI've never seen her before.\n\nAnd she said, I wanna meet her.\n\nSo I got a call at my home\n\nsaying would I go up for an interview?\n\nAnd she said, I'm gonna write an article about you.\n\nAnd I already had the nickname Twiggy,\n\n'cause my legs were so skinny.\n\nAbout three weeks later,\n\nit was a big page in the Daily Express\n\nsaying Twiggy the Face of '66.\n\nAnd, on that day in February,\n\nmy life changed forever. [chuckles]\n\nOh, it's another Bert.\n\nThis is April 15th, so that would be 1967.\n\nI think this is my first ever American Vogue cover.\n\nSo it's my first Vogue cover,\n\nbecause I worked for American Vogue\n\nbefore I worked for British Vogue.\n\nAnd that was because Diana Vreeland,\n\nwho was the fashion editor of American Vogue in those days,\n\nand she was, like, the queen of fashion.\n\nI mean, whatever Diana Vreeland said was it.\n\nAnd she brought me over from the UK to America,\n\nand really changed my life.\n\nI always say that Diana Vreeland turned me global.\n\nOh! [laughs]\n\nThis is funny.\n\nThis, I was approached to do a line of clothing\n\nby manufacturers.\n\nAnd I think this is the little fashion show\n\nthat I did in the showroom,\n\nbecause all the press photographers are there,\n\nof my first collection of Twiggy dresses.\n\nI loved doing that.\n\nIt was like a dream come true,\n\nbecause, if what happened to me hadn't happened,\n\nwhat I wanted to do, I wanted to go to art school\n\nand I wanted to study fashion and design,\n\n'cause I wanted to be a fashion designer.\n\nSo, I got two wishes;\n\nI got to be a model, and I got to work on a collection.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nOh, this is interesting.\n\nThis is from a series of photographs\n\ntaken by another great photographer, Melvin Sokolsky.\n\nAnd, on my first trip to New York in '67,\n\nI was hired to do photographs of clothing range.\n\nIt was a fabric company,\n\nand Melvin was taking the photographs,\n\nand he wanted to do me all in different places in New York,\n\nlike at the zoo,\n\nand this was with builders on a building site,\n\nand coming outside of a department store,\n\nand up the Empire State Building.\n\nAnd the first day we went out, a crowd would gather,\n\nbecause what had happened, I had arrived in New York,\n\nit was my first trip to New York,\n\nand I'd come in after The Beatles,\n\nI was part of the British invasion. [chuckles]\n\nSo people had seen me arriving at the airport,\n\n'cause there was a press conference and crowds of girls.\n\nI mean, I was overwhelmed by it all.\n\nI'd gone in to do a fashion shoot,\n\nand I had all this press coverage.\n\nWhen we went out and Melvin was taking the pictures,\n\na crowd would gather,\n\nand he would try and disperse them,\n\nbut they kept coming back.\n\nSo he had this idea,\n\nhe took me back to the studio\n\nand took photos of my face in black-and-white,\n\nwhich they made masks of, which you can see here.\n\nSo, wherever we were in New York, when a crowd gathers,\n\nhe just gave out the masks,\n\nand the plan was to collect them back every day\n\nand use them the next day,\n\nbut people wouldn't give them back,\n\nthey were keeping them as a souvenir.\n\nAnd, actually, it won them,\n\nI think, best advertising campaign of the year, I think.\n\nIt was an amazing time.\n\nAh!\n\nI love this photograph, actually.\n\nThis was taken by Richard Avedon.\n\nIt is July, it says there,\n\nso it must have been July, 1967\n\non that first big trip to New York.\n\nThey had the idea to paint this flower on my face,\n\nit's beautiful actually,\n\nand slick my hair back.\n\nOver the years, a lot of people,\n\nthey've done copies of this photograph,\n\nwith famous actresses, recreated it.\n\nBut it's a beautiful photograph.\n\nOh.\n\nI remember this very well.\n\nThis is from my first movie called The Boy Friend,\n\nin which I played the lead girl called Polly Browne,\n\nand it was directed by Ken Russell.\n\nThere's a scene in it\n\nwhere it's a song called Poor Little Pierrette.\n\nSo I've got a pierrette and pierrot outfit on\n\nwith the little ballet slippers,\n\nand the white clown face.\n\nHis wife, Shirley Russell did all the costume,\n\nand she was absolutely brilliant.\n\nShe did all the costumes for all his films,\n\nand she was amazing.\n\nAnd all my clothes in The Boy Friend,\n\nthey're so beautiful,\n\nbecause they're all like 1920s, '30s.\n\nThey're absolutely gorgeous.\n\nI think I was like 18 and a half when we started filming.\n\nIt came out I think in '70 or '71,\n\nand I won two Golden Globe Awards for it.\n\nAnd it changed my life,\n\nbecause, from then on,\n\nI decided I didn't wanna model anymore,\n\nI wanted to pursue this acting musical career, which I did.\n\nAh.\n\nThe Bowie Pin Ups photograph.\n\nThis is interesting, actually,\n\nbecause I got a call from British Vogue\n\nabout doing a photograph with David Bowie.\n\nThis must have been probably early '70s.\n\nYou've gotta remember that Bowie was enormous.\n\nHe was the biggest pop star\n\ncertainly in the UK and probably in the world,\n\nand I was a huge, huge fan.\n\nAnd a couple of years earlier,\n\nI'd been at home and on the radio,\n\nyou know, they were playing pop music,\n\nand his new single came out\n\nand it was called Drive-In Saturday,\n\nand there's a line in it where he says\n\nShe'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid,\n\nand I was like, Oh my God.\n\nDavid Bowie just said my name in a song.\n\nI was like, Oh I was so...\n\n'Cause I loved him, I thought he was brilliant.\n\nAnd then, a few months later, I got the call\n\nsaying would I'd be up for doing a photograph\n\nfor the cover of Vogue with Bowie?\n\nAnd I said, Absolutely, I'd love it,\n\n'cause I'd never met him.\n\nHe was, at the time, in Paris recording the Pin Ups album.\n\nSo I went to Paris and met him.\n\nAnd, you know, he was just amazing man,\n\nso bright, so clever, so modest,\n\njust a really great guy,\n\napart from being incredibly talented.\n\nAnd we got on really well.\n\nWe did the photograph, I went back to London,\n\nand then the then editor said,\n\nWe can't put a man on the cover of British Vogue.\n\nThey wouldn't budge.\n\nSo while we were going back and forth with them,\n\nDavid said, Why don't I just put it on the cover\n\nof my album?\n\nWhich he did,\n\nso it became the cover of Pin Ups,\n\nand it's had a much longer life, actually,\n\nbecause every time it's reissued in a different format,\n\nout comes the cover of Pin Ups. [laughs]\n\nAw!\n\nAw, that's happy memories.\n\nThis is taken in the Big Biba store.\n\nNow, Biba, for those who don't know,\n\nI think most people in fashion do know,\n\nBiba was the dream place to go and shop\n\nin the mid '60s, late 60's, into the early '70s.\n\nBiba was the first place in London\n\nthat you could buy affordable clothes for young people.\n\nAnd Biba was the inspiration\n\nof a wonderful, wonderful lady\n\nwho was one of my dear, dear friends,\n\nI love her so much, Barbara Hulanicki.\n\nAnd Barbara brought Biba to London.\n\nThis is one of the photographs taken in the Big Biba,\n\n'cause it went from a tiny boutique to a mid-size boutique,\n\nand then they took over a department store,\n\nand it was one of the most beautiful department stores\n\nin the world.\n\nBut I love this, 'cause it's my memory of Barbara.\n\nOh gosh!\n\nIn 1983, I was doing a big Broadway musical\n\ncalled My One and Only with Tommy Tune.\n\nThis was the night of the Tony Awards,\n\nand I had this dress made.\n\nActually, it's very high-cut.\n\nI've just... [laughs].\n\nI just went to a dress maker, I did a drawing,\n\nand I said, Can you make this?\n\nAnd I had the points here that go over the finger.\n\nSo I love my hair.\n\nI think I did that by braiding it the night before.\n\nBut it was a great night.\n\nI mean, it's always a great night,\n\nyou know, it's the biggest night for theater in New York.\n\nOh.\n\nThis must be another pap shot.\n\nThis is the mid '90s Drama League Awards,\n\nwhich I think are in New York.\n\nBut it's interesting\n\nbecause my signature look has mostly been,\n\nif I go back to look at the clothes that I love,\n\nI love that boyish kind of look,\n\nmen's trouser suits.\n\nYou couldn't get men's suits for women in those days.\n\nSo I went to a tailor called Tommy Nutter in Savile Row.\n\nHe was one of my friends\n\nand one of the great tailors of that era.\n\nAnd he used to make me, you know, boy suits\n\nwith waistcoats and trousers and the jacket.\n\nAnd this is a kind of,\n\nI don't think this is a Tommy Nutter,\n\nbut it's that kind of look.\n\nSo I've always loved that look.\n\nOh!\n\nWell, this one's interesting.\n\nSo this is early '90s.\n\nSo, bear in mind that I kind of quit modeling\n\nwhen I started doing The Boy Friend.\n\nSo, in 1970, I decided I wasn't gonna model anymore.\n\nI wanted to pursue my performing career.\n\nIn the early '90s,\n\nI got a call through my agent\n\nfrom a wonderful photographer called Steven Meisel.\n\nHe wanted to do a 10-page spread with me for Italian Vogue.\n\nI flew to New York, and we did this amazing spread.\n\nBut the funny thing\n\nis that I got to the studio in New York ahead of him,\n\nI was in makeup and hair,\n\nand he came in to say hello.\n\nI got up and said, Oh, it's so lovely to meet you,\n\nI'm a huge fan, and thank you for asking to do it.\n\nAnd he said, We've met before.\n\nAnd I went, Oh my God, I'm so...\n\nI don't remember.\n\nWhen did we meet? I don't remember.\n\nHe said, No, you wouldn't remember.\n\nHe said that I was 12. [laughs]\n\nAnd what had happened,\n\nwhen I first went to New York in 1967,\n\nhe was a 12-year-old boy, he lived in New Jersey,\n\nand he'd seen on the TV that I'd arrived in New York.\n\nHe and his friend decided they wanted to come and meet me.\n\nSo they took the day off school,\n\nthey got the ferry over from New Jersey to New York,\n\nthey found where Melvin Sokolsky studio was,\n\nthey rang the doorbell.\n\nAnd at the time,\n\nI was being filmed for the Bert Stern documentary.\n\nAnd somebody answered the door\n\nand they said, We wanna meet Twiggy,\n\nand the person said, No, you can't, go away.\n\nAnd the director of the documentary said,\n\nNo, no, bring them up.\n\nIt'd be good footage.\n\nSo these two young boys came out,\n\nI came out.\n\nNow, I don't remember this, and I told Steven that.\n\nHe said, You came out of the dressing room,\n\nand I said, Oh, I hope I was nice to you,\n\nand he said, No, you were lovely.\n\nAnd I signed pictures for them, and we chatted,\n\nand they went away really happy, apparently.\n\nAnd, apparently, he said to his friend\n\non the ferry back to New Jersey,\n\nhe said, One day, I'm gonna photograph her,\n\n'cause he'd always wanted to be a photographer.\n\nSo it took from 1967 to 1992, or whatever it was,\n\nfor him to photograph me,\n\nbut I just thought it was such a sweet story.\n\nAw, me and Kate.\n\nThis is by Solve Sundsbo,\n\nI hope I've pronounced that properly,\n\nhe's a Scandinavian photographer, wonderful photographer.\n\nAnd we were doing a shoot for i-D Magazine,\n\nand they were photographing all different models\n\nfrom different eras.\n\nAnd the day I was booked to go in,\n\nKate Moss was in.\n\nSo she was in in the morning and we overlapped,\n\nI went into makeup and Kate was having her photograph taken.\n\nAnd then Solve came to me and said,\n\nAs you're both here today,\n\nit would be lovely to get a picture of you together.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAnd I said, Well, I'd love it, I'm game for it.\n\nAnd he asked Kate, and she said,\n\nOh, yeah, that'd be great.\n\nI love the way she's leaning on me, it's brilliant.\n\nI love Kate, she's so lovely.\n\nAnd it's interesting,\n\nbecause we're both kind of the same height,\n\nI mean, she's obviously much younger than me.\n\nBut, you know, when I hit in the '60s,\n\nI wouldn't have been taken by a model agency,\n\n'cause I was too small and too thin.\n\nWhen what happened to me happened,\n\nit changed the criteria\n\nof what agencies would take girls on for.\n\nAnd Kate came along two decades later,\n\nand was very similar size and shape to me, when I began.\n\nAnd, you know, she's one of the great models,\n\nand one of the nicest girls in the world.\n\nI love her.\n\nOh, I remember this day.\n\nI won't forget this day,\n\nas long as I live, I don't think.\n\nI'm in a beautiful Stella McCartney suit that she made me\n\nand a hat,\n\nthat, funny enough, the little hat,\n\n'cause this is at the Palace, when I got my Damehood.\n\nThe hat, I went shopping\n\nwith my daughter and my granddaughter,\n\nand my granddaughter picked this hat.\n\nI think she was about...\n\nOh, she was quite little, about four or five.\n\nYou're meant to wear a hat at the Palace, so...\n\nI'll never forget the day.\n\nThey don't let you know that you're gonna be offered one.\n\nAnd I remember the day the letter came,\n\na few months before the ceremony.\n\nAnd it's a very official letter.\n\n[chuckles] I think my first thought was,\n\nOh my God, is it a tax letter, you know?\n\nNot that it should be, 'cause I pay my taxes.\n\nIt was just like, Oh, what's this?\n\nIt's very official.\n\nAnd when I opened it,\n\nit's all in very kind of legalese language.\n\nI thought it was saying that I'd got a CBE,\n\nwhich, you know, I was thrilled about,\n\nI just couldn't believe it.\n\nAt the bottom of the letter it said,\n\nIf you ring this number,\n\nthere'd be somebody you can talk to and ask question.\n\nSo I rang this nice lady\n\nand I said, you know, It's Twiggy here,\n\nI've just got my letter.\n\nAm I right in understanding it's a CBE\n\nthat I'm being offered by the Palace?\n\nAnd she said, No, no, it's a Damehood.\n\nI went, Oh my goodness. [laughs]\n\nShe said, I think you better sit down\n\nand make yourself a nice gin and tea. [laughs]\n\nI mean, I don't like gin, actually,\n\nbut it was given to me by the then Prince Charles,\n\nand now King Charles.\n\nWhen he pinned it on my jacket,\n\nhe said, It's about time you got this,\n\nwhich I thought was very sweet.\n\nAw!\n\nThis is the first poster for our film Twiggy,\n\nwhich is a documentary directed by Sadie Frost on my life.\n\nIt's just been released nationwide.\n\nIt happened because Sadie Frost,\n\nwho's a wonderful actress,\n\nand she's been a model and various things,\n\nand about three years ago,\n\nshe did a beautiful documentary on Mary Quant,\n\nand I do a podcast called Tea with Twiggy,\n\nand her people asked\n\nif she could come on to promote Quant.\n\nSo I said, Brilliant.\n\nShe came on the podcast, got on really well,\n\nand I said to her,\n\nAre you gonna do any other documentaries?\n\nAnd she said, I'd love to do another one.\n\nAnd she said, I loved doing Mary Quant,\n\nbecause I love doing all the stuff from the '60s,\n\nand getting all the archives,\n\nand it's such a great period.\n\nSo I'd like to find somebody\n\nthat worked within the '60s era.\n\nAnd then she said, Oh, I should do you. [chuckles]\n\nSo I kind of said, Oh, okay.\n\nWell, let's talk about it off camera.\n\nSo, the following week, we went out to lunch.\n\nAnd it's worked out brilliantly,\n\nand we had the premier a couple of weeks ago,\n\nand it's gone down a storm.\n\nSo I'm really happy for Sadie, I'm happy for me,\n\nand it's been a very happy experience.\n\nAnd I love that photo.\n\nAgain, that's an old photograph, but it's a nice poster.\n\nMost people have a photo album of their lives,\n\nbut to actually [chuckles] see your life unfold\n\nin front of you on a big screen,\n\nit's very emotional.\n\nYou know, it's interesting looking at these photographs,\n\nbecause I've done lots and lots of different things,\n\nI still continue to do lots of different things,\n\nand I think that's what's kept me\n\nkind of interested in my career,\n\nbecause I didn't stick to just modeling.\n\nBut it was because I met people\n\nwho gave me the chance to do other things.\n\nI think I was so young when I was discovered\n\nthat I was kind of thrown into that spotlight.\n\nI've had an amazing life, amazing career,\n\nI'm not moaning about it. [laughs]\n\nThis is Twiggy, and this has been my Life in Looks,\n\nand it's been amazing to look back.\n\nVery, very happy memories.\n\n[intriguing mellow orchestral music]",

    "title": "“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” Is the Costume Institute’s Spring 2025 Exhibition",
    "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
    "content": "The exhibition will be arranged by 12 characteristics of Black dandyism, an organizational principle informed by a 1934 Zora Neale Hurston essay, “The Characteristics of Negro Expression.” The sections will tell the story of the Black dandy’s evolution over time via not just garments and accessories, but a range of media that includes drawings, paintings, photographs, and film excerpts. The first—Ownership—showcases an enslaved person’s livery from 19th century Maryland. Jook, which was one of Hurston’s original categories and was concerned with music, dancing and pleasure, includes a pair of Zoot suits from the 1940s; while Cosmopolitanism features pieces designed by both Pharrell Williams and the late Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton men’s.\n\n“The contemporary designers that are in the show are there because many of them talk about and use the history that we’re recounting as part of their design philosophies,” Miller pointed out. In some cases they also have heritage in West Africa or the Caribbean. “It’s been really interesting to see the show notes of Virgil Abloh and Grace Wales Bonner—they’re really well versed in the kinds of issues that we’re talking about in the exhibition, [issues] that are related to race and power, that are related to immigration, slavery, colonies and colonization, empowerment, joy, aesthetics.”\n\nBolton, for his part, believes menswear is in the midst of a renaissance. “That’s thanks not just to Black designers but also to men of style, like the male co-chairs for our Met Gala.” This year the co-chairs are Pharrell Williams, actor Colman Domingo, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton, musician A$AP Rocky, and Anna Wintour, with basketball star Lebron James acting as honorary co-chair. “They’re all men who aren’t afraid to take risks with their self-presentation. They take advantage of classic forms, but they also remix them and break them down in really new ways,” Bolton said. “I think Black men and Black designers are very much at the forefront of this new renaissance in menswear.”\n\nAs in previous years, the exhibition will gather a group of influential collaborators, each of whom are providing distinct elements: The interdisciplinary artist Torkwase Dyson will be responsible for the conceptual design of the exhibition; Tanda Francis, who creates monumental African heads and masks seen in both public and personal spaces, is creating bespoke mannequin heads that will be produced for the show; and the artist Tyler Mitchell will be photographing the catalogue.",

    "content": "The no-makeup look reigns supreme among celebrities who ooze a breezy, naturally luminous appeal. Think Gwyneth Paltrow doing an AMA at Goop HQ, bathed in an office-appropriate glow, or Pamela Anderson beaming and makeup-free at any number of recent events. The best tinted sunscreens play into the carefree vibe, flooding the skin with antioxidants, protecting it from the sun, and providing just a hint of coverage.\n\nAs Amy Wall, a pro esthetician in Northern California, notes, “Tinted sunscreens won't give you glam, but they will give you healthy coverage and peace of mind.” Since that’s just what the doctor ordered for the minimalist moment, it’s no wonder that the tinted SPF category is on fire (albeit burn-resistant!) right now.\n\nIn the past few months alone, La Roche-Posay has diversified its tinted sunscreen shade selection, while Beauty of Joseon has dropped a new line of ultra-lightweight SPF in 12 flexible shades. Last year, Supergoop! proved that an SPF 50 formula can feel weightless and dewy with the launch of Protec(tint), and RMS Beauty expanded its sun-care collection with 13 glow-boosting shades of niacinamide-infused sunscreen. The new class of tinted sunscreens are “inclusive, breathable, and adaptive,” Wall says—and many of them offer skincare benefits beyond UV protection, like hyaluronic acid for hydration and licorice root extract to brighten (to name a few).\n\nVogue’s Favorite Tinted Sunscreens\n\nWith no shortage of options on the market—including cult classics that have never lost their luster—we’ve whittled down the list with some help from the pros.

    "content": "Lewis Hamilton may be best known for his impressive race car driving—he is a seven-time winner of the Formula One World Drivers’ Championship, after all—but fashion fans know that in addition, Hamilton is no stranger to a strong red carpet look. Over the years, he has navigated events such as the Met Gala and British Fashion Awards with aplomb, choosing inventive looks that stray from the pack. It’s only natural, then, that Lewis was chosen as one of the 2025 Met Gala co-hosts—an announcement made just earlier this morning. In honor of the news, Vogue is taking a look back at some of Hamilton’s most memorable red carpet looks over the years.\n\nHamilton emerged on the global stage in the 2010s, often spotted in the era’s skinny-fit suits and graphic, designer streetwear—from satin Louis Vuitton bomber jackets to printed Prada styles. Another one of his recurring wardrobe staples? Sleek leather racing jackets—an ode to his own masterful skills behind the wheel. In recent years, however, Hamilton has become a true fashion icon, upping his style game with forward-thinking, statement-making designs. Working with stylist Eric Mcneal, Hamilton has taken traditional suits and given them a modern twist. At the 2024 Met Gala, the star driver wore a custom Burberry look that paid homage to 18th-century Black gardener John Ystumllym and poet Alex Wharton, via embroidery and a branch-like necklace. At this year’s GQ Global Creativity Awards, Hamilton donned a glitzy pinstriped coat with strands of crystals. Whenever he hits up a function, there will always be an unexpected element—and that’s the making of a true red carpet star.\n\nBelow, more of Hamilton’s best fashion moments.",

    "content": "During the 2024 awards season, there was no reputable Best Dressed list that doesn’t include Colman Domingo. The actor racked up nominations for his role as the Civil Rights activist Bayard Rustin in Rustin, and dominated red carpets along the way. With his keen eye and fearless sense of style, it only makes sense that Domingo takes on a new role: co-chair of the 2025 Met Gala.\n\nWhat is most appreciated from Domingo, and his stylists Wayman and Micah, is the palpable effort that goes into every look, no matter the occasion. Outside of the marquee awards shows, many male actors are inclined to phone it in, sartorially speaking. But not Domingo. Arguably his best outfit to date, the actor wore an impeccably tailored mustard yellow suit and a textured gold coat from Valentino Haute Couture to the Critics Choice Awards. And even when he does opt for a traditional tuxedo, he makes it his own with unexpected accessorizing. Domingo isn’t afraid to experiment with jewelry, embellishing his suit jackets with brooches, and layering necklaces, rings and bracelets. His most touching piece is a pinky ring that belonged to Bayard Rustin himself.\n\n“True to Colman’s Sagittarius nature he really loves to play and have fun in every facet of his being so his style and sense of fashion fully thrives. We love putting him in tailored fits that highlight his stature, and we love using accessories to innovate and elevate his looks,” Wayman and Micah tell Vogue. Though, they admit, Domingo’s magnetic personality gives every look that extra je ne sais quoi: “To top if all off, Colman's energy, confidence, and charisma always take every red carpet moment to the next level.”\n\nA sensation in the Vogue Slack channels, Domingo has caused a similar stir on social media. “How do you expect me to wear a suit when Colman Domingo walks the earth?!” one person posted on X. “Colman Domingo you have to stop. You smoke too tough. Your swag too different. Your bitch too bad. They’ll kill you,” another wrote. We concur.",
