        "content": "Hundreds have been killed or injured in the strikes, Gaza officials said.\n\nIsrael hit Gaza with a series of \"extensive strikes\" overnight Tuesday, vowing to open the \"gates of hell\" because Hamas has not released the remaining hostages. At least 404 Palestinians were killed in the strikes, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz said the Israel Defense Forces are targeting Hamas terrorists throughout the region.\n\n\"Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe IDF announced a second wave of airstrikes took place in the early afternoon local time. Among the targets attacked were terrorist cells, launch sites, weapons and additional military infrastructure used by the terrorist organizations to plan and carry out terrorist acts, and which posed a threat to IDF forces and Israeli citizens, according to the IDF.\n\nA Palestinian man is comforted as he weeps next to a truck carrying the bodies of the victims of Israeli overnight airstrikes before transporting them from the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza for burial, Mar. 18, 2025.

The IDF's Arabic spokesperson issued a broad evacuation order covering the entire perimeter of Gaza. Residents were warned to \"evacuate immediately to the known shelters in western Gaza City and those in Khan Younis.\"\n\nOf the Palestinians killed overnight, 174 were children and 89 were women, according to the ministry. The human toll in Gaza had risen steadily throughout the morning, the ministry said in a series of updates. At least 562 others were injured, the ministry said.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said it has received dozens of killed and injured at sites across Gaza.\n\nPalestinians carry a body pulled from the rubble of the Qrayqea family house, destroyed in Israeli strikes at dawn in the Shujaiya district in eastern Gaza City, Mar. 18, 2025.

We are appalled and outraged by these new unacceptable massacres of civilians,\" said Claire Nicolet, Doctors Without Borders's head of emergencies.\n\n\"Tonight we returned to fighting in Gaza due to Hamas' refusal to release the hostages and threats to harm IDF soldiers and Israeli communities,\" Katz said in a statement.\n\n\"If Hamas does not release all the hostages, the gates of hell will open in Gaza,\" he added.\n\nAn Israeli official told ABC News the preemptive offensive will continue \"as long as necessary,\" and will \"expand beyond air strikes.\"\n\nSmoke billows behind a cemetery (foreground) during Israeli strikes west of Gaza City on March 18, 2025. Omar Al-qattaa/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the \"resumption of aggression against the Gaza Strip and their direct shelling of civilian areas, with no regard for international humanitarian law.\"\n\nThe Egyptian Foreign Ministry also issued a statement saying it \"strongly condemns\" the Israeli airstrikes of Gaza, which constitute a \"blatant violation\" of the ceasefire and represents a \"dangerous escalation. That threatens to have severe consequences for the stability of the region.\"\n\nThe strikes targeted Hamas' mid-ranking military commanders, leadership officials and infrastructure, the official said.\n\n\"⁠The IDF is prepared and spread out in all arenas, both in personnel manning the borders and the Aerial Defence Array,\" the official added.\n\nFire burns in damaged houses, amid a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, as seen from the Israeli side of the border, Feb. 24, 2025. Amir Cohen/Reuters\n\nNetanyahu and Katz said the changes to the IDF's defensive guidelines come after Hamas \"rejected all offers\" on a conclusive hostage deal with Steve Witkoff, the U.S.'s special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nHamas said in a statement Tuesday that overturning the ceasefire agreement and the series of strikes put \"the prisoners in Gaza at an unknown fate.\"\n\nAn Israeli army Merkava main battle tank moves at a position in southern Israel along the border fence with the northern Gaza Strip on March 18, 2025.

        "content": "Trump says talks with Putin on Ukraine ceasefire have 'very good chance' of success\n\nPresident Donald Trump will hold a high-stakes call with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Tuesday as he tries to win his approval of a 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine.\n\n\"It's a bad situation in Russia, and it's a bad situation in Ukraine,\" Trump said on Monday. \"What's happening in Ukraine is not good, but we're going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace, and I think we'll be able to do it.\"\n\nThat positive assessment follows his prediction Sunday night that \"we'll see if we have something to announce -- maybe by Tuesday,\" saying \"a lot of work\" had been done over the weekend. \"Maybe we can. Maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance.\"\n\nThe Kremlin on Tuesday said it expects the call within a two-hour window beginning at about 9 a.m. ET. The encounter would be the first known call between Trump and Putin since peace talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials a week ago in Saudi Arabia yielded Kyiv agreeing to an immediate, temporary stop to hostilities should Russia do the same.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Mar. 13, 2025 and Russia's President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, Mar. 13, 2025. AFP via Getty Images\n\nSince then, Putin has been noncommittal on the proposal while fighting intensifies in Kursk.\n\nPutin said he was \"for\" a ceasefire but raised concerns and set out his own conditions, such as certain security guarantees. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, has accused the Russian leader of obstructing peace and \"prolonging\" the war.\n\nTrump on Monday said the only reason he was involved in negotiations is \"for humanity.\"\n\n\"A lot of people are being killed over there. And, we had to get Ukraine to do the right thing. It was not an easy situation. You got to see a little glimpse at the Oval Office, but I think they're doing the right thing right now. And we're trying to get a peace agreement done. We want to get a ceasefire and then a peace agreement,\" he said.\n\nUkraine's Zelenskyy will monitor the conversation between Trump and Putin with caution and great interest, a Ukrainian official informed about the matter told ABC News.\n\n\"We agreed to the U.S. ceasefire proposal with zero conditions, and if Putin is gonna start playing with Trump setting demands -- it will not work,\" the source added.\n\nA key question moving forward is how far Trump will go in pressuring Russia to agree to a ceasefire and ultimately bring an end to the three-year conflict, which began when Putin's forces invaded its sovereign neighbor.\n\nThe Trump administration took drastic steps in stopping military aid and pausing some intelligence sharing with Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Trump and Zelenskyy. Those two tools resumed after Ukraine agreed to the ceasefire last Tuesday.\n\nPlus, U.S. officials have said it would be unrealistic for Ukraine to return to its prewar borders and expressly ruled out its bid for NATO membership.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has not publicly made similar demands of Putin.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Mar. 18, 2025 and President Donald Trump in Washington, Mar. 13, 2025. Reuters\n\nTrump on Sunday said land and power plants were on the table for Tuesday's discussion, as well as \"dividing up certain assets\" between the two countries.\n\n\"Well, I think we'll be talking about land. It's a lot of land. It's a lot different than it was before the wars, you know. And we'll be talking about land, we'll be talking about power plants. That's a big question, but I think we have a lot of it already discussed, very much by both sides,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.\n\nTrump last week said his administration could ramp up pressure on Russia but hoped it wouldn't be \"necessary.\"\n\n\"There are things you could do that wouldn't be pleasant in a financial sense,\" he said. \"I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia. I don't want to do that because I want to get peace.\"\n\nABC News' Oleksiy Pshemyskiy and Michelle Stoddart contributed to this report.",

With Democrats' help, the Senate passed the stopgap bill hours before funding was set to lapse.\n\nMany Democrats, including progressives, had wanted him to vote against the bill and to more strongly protest against President Donald Trump's and congressional Republicans' agendas.\n\nSchumer had events planned in Baltimore, New York City and Washington, D.C., this week. Protests were planned outside of all three events.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer's book tour told ABC News that \"due to security concerns, Senator Schumer's book events are being rescheduled.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer gives a television interview, at the Capitol in Washington, March 14, 2025. Ben Curtis/AP\n\nSome of the hosts of Schumer's events, including D.C. bookstore Politics and Prose and Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library, also individually cited security concerns for the cancellation.\n\nSchumer has been facing steep criticism from his own party for voting for the funding bill.\n\nAfter announcing that he would be a no vote on the proposed spending plan -- a decision that could have led to a government shutdown -- Schumer later said from the floor he would vote yes.\n\nThe switch-up earned him the praise of Trump, but the ire of prominent Democrats, and comes as the party struggles to mount a cohesive response to actions by the Trump administration that are reshaping the federal government, immigration policy and other key issues.\n\nSchumer, defending his decision to vote for the funding bill, said in a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday that while he did not approve of what was included in a funding bill, a government shutdown would be worse.\n\nThe Senate Minority Leader said that a shutdown would give Trump and Elon Musk, who has overseen major cuts to the federal government, more power to make decisions about what to cut, and that the shutdown would cause pain to American families.\n\nElon Musk step off Air Force One upon his return to Washington at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Mar. 17, 2025.

It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda,\" Schumer said.\n\nIn a CNN appearance on Friday, Schumer framed the decision as a way to protect the Democratic Party, while downplaying intraparty disagreement over the path he took.\n\n\"My job as leader is to lead the party,\" Schumer said. \"And if there's going to be danger in the near future, to protect the party. And I'm proud I did it. I knew I did the right thing, and I knew there would be some disagreements. That's how it always is.\"\n\nSchumer also denied any insinuation he didn't have the \"overwhelming support\" of his caucus, suggesting members had thanked him for his position.\n\nSchumer is set to appear on ABC's \"The View\" on Tuesday, March 18.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington, Mar. 16, 2025. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nAmong the groups that had been organizing protests of Schumer's book tour events was the Progressive Change Campaign Committee PAC (PCCC), which wrote in an email on Sunday, \"We need to make an example of Schumer and send a message to all Democratic officials that we want BACKBONE.\"\n\n\"Now is the time to channel public anger, not hide from it,\" PCCC co-founder Adam Green told ABC News on Monday after the events were postponed. \"People are serious about Democrats not having a plan to fight Trump.\"\n\nAnother major Democratic-aligned group, the Indivisible Project, called on Schumer to step aside as leader of the Senate Democrats in a statement on Saturday. Indivisible had also been planning on protesting outside of the Baltimore event.\n\nSchumer \"led the charge to wave the white flag of surrender,\" Indivisible co-executive director Ezra Levin wrote in the statement.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on March 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nLevin praised Schumer for his work in the Senate, but said that his actions had failed both the United States and the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Senator Schumer has contributed to and led many important accomplishments that Indivisible is grateful for. But with our democracy on the line, he let us, the country, and the Democratic Party down… Senator Schumer should step aside as leader. Every Democrat in the Senate should call for him to do so, and begin making plans for new leadership immediately,\" Levin wrote.\n\nThe controversy also comes as recent polling shows Americans feeling disillusioned toward the Democratic Party. An NBC News poll published on Sunday (but taken before the government funding vote) found that only 27% of registered voters feel favorable about the party.\n\nABC News' Averi Harper, Isabella Murray and Karen Travers contributed to this report.",

Bob Menendez, according to federal prosecutors, who alleged those introductions helped establish a corrupt agreement in which they accepted bribes in exchange for her husband's actions to benefit Egypt.\n\nOn the eve of jury selection, the former senator posted on X that his wife is being \"forced by the government to go to trial tomorrow\" despite having recent reconstructive surgery for breast cancer.\n\n\"Only the arrogance of the SDNY can be so cruel and inhumane,\" Bob Menendez said in the X post, which tagged President Donald Trump.\n\nFormer Sen.

Her trial has been postponed several times while she underwent treatment.\n\nShe is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nShe has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nIn January, Bob Menendez was sentenced to 11 years in prison after being convicted on all 16 counts last year in his federal corruption trial, becoming the first sitting member of Congress to be convicted of acting as a foreign agent.\n\nFollowing his sentencing, Bob Menendez called the prosecution a \"political witch hunt\" and that he hopes Trump \"cleans up the cesspool and restores the integrity to the system.\"\n\nIn issuing the sentence, Judge Sidney Stein said the former senator will not have to report to prison until June 6 so that he can be available when his wife goes on trial.",

As wombats are so often hit on Australian roads, I stopped to ensure they got off the road safely and didn't get hit,\" Jones began in an Instagram post shared Friday, which has since been deleted. \"However, as is seen from the video when I walked up to them, the joey did not move or run off. I was concerned it may have been sick or injured, and made a snap judgement to pick up the joey and see if this was the case.\"\n\nJones' video of herself with the baby wombat has since been deleted from her Instagram. In the clip, Jones could be seen running across a street toward a car while holding the screeching baby wombat, as the wombat's mother chased after her.\n\n\"I ran, not to rip the joey away from its mother, but from fear she might attack me,\" Jones wrote in her statement. \"The snap judgement I made in these moments was never from a place of harm or stealing a joey.\"\n\nThe end of Jones' since-deleted video doesn't show whether the baby wombat and its mother were reunited. In her statement, Jones said she did reunite the pair.\n\nSam Jones, a hunting influencer, shared a now-deleted video on Instagram of her holding a baby wombat and taking it away from its mother in Australia. @samstrays_somewhere/Instagram\n\n\"While I was unbelievably excited to see such an amazing animal, I looked it over quickly and immediately returned it to its mother,\" said Jones. \"I ensured that the mother and joey did reunite, went off together, and that they got off the road.\"\n\n\"I've done a great deal of reflection on the situation and have realized that I did not handle this situation as best as I should have,\" she continued, later adding in apology, \"I have learned from the situation and I'm truly sorry for the distress I've caused.\"\n\nJones' video post triggered backlash and outrage, with some Australians calling for Jones to be deported. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also weighed in multiple times in public comments.\n\n\"It's a shocker. You know, a wombat is a slow moving, peaceful animal, and to take a baby wombat from this mum was distressing, quite clearly,\" Albanese said in a March 14 radio interview. \"And I found it really distressing the video that was there. I don't know what the hell this woman thought she was doing. You know, there's a lot of, a lot wilder animals in Australia she could have got into trouble with if she'd picked up their babies. But to pick up a baby wombat, it is not on.\"\n\nIn a separate Instagram statement Friday, Jones responded to people calling her a \"villain,\" claiming that \"things … are not as they seem.\"\n\n\"Over holding a wombat, thousands threaten my life,\" she wrote. \"Let me be clear; these same people ought to understand the reality of Australia today. For the readers that are so angered by my mistaken attempt to help and that I am a hunter -- do not be blind to your country.\"\n\nJones stated that under Australian law, wombats and kangaroos can sometimes be legally slaughtered for various reasons.\n\n\"While the prime minister wishes harm on me for picking up a wombat, I implore you to take a good, hard, look at what is currently being done in Australia surrounding the real issue it faces, the lack of power for tens of thousands of Aussies, and the treatment of its native wildlife,\" said Jones. \"Then, decide for yourself, if I, a person who certainly makes mistakes, am really your villain.\"\n\nWildlife experts say taking a baby animal from its mother or from its home can be distressing for the animal.\n\nA spokesperson for the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water told ABC News previously the department was aware of allegations in Jones' case and an inquiry was ongoing but they would not comment further.\n\nThe department also said under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, a person may commit an offense if they take or move a member of a listed threatened species, such as a northern hairy-nosed wombat, from, in, or on Australia without approval.\n\nABC News has reached out to Jones for comment.",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Mar. 17, 2025.\n\nLONDON -- Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are expected to speak on Tuesday as the White House continues its campaign for a ceasefire and eventual peace deal to end Russia's devastating war on Ukraine.\n\n\"It's a bad situation in Russia, and it's a bad situation in Ukraine,\" Trump said on Monday. \"What's happening in Ukraine is not good, but we're going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace, and I think we'll be able to do it.\"\n\nSince Trump's return to the White House in January, his new administration has sought to bring an end to Russia's war by berating and pressuring Kyiv. Trump has repeatedly said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zeleneskyy \"does not have the cards\" to come out on top of the negotiations.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has been offered normalization and hinting at territorial gains and sanctions relief.\n\nThis photograph shows traditional Russian wooden nesting doll depicting Russia's President Vladimir Putin (R) and President Donald Trump in Moscow's Red Square, Russia, on Feb. 28, 2025.

Oleg Petrasiuk/AP\n\nThis month, the administration said Russians were among 43 nationalities being considered for travel bans. It also allowed to lapse a sanctions exemption allowing Russian banks to use U.S. payment systems for energy transactions.\n\nTrump may seek to further tighten the screws on Russia's economy, in which inflation is rising and dollars are increasingly difficult and expensive to access.\n\n\"What the U.S. can do is put even more pressure on the Russian financing sector, increasing the sanctions against banks that that basically also have a stake in the oil and gas sector in order to compromise the financial sustainability of the Russian Federation and make it basically unsustainable for Russia to continue the war,\" Federico Borsari of the Center for European Policy Analysis think tank told ABC News.\n\nThe U.S. may also seek further action to identify and penalize vessels in Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet,\" by which Moscow has been able to continue exporting its fossil fuels and avoid sanctions, Borsari added.\n\nStill, Russia has shown an ability to adapt to and skirt sanctions, even if the measures have undermined the national economy. The impact of new sanctions may not be immediate enough to force Putin to the negotiating table, Ignatov said.\n\nSeeking to further curtail Russia's energy exports or expanding secondary sanctions -- meaning measures against those still doing business with sanctioned entities -- may also bring the U.S. into conflict with key Russian customers like China and India.\n\n\"There is no magic bullet in terms of sanctions,\" Ignatov said.\n\nPutin's hand\n\nTrump has praised Putin's supposed readiness for peace, instead framing Ukraine and Zelenskyy as the main impediments to a deal. Still, Moscow has shown no sign of downgrading its war goals, which still include the annexation of swaths of its neighbor, the \"demilitarization\" of Ukraine and its permanent exclusion from NATO.\n\nPutin was non-committal to last week's U.S.-Ukraine proposal of a 30-day ceasefire. Moscow is \"for\" the pause, the president said, but framed any pause as a military benefit for Kyiv and said several difficult conditions would need to be fulfilled before the Kremlin would give its full support.\n\nRussia \"needs\" a pause in the fighting to reform its own shattered military, Pavel Luzin -- a Russian political analyst at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy -- told ABC News. \"But at the same time, Russia does not have desirable conditions on the battlefield.\"\n\nRussia's President Vladimir Putin visits a command centre of the Russian armed forces in the course of Russia-Ukraine conflict in the Kursk region, Russia, Mar. 12, 2025 Reuters TV via Reuters\n\n\"What Russia has been trying to do since the fall of 2022 is defeat a big group of Ukrainian forces as a pre-condition for negotiations about a break,\" he added. \"Russia wanted to demoralize the Ukrainian leadership and society. After two-and-a-half years, Russia was not successful.\"\n\nIgnatov said Moscow's recent engagement with the Trump administration does suggest an appetite for some kind of deal.\n\n\"I think both Russia and the U.S. are looking at this negotiation seriously,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean that both sides are thinking about any good deal for Ukraine, but I think that both sides want to finish this conflict.\"\n\nThe Russians, he added, \"want to avoid a direct confrontation with Trump, because they really value this process of normalization. I think what they tried to do is to decouple Ukraine from the normalization of the other issues. Even if they don't succeed on Ukraine, they want to continue to work on other issues.\"\n\nStill, Moscow is \"not ready to sacrifice their interests\" in Ukraine, Ignatov continued. \"They are not ready to make very big concessions -- serious concessions, to leave territories or something like this.\"\n\nOpportunity, crisis for Ukraine\n\nTrump's radical pivot away from Ukraine in the opening months of his second term left Kyiv and its other foreign partners reeling. Though the pause to U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing was brief, it rattled leaders and commanders in Kyiv.\n\n\"We consider this turbulence to be part of negotiations, which I think was quite often used by Trump in his past when he was in business,\" Yehor Cherniev -- a member of the Ukrainian Parliament and the chairman of his country's delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly -- told ABC News. \"So, we understand.\"\n\nTrump's inherent unpredictability has given Ukrainians hope that his interactions with Putin may not necessarily play in Russia's favor.\n\n\"Trump should say directly: 'Vladimir, if you don't agree unconditionally to my proposal then I'll have to make a deal with a new leader of Russia instead of you,'\" Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee, told ABC News. \"If he tried it with Zelenskyy, then why not with Putin?\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Mar. 13, 2025 and Russia's President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, Mar. 13, 2025. AFP via Getty Images\n\nA threat to expand American military aid to Ukraine could give such coercion bite, analysts and Ukrainian lawmakers who spoke with ABC News said.\n\nLifting restrictions on U.S. weapon use inside Russia, requesting more military aid funding from Congress, replenishing supplies of long-range ATACMS missiles and delivering new long-range strike weapons like the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile could all underscore the U.S. demand for Russia to negotiate.\n\nBut such steps would run counter to Trump's repeated statements that the war must end as soon as possible -- with or without American involvement.\n\n\"I'm not sure if he has any desire to escalate the war, because he's the 'peace president,'\" Ignatov said, noting that any request for more funding from Congress could also touch off unwelcome domestic political disputes.\n\n\"He's said that if we are not able to succeed, the U.S. will be out of the war,\" Ignatov added. \"So, it means that he is not going to escalate.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen if Trump's ambition for a deal will be enough to overcome the decades-long complexity of Russia's aggression against its \"brotherly nation,\" as Putin was still describing Ukraine months into the 2022 full-scale invasion.\n\n\"The Russians have quite clearly showed already that they are not ready,\" Cherniev said. \"Now there are not so many options for Trump's administration.\"\n\n\"Trump wants to be a peacemaker,\" he added. \"If he just leaves these negotiations, that will mean that Putin wins. And I doubt that Trump will allow Putin to win.\"\n\nTrump's turn against Ukraine begun to erode the trust built up by decades of American backing. But for now, at least, some hope remains.\n\nThe president \"might\" ultimately side with Moscow, Merezhko said. \"But that goes against American values -- Americans and public opinion in the U.S. have always been on the side of the underdogs.\"",

Following the order, the head of VOA said all of its 1,300 journalists and staff had been put on administrative leave.\n\nTrump’s executive order also terminated grants for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia, which broadcast news to Eastern Europe, Russia, China and North Korea and Central Asia.\n\nThe order threatens to close down media organizations that for decades have provided independent news coverage and promoted journalism to hundreds of millions of people worldwide and provided an information lifeline to people living in countries under authoritarian regimes, advocates say.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the media during a guided tour of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts before leading a board meeting, Mar. 17, 2025 in Washington. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists, a prominent press freedom organization, called the move a “reward to dictators and despots” and urged Congress to act to preserve the media outlets.\n\nVOA and the other media organizations were founded during World War II to promote democracy and provide uncensored information. But even after the end of the Cold War, in many authoritarian and poor countries, they have continued to play a powerful role as independent news providers, sometimes as the only open media where all others are censored or severely under-resourced, such as Iran, Russia, Belarus, Afghanistan and North Korea.\n\nVOA and its affiliates reach 420 million people in 63 languages and more than 100 countries each week, according to the U.S. Agency for Global Media. VOA and RFE/RL’s reporting has been routinely deemed a threat by authoritarian regimes, which have sought to pressure them, including by jailing their journalists.\n\nTen journalists and contributors of the VOA, RFE, and RFA are currently either imprisoned or missing in different countries across the world, according to the USAGM website.\n\nIn Russia and much of the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine, RFE/RL reporters have played an outsized role in covering political repression and sometimes breaking major corruption investigations. They employ hundreds of local journalists, reporting in both English and the local language.\n\nVOA's Persian department broadcasts television news programs in Iran and operates a news website. RFE/RL's Persian Service, Radio Farda, also produces news and analysis in audio and video formats and runs a news website.\n\n“Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iranian journalists have faced intense suppression, censorship, imprisonment, and even execution at the hands of the Islamic Republic of Iran leaving Iranian people with almost no access to free media platforms inside the country,\" a UK-based Iranian journalist told ABC News.\n\n“Shutting down outlets like VOA Persian, Radio Liberty, and Radio Farda would deal a major blow to press freedom and the free flow of information in Iran, directly serving the interests of the Islamic Republic,” the journalist, who asked not to be named for security reasons, added.\n\nIn a statement published on his LinkedIn Sunday, Michael Abramowitz, Voice of America's director, said, “For the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced.”\n\n“VOA promotes freedom and democracy around the world by telling America’s story and by providing objective and balanced news and information, especially for those living under tyranny,” he added.\n\nSignage for US broadcaster Voice of America is seen in Washington, D.C, March 16, 2025. Bonnie Cash/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut Trump and his allies have attacked VOA as corrupt and promoting values alien to the United States. Trump, in his first term, accused the organizations of speaking for “America’s adversaries – not its citizens”.\n\nThe White House in a statement Saturday said the order “will ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda.”\n\nThe Trump administration has also framed the gutting of VOA as part of the drastic effort to cut down the federal budget being led by Elon Musk. Musk last month wrote the USGM outlets are “just radical crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1bn/year of US taxpayer money.”\n\nKari Lake, failed Senate candidate for Arizona, who Trump had tapped to oversee VOA and had promised to overhaul it, on Saturday wrote the agency was “a giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer,” calling it “unsalvageable.\"\n\nEuropean leaders on Monday expressed dismay at the cutting of funds to RFE/RL, with some suggesting they were exploring ways to partially fill the gap.\n\nThe Czech Republic's foreign minister, Jan Lipavsky, said RFE/RL, which is based in Prague, \"is one of the few credible sources in dictatorships like Iran, Belarus, and Afghanistan.\"\n\nHe said he would raise the issue with his fellow European Union foreign ministers on Tuesday about how to help the outlet to keep at least partially broadcasting.\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski confirmed that the EU is considering options to help RFE/RL, according to the Kyiv Independent.\n\n\"We are at the stage of brainstorming, but clearly, these are worthy institutions whose mission should continue,\" Sikorski told the website.",

Last month, DNC Chair Ken Martin was in Wisconsin canvassing for the Wisconsin Democratic coordinated campaign.\n\nThe April 1 election will decide who will take the open seat on the court and whether the bench will remain under control by the liberal justices or flip to a conservative majority, with major cases involving abortion, redistricting, and election laws being brought up.\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court candidates Brad Schimel and Susan Crawford participate in a debate, March 12, 2025, in Milwaukee.

Trump won the state by just under 30,000 voters in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court race is also seen as one indication of Elon Musk's influence beyond Washington and how Democrats try to push back against the richest man in the world, linking him to Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate.\n\n\"With Wisconsin voters up against the world's richest man, this is an all-hands-on-deck moment and we're thrilled to have the support of the DNC in this fight,\" said Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. “Elections in Wisconsin often come down to a hairsbreadth, and every voter we can turn out to support Judge Susan Crawford and Dr. Jill Underly on April 1 can make the difference between keeping Wisconsin on a path of progress or letting Elon Musk and Donald Trump drag us backwards.”\n\nA conservative group linked to Musk, Building America's Future, has spent more than $1.6 million on television ads in the race, while another, Musk's super PAC America PAC, has spent over $6 million on get-out-the-vote efforts and digital media, according to state campaign finance records.\n\nElon Musk arrives for US President Donald Trump's address to a joint session of Congress in the House Chamber of the Capitol in Washington, Mar. 4, 2025.

JB Pritzker.\n\nAlthough Trump has not endorsed Schimel, Musk urged on X last month for people to \"vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!\"\n\nThe DNC is also working to support the Wisconsin Democratic coordinated campaign, with the state party recently announcing their \"People vs. Musk\" campaign to push back against Musk's influence in the race.\n\nThe state’s Supreme Court race is the most expensive judicial race in US history, according to The Brennan Center, a nonprofit public policy institute.\n\nAs of Monday, more than $59 million has been spent in the race, which the think tank says breaks the record for the most spending in a state supreme court election, surpassing the estimated $56 million poured into the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\n\nABC News' Oren Oppenheim contributed to this report.",

After claiming asylum and being detained for a few days, ICE released them and ordered them to check in routinely with the federal agency.\n\nSanchez said the couple had gone to several of their scheduled check-ins without experiencing any issues. But on Feb. 3, Tiapa was not allowed to return home with his wife despite being scheduled to have his first court appearance in his asylum case in March.\n\nSanchez provided ABC News with documents that confirmed Tiapa's scheduled appointment with an immigration judge on March 19.\n\n\"He went to his routine ICE appointment and he didn't come out,\" Sanchez told ABC News.\n\nShe said she was able to complete her check-in with ICE that day and has not yet received an appointment for another check-in.\n\nYvonna Sanchez and her husband Jose Franco Caraballo Tiapa are seen in this undated photo. Yvonna Sanchez\n\nSimilarly, ABC News spoke with Sebastian Garcia Casique, who claims his brother was detained by ICE after his routine-check-in.\n\nAccording to Casique, his brother Francisco Garcia Casique. who entered the United States in December 2023 and surrendered to authorities, was detained after going to an ICE office last month for his appointment.\n\n\"There, some police officers detained him because they saw his tattoos and said they were going to investigate him because of them,\" Casique told ABC News.\n\nCasique said that on Friday, his brother called his family from the detention center in Texas where he was being held to let them know that he believed he was being deported to Venezuela. But on Sunday, Casique said that he and his family recognized his brother in a photo posted on social media by the White House.\n\n\"It's a nightmare,\" Casique told ABC News.\n\nSanchez said that after being detained in Dallas, her husband was transferred to a detention center in Laredo, Texas, where she was able to speak with him regularly.\n\nBut on Saturday, she said her husband told her that he believed he was going to be transferred and possibly deported.\n\nOn Sunday morning, after Sanchez saw the video posted on X by the president of El Salvador showing Venezuelan migrants being sent there, she checked the ICE locator website that shares updated information about where migrants are being detained.\n\n\"I check the system, and he doesn't show up,\" Sanchez told ABC News. \"I constantly think and know he's there because he has tattoos, because he's a barber, but he has no involvement with the group they're associating him with.\"\n\nSanchez said that her husband is being unfairly targeted by the Trump administration for being Venezuelan and having tattoos, after Trump on Saturday said he was invoking the 18th century Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nShe provided ABC News with documents that show Tiapa does not have any criminal records in Venezuela.\n\nFrancisco Garcia Casique is seen in this undated photo. Sebastian Garcia Casique\n\nCasique also told ABC News his brother has not committed any crimes beyond crossing the U.S. border.\n\nCasique claims that after his brother surrendered to authorities, he was detained and investigated for a few days, then appeared before an immigration judge who ordered him to be released with an ankle monitor to be tracked.\n\nCasique said his brother turned 24 while being detained\n\n“Never in his life had he spent a birthday in that situation,\" he said. \"The depression must be getting to him.”\n\nCasique said his brother had the American Dream of working as a barber in the U.S.\n\n“[He] was hoping for a better future to help us, help all the family members, and look at the situation now,” Casique said.\n\nA review of federal court records found no criminal court cases associated with Garcia Casique or Tiapa.\n\nABC News previously reported that advocacy groups and relatives of some of the Venezuelan migrants who were recently sent to the prison in Guantanamo Bay claim the administration provided no evidence the migrants were \"high-threat\" criminals or that they belonged to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe Trump administration, over the weekend, announced that would begin deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century law that allows for the arrest and removal of non-U.S. citizens when their nation or government is at war with the United States. The Trump administration designated the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, calling it a \"hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States.\"\n\nAfter the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act was challenged in court on Saturday, a federal judge verbally ordered two planes carrying alleged gang members to El Salvador to turn around and return to the U.S., but sources said administration officials made the determination that since the flights were already over international waters, the judge's order did not apply, and the planes were not turned around.\n\nAlleged members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua who were deported by the U.S. government, are detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador in a photo obtained Mar. 16, 2025.

(Brian Lawless/PA via AP, File)\n\nLONDON -- John “Paddy” Hemingway, the last surviving pilot who flew during the Battle of Britain, has died at the age of 105.\n\nHe died Monday at his home in Dublin, the Royal Air Force said.\n\nHemingway was just 20 years old when he and his comrades in the Royal Air Force took to the skies to fight off wave after wave of Nazi aircraft that sought to pound Britain into submission during the the summer and autumn of 1940.\n\nDuring dogfights with German aircraft in August of 1940, Hemingway was twice forced to bail out of his Hurricane fighter, once landing in sea off the east coast of England, before returning to his squadron to resume the fight, the RAF said. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for gallantry in 1941.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2020, Hemingway dismissed suggestions of bravery and heroism, saying he was a pilot and had a job to do.\n\n“The world was at war, and you couldn’t go somewhere and say, ‘I’m at peace and I don’t fight wars,’” he said.\n\n“The main skill was luck. You had to be lucky, no matter how good you were. For instance, my boss, Dickie Lee, was the best pilot I’ve every seen, but he was shot down and killed. So he had no luck. I had bags of luck.”",

(AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko, File)\n\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa -- A member of a South African research team that is confined for more than a year at an isolated Antarctica base was put under psychological evaluation there after he allegedly assaulted and sexually harassed colleagues, government officials said.\n\nThe problems at the SANAE IV base were first reported by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, which said it had seen an email from a team member to authorities last month claiming the man had attacked the base leader and made threats.\n\nThe email pleaded for help.\n\n“His behavior has escalated to a point that is deeply disturbing,” the email said, according to The Sunday Times. “I remain deeply concerned about my own safety, constantly wondering if I might become the next victim.” The report said the man allegedly made a death threat.\n\nSouth Africa’s Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely “to mediate and restore relationships at the base.” They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.\n\n“The alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,” the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.\n\nThe nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.\n\nThe base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.\n\nThe next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.\n\nAuthorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.\n\nThe ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the “extreme nature of the environment in Antarctica” and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.\n\n“It is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,” it said.\n\nPrevious problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.\n\nIn 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.\n\nThe National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they’d experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.\n\n___\n\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

Possible reasons: The page may have been moved, it no longer exists, or the address may have been typed incorrectly,\" the website states, as of Monday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately reply to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, the HHS said that the department \"and the Office of the Surgeon General are complying with President Trump's Executive Order on Protecting Second Amendment Rights.\"\n\nLast month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order, directing the Attorney General to review \"[a]ll Presidential and agencies' actions from January 2021 through January 2025 that purport to promote safety but may have impinged on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.\"\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously stated he believes in the Second Amendment but that he wants to determine the cause of mass shootings.\n\nIn a 2023 live stream on X with Elon Musk, Kennedy falsely claimed there is \"tremendous circumstantial evidence\" that people using antidepressants were more likely to commit school shootings. Experts previously told ABC News there is no evidence to suggest that patients with mental health disorders, or those who are on medications for disorders, are more likely to be violent.\n\nFirearm-related injuries are the leading cause of death in the U.S. among kids and teens. Gun-related suicides have risen among all age groups from 2012 to 2022; the greatest rise has been among 10–14-year-olds, according to Murhty's advisory.\n\nGun violence prevention programs, such as GIFFORDS -- which was founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- criticized the Trump administration for the removal of the advisory.\n\n\"By removing this important public health advisory with lifesaving resources, President Trump has chosen to prioritize gun industry profits over protecting kids and families,\" Emma Brown, executive director of GIFFORDS, said in a statement. \"Guns have been the number one killer of American children and adolescents since 2020, and non-partisan health care experts have understood gun violence as a public health crisis for years.\"\n\nABC News' Medical Unit's Dr. Jade Cobern contributed to this report.",

Once the transaction is closed, the company says Wiz will join Google Cloud.\n\n“Today, businesses and governments that run in the cloud are looking for even stronger security solutions, and greater choice in cloud computing providers,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement Tuesday — adding that Google Cloud and Wiz will “turbocharge improved cloud security and the ability to use multiple clouds” together.\n\nWiz, a four-year-old startup headquartered in New York, makes security tools designed to shield the information stored in remote data centers from intruders.\n\nGoogle has had its eyes on Wiz for some time. The purchase price announced Tuesday surpasses a reported $23 billion buyout proposal that Wiz rejected last July.",

Truman in the Red Sea before airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, on March 15, 2025.\n\nLONDON -- President Donald Trump on Monday said that further attacks or retaliation by the Houthis would be considered an attack by Iran and it would face “dire” consequences.\n\nTrump’s threat comes after the United States launched a new series of airstrikes against the Yemeni group beginning Saturday. The Houthis on Sunday claimed to have thwarted “a hostile attack the enemy was preparing to launch against our country.” A U.S. official told ABC News that the Houthis fired 11 drones and one ballistic missile at the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier group in the Red Sea on Saturday, none of which came close to hitting any U.S. vessels.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump called the Houthis \"sinister mobsters and thugs\" said their attacks \"emanate from, and are created by, IRAN.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump looks on as military strikes are launched against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, at an unspecified location in this handout image released March 15, 2025. White House via Reuters\n\nTrump said Iran is \"dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, 'Intelligence.'\"\n\n\"Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!\" Trump said.\n\nOn Sunday, the Houthis claimed to have fired 18 ballistic missiles and a drone in two separate attacks over the previous 24 hours. All drones were downed by fighters -- 10 shot down by Air Force planes and one by Navy planes -- while the ballistic missile was not intercepted as it fell far short of the vessels, the U.S. official said.\n\nTrump described the U.S. strikes as \"decisive and powerful military action\" against the Iranian-backed group. The Houthis have been targeting Western-linked shipping and launching munitions into Israel since the fall of 2022, in protest of Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft and drones,\" Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday. \"We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"\n\nLt. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, the head of operations at the Joint Staff, told reporters at Monday's Pentagon press briefing that the U.S. struck 30 targets at multiple locations on Saturday and there were additional strikes conducted on Sunday. He said the operation continued Monday \"and it will continue in the coming days until we achieve the President's objectives.”\n\nGrynkewich said targets included terrorist training sites, unmanned aerial vehicle infrastructure, weapons manufacturing capabilities and weapon storage facilities. They also included command and control centers, where \"several senior duty unmanned aerial vehicle experts were located on Sunday,\" as well as facilities that have been used to threaten shipping.\n\nThe Yemeni Health Ministry said the strikes killed 53 people and injured 98 more. Grynkewich there were “dozens of military fatalities” from Saturday’s strikes and that there are no indications of civilian casualties. He said the Pentagon was aware of reports of civilian casualties, and “we look at those closely when they do come in, but we have no credible indications.”\n\nSpeaking with reporters on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he was not concerned about retaliatory strikes related to the latest American strikes.\n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that the strikes represented \"an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.\"\n\nDetailing their latest attack on U.S. Navy vessels, the Houthis said in a Sunday statement that they will \"continue to ban the passage of Israeli ships through the zone of ​​operations until the blockade on the Gaza Strip is lifted.\"\n\nThe Houthis then released a statement late Monday, claiming \"the implementation of a qualitative military operation targeting the US aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman for the third time in the past 48 hours, as well as targeting a US destroyer, in response to the brutal US aggression against our country.\" The extent of their attacks or their relative success has not been confirmed.\n\nThis image taken from video provided by the U.S. Navy shows an aircraft launching from the USS Harry S.

Detectives are searching for the 15 and 11-year-olds.\n\nScott Dwight Habermehl, 63, was riding to his job at Sandia National Laboratory early in the morning in May when he was hit by a car after it swerved into the bike lane, according to police.\n\nThe crash was filmed from inside the car and circulated on social media. In the recording, a voice believed to be the 13-year-old can be heard saying he is about to hit the bicyclist, according to law enforcement. The car appears to accelerate and a voice believed to be the 15-year-old says, “Just bump him, brah.”\n\nThe driver asks, “Like bump him?”\n\nA passenger says, “Yeah, just bump him. Go like…15…20.”\n\nLoud sounds can then be heard in the recording, including “metal flexing,” according to law enforcement.\n\nThe video was posted on social media and reported to police. A middle school principal also reported the video to police after a student flagged it.\n\nThe Associated Press doesn’t typically name people under 18 accused of a crime.",

However, sources said top lawyers and officials in the administration made the determination that since the flights were over international waters, Boasberg's order did not apply, and the planes were not turned around.\n\nThe verbal instructions from Boasberg accompanied a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens currently in custody, which the judge issued less than two hours after Trump attempted to invoke the 18th century Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nDeputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli argued Monday during a \"fact-finding\" hearing convened by Judge Boasberg thay the judge's directive on Saturday evening to turn around the flights did not take effect until it was put in writing later that evening.\n\n\"You knew in the morning that there would be a hearing at 5 p.m., so any plane that you put into an air in or around that time you knew that I was having a hearing about,\" the judge responded. \"So when I said directly to turn those planes around, the idea that my written order was pithier, that this could be disregarded, that's a heck of a stretch.\"\n\nLawyers with the Department of Justice refused to provide any additional information about the Trump administration's recent deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, arguing disclosure of the information \"national security and diplomatic concerns.\"\n\nKambli insisted that the Trump administration had complied with the court's written order -- but provided no additional information to support the claim -- before offering seemingly conflicting defenses and arguing the breadth of Trump's authority as president made the removals lawful.\n\nAlleged members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua who were deported by the U.S. government, are detained at the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador in a photo obtained Mar. 16, 2025. El Salvador Presidential Press Office via AP\n\n\"Once that they are in international waters, the president has authority outside of the Alien Enemies Act, which would not have been subject to either order,\" Kambli said.\n\n\"My equitable powers are pretty clear that they do not lapse at the water's edge,\" Boasberg replied.\n\nKambli, however, repeatedly refused to provide more information to support his claims, insisting the information would risk national security.\n\n\"The information that I am authorized to provide is that no plane took off from the United States after the written order came through,\" Kambli said.\n\nJudge Boasberg -- who previously oversaw the United States Alien Terrorist Removal Court -- pushed back on the idea that the information could not be disclosed to the court.\n\n\"What's the basis for not disclosing it to me?\" he said.\n\n\"Your Honor, it is based on national security concerns with flight patterns and things of that sort,\" Kambli said.\n\nBoasberg ordered the DOJ to submit, by noon Tuesday, a sworn declaration of what they represented in a filing Monday -- that a third flight that took off after his written order on Saturday carried detainees who were removable on grounds other than the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nHe said he would hold another hearing on Friday, barring any stay on the proceedings from the appeals court.\n\nPrior to the hearing, DOJ attorneys argued in a Monday court filing that the court should vacate the hearing because they do not believe they violated the court's orders, and they are not prepared to provide any further operational security or national security details to the plaintiffs or to the public.\n\nJustice Department attorneys subsequently asked the circuit court to step in and stop the hearing and to assign the case to a different judge, but the hearing proceeded as planned.\n\nTop DOJ leadership wrote in a filing that \"an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction\" -- claiming the government not violate any order because the oral directive in court, issued at 6:46 p.m. ET Saturday, was not in the written order that was filed to the docket at 7:25 p.m. ET.\n\nIn a court filing late Sunday night, lawyers with the ACLU and Democracy Forward Foundation argued that the Trump administration may have committed a \"blatant violation\" of the court's directive by acting as if the order only applied to flights in U.S. airspace and individuals on American soil.\n\n\"This Court orally and unambiguously directed the government to turn around any planes carrying individuals being removed pursuant to the AEA Proclamation,\" the filing said.\n\nLawyers with the Department of Justice insisted in a court filing Sunday that they removed \"gang members\" pursuant to Trump's Alien Enemies Act proclamation before the court issued its order.\n\nHowever, lawyers representing some of the migrants argued that assertion not only conflicts with the timeline of events but also misconstrues when the United States loses jurisdiction of the noncitizens.\n\n\"Whether or not the planes had cleared U.S. territory, the U.S. retained custody at least until the planes landed and the individuals were turned over to foreign governments,\" the plaintiffs' filing said. \"And the Court could not have been clearer that it was concerned with losing jurisdiction and authority to order the individuals returned if they were handed over to foreign governments, not with whether the planes had cleared U.S. territory or had even landed in another country.\"\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys said that based on publicly available information, it appears that two flights carrying migrants under the Alien Enemies Act landed after the court's verbal and written orders. They added that \"public comments made by Defendants and the President of El Salvador\" boasting about the court being \"too late\" to stop the deportations reinforces concerns that the Trump administration may have violated the order.\n\n\"Defendants could have turned the plane around without handing over individuals subject to the Proclamation and this Court's [Temporary Restraining Order],\" the lawyers argued.\n\nFinding the deportations would cause irreparable harm, Boasberg's temporary restraining order on Saturday barred the Trump administration from deporting \"all non-citizens who are subject to the AEA proclamation\" for at least 14 days.\n\n\"You shall inform your clients of this immediately any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,\" Boasberg said during Saturday's hearing. \"However that's accomplished, turning around the plane, or not embarking anyone on the plane. ... This is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.\"",

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nIn 1929, a memo by the solicitor general to the attorney general on pardons held that \"neither the Constitution nor any statute prescribes the method by which Executive clemency shall be exercised or evidenced.\"\n\n\"It is wholly a matter for the President to decide, as a practical question of administrative policy,\" the department said. \"Nobody but the President can exercise the power, but the power having been exercised the method of making a record and evidence thereof is a mere detail which he can prescribe in accordance with what he deems to be the practical necessities and proprieties of the situation.\"\n\nThe memo was cited in a federal appeals court ruling just last year that said pardons don't necessarily have to be in writing.\n\nAnd while autopens (mechanical devices used to automatically add a signature to a document) have come under scrutiny in the past, the Justice Department as recently as 2005 determined they were constitutional and could be used for a president to sign a bill into law in a study commissioned by then-President George W. Bush.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama used an autopen to extend the Patriot Act, avert a fiscal crisis and more during his administration. Other presidents, including Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy, are also documented as having used the device or one similar.\n\n\"If the autopen is illegal, then many of the actions and regulations that presidents have done for the past four or five decades are null and void. It's a ridiculous argument,\" said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"There is nothing in the Constitution that requires that a pardon must be signed without an autopen. Obviously, that is a 20th century invention, and earlier presidents had no access to such technology. Nonetheless, Trump has zero authority to undo a Biden pardon, just as the next president has no authority to undo Trump's pardons,\" said Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law expert at the University of North Carolina.\n\nABC News has inquired with Biden’s team and the current White House to learn more about their autopen usage but has not received comment.\n\nPresident Joe Biden delivers his farewell address to the nation from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Jan. 15, 2025.

He spoke several times in his final media interviews about how he was considering such an option for people he feared could be targeted in the next administration, such as Liz Cheney or Anthony Fauci.\n\nWhat would happen if Trump tried to ignore or challenge Biden's action?\n\n\"It could open a Pandora's box if a sitting president tried to undo a pardon by one of their predecessors. The better rule would be that pardons -- whether perceived as 'good' or 'bad' decisions -- should be final,\" said Crouch.\n\nABC News' Molly Nagle and Nicholas Kerr contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Thousands of spectators have lined the streets of an Arkansas city known its St. Patrick's Day parade for more than two decades for an unusual reason\n\nHOT SPRINGS, Ark. -- Cities like New York and Chicago boast some of the largest St. Patrick's Day parades, attracting thousands of revelers and plenty of green beer.\n\nBut a city in Arkansas has gained popularity over the years with its parade for an entirely different reason. The city of Hot Springs, a resort town known for its mineral-rich waters, promotes its 98-foot (30-meter) route as the World's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade.\n\nThousands of people lined the streets Monday to watch the parade, which has been one of the city's biggest draws for more than two decades. Over the years, the event has gained the attention of celebrities, and this year, actor Valerie Bertinelli and rap icon Flavor Flav participated.\n\nSteve Arrison, CEO of Visit Hot Springs, said the idea began in 2003 when he and a group of friends were at a downtown restaurant “drinking adult beverages” and the topic of St. Patrick's Day came up.\n\n“We got to talking and said, well, why don't we have a parade?” Arrison said.\n\nThe parade began the following year and drew about 1,500 people. More than 30,000 people watch the parade each year, organizers say.\n\nFor the world's shortest, the parade packs in a lot. They'll have 40 different floats, and participants included 100 members of a group of Elvis Presley impersonators known as the International Order of the Marching Irish Elvi.\n\nAnother float featured the local chapter of the International Society of Helen Ropers, with participants dressed up as the character from the 1970s sitcom, “Three's Company.”\n\nThe parade has also featured a celebrity grand marshal and parade starter, and over the years has included familiar faces such as actor Kevin Bacon, “Cheers” star George Wendt and country music star Justin Moore. This year, Bertinelli was the grand marshal and Flav, the official starter.\n\n“We're not doing small stuff here. This is big,” Bertinelli said before the parade.\n\nThe parade even created its own green version of the signature clock necklace that Flav, a founding member of Public Enemy, is known for wearing. Flav, who celebrated his birthday on Sunday, danced along the route, enthusiastically greeting parade watchers.\n\n“I can have fun in a five-foot parade. Ninety-eight feet gives me a little bit more time to have more fun,” Flav, said before the parade.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders, who have participated in the parade for the past several years, sat in the back of cars and threw beads to crowds along the route.\n\nThe parade includes other events, including a concert and a “Blarney Stone kissing contest.” Before the parade kicked off there was an official measuring of the route to verify its shortness. A bugler from Oaklawn, a Hot Springs horse track and casino, marked the start.\n\n“I've been to Chicago, I've been to Savannah, Georgia. I like this one better than any of them,\" said Chuck Last, from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, who has gone to the past two parades.\n\nOther parades have tried to lay claim to being the shortest in recent years, including two cities in New York that dueled over who had the shortest parade. Another 78-pace parade was planned in Bemidji, Minnesota, on Monday.\n\nThe Hot Springs parade's organizers also keep up a feud with another parade in Adamsville, Rhode Island that claims its 89-foot (27-meter) route is the shortest. But Arrison dismisses their claim, noting that city's parade is held on the day before St. Patrick's Day.\n\nArrison also notes that the Hot Springs event has copyrighted the title “World's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade.”",

The former hostage, released last month in the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, recalled that the digging teams rotated in nine-hour shifts. In the 17 months since the terrorist organization launched its surprise rampage through Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas appears to have survived Israel's withering bombing campaigns through the ceaseless expansion of its vast web of tunnels that honeycomb underneath Gaza and has come to be known by Israeli officials as \"the Metro.\"\n\nShoham said he and three others were kept in a 120-square-foot tunnel shaft for more than 200 days, nearly half of the total 505 days he was held captive by Hamas. To get there, he told me he was led on a two-and-a-half hour walk through \"the metro,\" shocked at its labyrinthine sprawl beneath the Gaza Strip. He said the main line of the metro -- which Shoham says Hamas told him connects northern and southern Gaza -- is likely still intact, and every day teams dig new branches and shafts to the surface. His Hamas captors said you could walk for five days from Gaza City in the north to Rafah in the south, according to Shoham. He said Hamas was very proud of the work.\n\nTal Shoham, a hostage who was held in Gaza since the deadly October 7, 2023 attack, reacts as he is reunited with his family, after he was released as part of a hostages-prisoners swap and a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel, February 22, 2025. GPO via Reuters\n\nOn about day 300 into his time as a hostage of Hamas, Shoham said he was dressed like a Gazan man, walked out of the safe house where he'd been kept and led on a meandering walk through Gaza's streets to meet an ambulance, which then ferried him into a tunnel structure. Shoham was then blindfolded and said he descended into an underground space. He said his captors then removed his blindfold and he had to duck low to get into the first level, where, looking up, he saw what he described as a huge improvised explosive device that he said his captors told him was meant to collapse the tunnel should the Israel Defense Forces enter it.\n\nAs he descended further, he said, the air smothered him -- damp, dank and yet thin, as if at altitude. He had been told he was going to a doctor, but instead was introduced to hell, he said: a 50-foot long, 3-foot wide tunnel 60 feet underground where there were three other men. The four of them slept (head to toe), defecated and nursed the wounds of their beatings there for nearly a year. At one point, Shoham said they were given a deck of cards, but could only play two at a time because the tunnel was too narrow for the four of them to sit in a circle. It took Shoham a month to acclimatize to the lack of oxygen, and much longer to the claustrophobia of living in the coffin-wide tube, he said. The smell of food from the air-conditioned guards' room would waft it in. There was talk of suicide, Shoham said, but because their guards so feared that happening, they installed cameras in the tunnel and supplied the hostages a single set of plastic utensils that they used (and never cleaned with water) for the 200 days he spent underground.\n\nShoham had been kidnapped with his family from the kibbutz of Be'eri in southern Israel. He was taken first, he said -- before 20 of their neighbors and friends had been murdered. During the first six weeks of his captivity, Shoham was racked with obsessive thoughts about their fate. He said he would toggle through different scenarios: that his wife Adi would be dead and their two kids survived, one child dead and the other killed, or \"hardest of all that just my wife Adi survived\" and the children killed. So to end the pain, he said he decided to bury them: \"I imagined a big grave and two small ones with all of my community in my village and behind me, and like I gave a speech to every one of them. And it was the toughest thing that I did in my life. But I feel that I actually need to do it. I actually need to not only to [...] do it for myself, but in case they are dead, just to let them go.\"\n\nABC News' Matt Gutman interviews freed Israeli hostage Tal Shoham, who was held captive by Hamas for more than 500 days. Hugo Leenhardt/ABC News\n\nA few days later, he said he learned they had been taken captive, and were among 50 mostly women and children released during a temporary ceasefire of the war that was reached in November 2023.\n\nAfter about 30 days in captivity, Shoham said Guy Gilboa-Dalal and Evyatar David were brought to the safe house where he was being held. About nine months later, the three of them were taken underground and left where he said they were put in a tunnel along with fellow hostage Omer Wenkert, whom Shoham said was already there.\n\nBut for 40-year-old Shoham, it got far worse. An infection started in his mouth and gums, then came the pain and inflammation, the opening of old wounds, then the swelling in his legs and the inability to walk, he said. He was bedridden, and his fellow hostages darkly joked he \"was a dead man walking.\" He said Hamas captors brought a medic down, but they couldn't diagnose the problem, so they gave him antibiotics. Only after Shoham's release in February did doctors diagnose him with a malady so common to sailors before the 18th century: advanced scurvy.\n\nShoham had gone from 179 pounds to 110 pounds during his time in captivity, he said. The four men counted grains of rice to ensure they were divided equally. Shoham said their guards told them they were being purposely starved so that, upon their release, the images of their skeletal frames and sunken faces would inflame the Israeli public and force the Netanyahu government to broker a deal. But Hamas' plan backfired. When the world saw hostage Eli Sharabi, released on Feb. 8, there was an outcry. In the last two weeks of his captivity, Shoham said he and the others were stuffed with food. He was 124 pounds when the Red Cross ferried him back to Israel.\n\nThe foreman of the tunnel team would beat them with a crowbar, Shoham said, denting the head of Wenkert, then asked the hostages to massage him and ask them why they don't love him -- a special kind of sadism.\n\nThe ceasefire between Hamas and Israel was reached in January, and 25 living hostages were released as part of the first phase, as well as the bodies of eight deceased hostages, the following month. Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel were also released.\n\nBut there's been a slowdown of negotiations for the second phase of the agreement, which was to see Israeli forces completely withdraw from the Gaza Strip; the release of the 59 remaining Israeli male hostages, civilians and soldiers in exchange for an agreed-upon number of prisoners in Israeli jails, and a permanent cessation of military operations and hostilities, officials have said.",

The sale took place on March 10, coinciding with the stock's largest single-day decline in five years.\n\nAccording to one filing, the shares were sold \"to cover the exercise price relating to the exercise of stock options to purchase 531,787 shares, which are scheduled to expire in 2025.\"\n\nElon Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, who also sits on the board, unloaded 75,000 shares worth approximately $27 million last month, according to a filing.\n\nThe chairman of the board, Robyn Denholm, has offloaded more than $75 million dollars worth of shares in two transactions in the past five weeks, federal filings show. The selloffs made by Denholm came as part of a predetermined sales plan.\n\nA number of board members and executives made similar moves in November and December. But the recent sales come at a tumultuous time for Tesla, with the stock falling nearly 50% from a peak in mid-December. The company's shares have suffered most of those losses since President Donald Trump took office and Musk began his controversial governmental cost-cutting efforts as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTesla Cybertrucks are seen parked at a dealership, on March 12, 2025, in Plano, Texas. Julio Cortez/AP\n\n\"Whenever insiders, including directors, are selling shares, it's not a positive signal,\" Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, told ABC News.\n\nHowever, Ritter added, an exception applies to the predetermined sales plan adopted by Denholm in July 2024, which marks a routine effort to avoid the perception an officer unloaded shares based on inside information.\n\n\"Filing a plan months ago to sell some of those shares over time is common,\" Ritter said.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at research firm Morningstar who studies the electric vehicle industry, said some of the stock sales may owe to personal financial choices made by individual officers.\n\n\"While a sale doesn't necessarily mean an executive or board member feels negatively about a company's outlook, it could mean they think the stock is at a fair price or even overvalued,\" Goldstein said.\n\nThe share selloffs made by board members and executives totaled about $118 million, but the transactions often came after the individuals exercised stock options, the costs of which totaled about $16 million. The officers ended up with a profit of just over $100 million.\n\nABC News previously reported on concerns from shareholders and pension funds, some of whom have called on Musk to turn his attention back from slashing government spending to running his car company.\n\nTesla Chief Financial officer Vaibhav Taneja also sold off shares totaling more than $5 million over recent weeks. Some of those transactions came as part of predetermined sales plans, but a transaction earlier this month did not stem from a scheduled sale.",

        "content": "No more bald jokes, girls.\n\nI’ll be the first to say that superficial comments and judgments about someone’s physical appearance are not cool. But to label bald jokes a form of sexual harassment? Seems a bit extreme.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nApparently, the High Court thinks otherwise.\n\nThis whole lengthy case started back in 2019 when an electrician named Tony Finn accused his boss of sexual harassment. Allegedly, Finn’s boss at the British Bung Company had referred to him as a “stupid bald cunt.”\n\nMaybe this is my American sensibilities, but I’m thinking maybe the C-word is more of an issue here—but I digress.\n\nAccording to the panel of judges, led by Judge Jonathan Brain, the term “bald” is “inherently related to gender,” so using it against a man could breach equality laws. In other words, “bald” is a sexist insult.\n\nThe three-person panel also stated that the remark “crossed a line” and there is “a connection between the word ‘bald’ and the protected characteristic of sex.”\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the panel consisted of three bald men.\n\n“[Baldness] is much more prevalent in men than women,” they said. (K, well, tell that to the PCOS community.)\n\nNow, according to The Sun, the full judgment made at the Employment Appeals Tribunal has finally been published—four years after the initial comments against Finn. The electrician will likely receive compensation for the alleged sexual harassment.\n\nAs expected, this case is gaining major traction on social media, with many users expressing their disbelief over the ruling.\n\n“This is silly,” one person wrote. “We should all strive to be better people and to be more understanding and supportive with those who are missing something. But it seems silly to waste the court’s time with things so small.”\n\nMost others labeled the notion as nonsense.\n\nHowever, one person posed a different perspective: “I think it’s a bit extreme, but I can see the precedent. If people cannot joke about something a woman cannot control, then why should they be able to joke about something a man cannot control?”\n\nShrugs.",

        "content": "You have to respect someone who knows what they love and isn’t afraid to make it known. President Donald Trump has an affinity for Diet Coke—yes, you read that right—and it’s an affinity that’s so strong he built a damn button on the Oval Office desk to notify White House staffers to fill his cup up.\n\nNow, this is technically not a new thing. When he first took office in 2017 through 2021, he installed a red button—I’m imagining it looks like the ‘That Was Easy’ Staples’ button—on the desk. With him returning to the office this week, he didn’t waste any time in bringing the button back. The Wall Street Journal confirmed that the contraption was quickly set up in the office Monday, meaning it was a part of his extensive Day 1 activities in the office.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAgain, I have to say you have to appreciate someone so committed to what they love. Now I’m just wondering to myself what I would install a button for. One for Michelob Ultra refills? Or a button that brings me soft pretzels whenever my heart desires? The opportunities are endless.\n\nDonald Trump’s Diet Coke Button is Back in Washington\n\nThe Coca-Cola company is well aware of Trump’s fandom of its beverages. They even gave him a commemorative bottle recently with an old-school soda bottle and a White House label on it that listed his Jan. 20 Inauguration Day. It was presented to him by the company’s CEO, James Quince.\n\nDuring his first term, the New York Times revealed just how obsessed he is with Diet Coke. Trump reportedly drinks 12 cans a day. There’s no way that’s healthy, right? I drink one of them, and I instantly hate myself for consuming the sugary drink.\n\nMore power to you, Trump. By this point, his body has gotta be comprised of 75% Diet Coke flowing through him.",

        "title": "The Dark Dreams of Curtis Yarvin, Trump 2.0’s Big Tech Preachertroll",
        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "This is a members-only article from the forthcoming comeback issue of VICE Magazine. To subscribe, visit our membership section—not only will you get four issues of the printed magazine each year, delivered to your door, you’ll also have exclusive early access to our best new documentaries and online content, as well as a raft of members’ perks.\n\nAt the outset of the year, Curtis Yarvin—the blogger whose vision of a new, autocratic U.S. is reportedly gaining traction within the Trump administration—leapt back into the mainstream spotlight, with a New York Times interview headlined: “Curtis Yarvin Says Democracy Is Done. Powerful Conservatives Are Listening.” The article was accompanied by a moody monochromatic portrait that exaggerates Yarvin’s jowls like a veristic bust. One animated version of the photo shows Yarvin ominously drumming his fingers on a table. The implication seems clear: Do those restless fingertips contain the fate of the nation?\n\nIncreasingly, Yarvin has been touted by the media as a key to understanding the American New Right—a Steve Bannonesque figurehead, but for its tech faction rather than its nativist-populist one. He’s a computer engineer who’s been blogging away for decades in the strange world of online ‘neoreaction’ under the dusty fairytale pseudonym “Mencius Moldbug,” and is best known for his idea that American democracy should be replaced by a monarchy that runs the country like a start-up and grants generous privileges to the tech-industrialist elites.\n\nThis has won Yarvin friends in high places. His relationship with billionaire venture capitalist mega-donor Peter Thiel is well publicized. Marc Andreessen and J.D. Vance have cited his work approvingly. Now, with Trump settling back into the White House and indebted to the Bay Area robber barons that helped put him there, it feels as though Yarvin’s public profile has decisively shifted—from geeky fringe blogger to a political-philosopher éminence grise who is laying the discursive groundwork for an “American Caesar.”\n\nClearly, this is how Yarvin wants to be perceived. But take him at face value, and you’re playing a losing game. You’re not going to find a Schmitt or a Machiavelli here, and the joke’s on you for expecting that. Instead, Yarvin is best understood as a kind of spokesperson for ten million brain-fried Twitter anons, a cohort he’s described as the “new public intellectuals” of our “digital age,” and whose scattershot, stream-of-consciousness tub-thumping is currently being reflected in some punchy U.S. government policy. Whether that’s down to Yarvin is hard to discern. It seems unlikely. Yet what’s undeniable is that he finds himself arriving into a cultural moment for which he feels precision-engineered. In Yarvin, Big Tech has found the perfect preachertroll to exalt the deliberate insanity of the ‘move fast and break things’ ethos it’s bringing to nation building, one who knows how to exploit “meme magic” to dream up new truths about the world. In times past, people would’ve called this ‘throwing lots of shit at a wall and seeing what sticks.’ Today, they call it disruption, hyperstition, accelerationism, the future.\n\nThis is why the whole thing makes more sense if you understand Yarvin as a Gen X tech geek playing the part of a poet-guru; someone who can help Silicon Valley sheath its scary, transhumanist vision of the future in ancient mysticism and boomer cool. Look: he’s trying to be Gabriele D’Annunzio in a leather jacket. He’s trying to harness the infinite sexuality of the poète maudit. He wants us to understand that he’s a prophet who has visions; that with his musings on the nature of elves, he’s somehow hallucinating the polity of the future. His swagger is a bit awkward. He’s a socialite who attracts a following of eccentrics. Some people have told me that it’s Yarvin who was responsible for redpilling a lot of the Silicon Valley fat cats, persuading them to indulge their god complexes, insisting that it’s actually chic to openly flirt with immiserating elites and outmoded racial theories, as a way of priming them to support Trump and whoever comes next.\n\nPlay video\n\nIn his interview with the NY Times, Yarvin displays some of the shifty mannerisms you might expect of a contrarian online troll, an identity that to his credit he has partly owned. His habit of peppering italics through his writing is a way of signposting profundity where more often than not, there isn’t any. If you were to lay out his political program in his own style, it could be abridged such: America needs to stop edging and gooning and elect a bareback President, one who is given free rein to be orders of magnitude more powerful. Sounds delectably depraved, doesn’t it? And yet what he really means by that is none other than FDR— ‘And you libs like FDR, don’t you?’ he snickers. The fans are in on the joke but the outsiders tend to give up in frustration—there’s no ‘there’ there, they complain; it’s incoherent and contradictory, it’s childish, it’s a testament to the intellectual vacuity of fascism, there’s no way this sophist charlatan can have any real influence, and so on. Open the schools!\n\nOver the past few years I’ve had a bunch of funny encounters with Yarvin in New York, which he visits somewhat regularly, as if to make routine pilgrimage to the ancestral home of the Beat Generation. The first was a sunny summer day in 2022, at a meetup he had scheduled for his Substack subscribers in a park by the Hudson River. (He sometimes sends out newsletters advertising meetups in various cities; he once even put out a dating call to meet “someone of childbearing age.”) Dozens of Oxford shirt-wearing College Republicans surrounded the master, whose shoulder-length hair rested on his loose, half-buttoned saffron shirt that reminded me of the robes of Theravada monks. He stood in the grass and ruminated on Garibaldi. The disciples asked him questions like, “Who is the most overrated monarch in history?” The crowd was almost entirely male, and I remember some of the guys being disappointed, though not surprised, that no quirked-up cocquettecore girlies with bad politics were in attendance.\n\nLater, in the fall, I saw Yarvin debate the playwright Matthew Gasda on the Shakespeare authorship controversy at a smoky salon in Greenwich Village. If you’re not familiar with this ongoing argument, there’s an “Oxfordian” thesis that the 17th century aristocrat Edward de Vere was the true author of Shakespeare’s works, and that Shakespeare had actually just been De Vere’s rentboy. This was the position Yarvin was arguing; to him, there is simply no way that a lowly, common-born fellow like Shakespeare could ever have portrayed the machinations of aristocratic life so accurately. Gasda—a sort of earnest Belle and Sebastian conservative himself—was arguing the widely accepted “Stratfordian” position, and had studied all night so he was ready to defend the Bard’s honor. Yarvin’s approach was more flippant. “Suppose a corpus of witty, erudite academic novels, set in an unnamed Ivy League English department,” he posited, “is published under the name of an illiterate immigrant from Ghana, who sells sunglasses on a blanket on the street in Morningside Heights?”\n\nIt was a line that sounded familiar, because Yarvin had already published it in a blog on his Substack. Clearly, the Ghanaian immigrant analogy is his go-to line on this subject. In his closing arguments, he went on to suggest that De Vere couldn’t put his own name to his works of genius because he was part of an Elizabethan bohemia of poet-spies who ran psyops for the Queen. Whether the Oxfordian thesis is actually true isn’t so important to Yarvin. What is? Hyperstitioning alternate histories to sow disbelief in the institutions of liberal modernity, ideally in the flippant manner of a social media shitposter. And who better to lap up these myths than the chain-smoking Dimes Square beatniks in the audience?\n\n“The mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level”\n\nIn the following years, I’d run into Yarvin every now and then at salons in other downtown basements. Sometime around Christmas 2023 I went to a reading where the venue hosts, fearing antifa-Dadaist direct action, had hired a bouncer to ensure the poet’s safety. In his signature winter look of all-black jeans and leather jacket, he read works from favorites like W.H. Auden, Robert Lowell, and Robinson Jeffers, as well as some original writing. I found one poem of his—“War”—particularly striking, for how it tried to channel the Futurist ecstasy of combat though the experience of looking at your phone:\n\n“I spend too much time\n\nOn Twitter, following\n\nThe war—probably\n\nOn the wrong side—\n\nNothing is in me to care”\n\nFrom there, the speaker in Yarvin’s poem—presumably Yarvin himself—is mesmerized in a kaleidoscope of disinterested transhistorical enjoyment. The angel of history goonscrolls reality, which in 2025 is a titillating and contextless succession of thirst traps and snuff videos from the front. We learn that war is full of paradoxes—war is pointless but it’s also the only eternal thing in human existence, (“all else fades from the clays”); it’s cool as hell; it’s the worst thing ever; it’s all a big lie, but lies are cool (“The highest art is propaganda” begins another of Yarvin’s poems)—no, it’s peace that is fake; peace disappoints; peace is unsexy; it’s the opposite of love. Of course, this ode to war was probably written in comfortable conditions in Northern California, but the author knows what he’s playing at. The intense traumatic-erotic experience of industrial slaughter is the libidinal origin of fascism, and seems to be a model for Yarvin’s New Right ideology of the future. Yet crucially, the intensity is lacking; these horrors are something the poet and his audience can mostly only experience vicariously, through the internet.\n\nCURTIS YARVIN IN DEFIANT MOOD IN HIS BELOVED NYC. PHOTO BY NICK DOVE.\n\nWhat my experiences in New York tell me is that the mainstream framing of Yarvin as the brains behind an imminent post-democratic America—even when intended as ridicule—is one destined to fail, as it takes his bait on some level, validating the idea of his real proximity to power. Even as Trump seems to be attempting some version of the RAGE (Retire All Government Employees) plan that Yarvin has laid out in his blogs, the actual writing is less a guidebook of practical decisions for the American Caesar than a word soup of dazzling lies intended to chip away at the received wisdom of liberal modernity itself.\n\nCase in point: When Yarvin suggests that the wellbeing of Black Americans actually declined after slavery, he’s not interested in a good-faith historical argument. What he seeks to do is undermine the idea that All Men Are Created Equal. He certainly doesn’t need to convince Trump of that one, and it’s not like what Yarvin has to say will be of any direct help in the administration’s coming attempts to destroy the Civil Rights Act. It’s the nativist faction, the intra-administration rivals of Yarvin’s benefactors, who have that covered.\n\nYarvin has a much different function. His dream is to win over the lookers-on: the College Republicans, the Silicon Valley elites, and in New York’s bars and smoke-filled salons the clouted “cool kids” who will one day be in positions of media power great enough to help rewrite history—and maybe let Yarvin fulfill his destiny as the great prophet of a new age of illiteracy, tyranny, and digital psychedelia.\n\nFollow Michael Crumplar @mcrumps",

        "title": "This Cult 1990s Cyber Porno Predicted Our Horny Dystopian Present",
        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "A skyscraper looms over the shadowy streets of a lifeless near-future metropolis. Inside, a straitjacketed prisoner screams from his dank cell as scientists ponder his unusual condition.\n\nThese ominous scenes come from a movie released in 1995. Ostensibly, it was the story of a man who could read people’s souls, granting him access to their deepest, darkest fantasies, but it also carried with it an unerring prophecy. The movie warned that the future waiting just 30 years ahead of us would be a high tech authoritarian dystopia, where an infinite well of hardcore porn lurked just below the surface of life at all times, and the lines between reality and fiction had totally vanished.\n\nIn our present moment—with the tech oligarchy ascendent, the algorithm serving us treacherous dollops of AI slop, and X.com a haunted house of thirst traps and boot-licking amateur phrenologists—these themes seem eerily prescient. But this wasn’t a David Cronenberg classic or a manga sci-fi that’s currently enjoying some sort of critical renaissance on Mubi. This was Latex: A two-hour porno packed with blowjobs, gang-bangs, and boat loads of fetish.\n\nPlay video\n\nCelebrated within the adult industry at the time for its strikingly ambitious and innovative production standards, this award-winning “masterpiece” of “cinematic pornography” has been all but forgotten. But now, 30 years since its release, it feels more than ripe for reappraisal. I tracked down producer Jane Hamilton—aka Veronica Hart, a veteran star of the Golden Age of Porn—to unpack the mysterious legacy of Latex.\n\nIT PREDICTED OUR ‘BLACK MIRROR’ SOCIETY\n\nVia YouTube\n\nTaking place in a CGI metropolis of pink neon, flickering video billboards, and CRT monitors, the ominous setting of Latex feels like a cross between 1984 and a neo-noir Playstation One game—which also feels like a decent shorthand for the real world that we have all come to inhabit today. “A lot of the imagery harkened back to Metropolis,” explains Hamilton, referring to Fritz Lang’s German Expressionist class war fable from 1927—a rather unexpected aesthetic touchpoint for a skin flick. “It was really ambitious. Nobody was doing anything at all like that in adult,” she says. “People were like, ‘What the fuck is this?’”\n\nIronically, given the DIY, OnlyFans-led nature of the industry today, Latex was better at predicting our current social conditions than it was representative of the 2020s porn landscape. The mid 90s were the era of artistic revolution in pornography. Previously, Hamilton tells me, adult movies had been storyless “sex loops” ogled in the shadowy depths of garages and men’s clubs. Then came the 70s “porno chic” era, which saw narrative movies like Deep Throat and The Devil in Miss Jones gain mainstream recognition. But the idea of real “artistic, creative sensibility” in porn, according to Hamilton, didn’t kick off until the 90s.\n\n“The name of the game,” she says, “was to stand out from the pack.” Cue Latex director Michael Ninn, whose lavish, technologically ambitious spectacles were “style and visuals above all else.” Hamilton believes that the publicity-shy and enigmatic filmmaker could have been a highly paid ad director on Fifth Avenue if he’d wanted. And it was Ninn’s cutting-edge vision that made Latex such a unique and prescient work.\n\n1990S UK CLUB WEAR IS THE HEIGHT OF FASHION\n\nVia YouTube\n\n“We looked to England for fashion,” confirms Hamilton, describing how fetish zine Skin Two provided inspiration for Latex’s wardrobe of blonde bob wigs and Teletubbies-colored PVC.\n\nPornSTARS ARE the new CELEBRITIES\n\nPlay video\n\nFor all its sci-fi rumpy pumpy, the most compelling drama in Latex comes from its fascinatingly earnest lead performances. “The acting of Jeanna Fine and Jon Dough… is pretty fantastic,” remarks sex movie review blog House of Self Indulgence, before conceding that “the top-notch pathos [of one black-and-white flashback sequence] quickly falls by the wayside when the vapid TV hostess is double-teamed.” Such commitment wasn’t always guaranteed—during the shooting, some performers arrived on set after “working all night, without even taking a shower,” Hamilton recalls. Those actors “probably wouldn’t be able to work at McDonald’s.” But those who put in the effort could transcend the entire industry.\n\nCrossover success was not unheard of: Marilyn Chambers, one of the biggest pornstars of the 70s, was top-billed in the aforementioned Cronenberg’s 1977 horror film Rabid. And the 90s saw the gulf between adult and mainstream entertainment narrow. By the year 2000, ‘Alt-porn’ pioneer Gregory Dark was directing music videos for Britney Spears (“From the Bottom of My Broken Heart”) and conceptualizing them for Linkin Park (“One Step Closer”). A few years later, Jenna Jameson’s autobiography became a New York Times Best Seller and she appeared in Family Guy and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater. The stars from Latex flirted with mainstream recognition, too: Fine’s naked torso appeared in cult crime thriller The Boondock Saints in 1999, and Dough—a veteran of over 1,400 adult videos and one of the industry’s biggest stars—was the subject of two Louis Theroux documentaries for the BBC.\n\nBut by far the biggest mainstream success story from Latex was Hamilton herself. In 1996, she was cast as a judge in the Academy Award-nominated Boogie Nights—with director Paul Thomas Anderson declaring her “the Meryl Streep of porn”—and went on to make appearances in shows like Six Feet Under. These days? “I play dead people a lot,” she says, describing a recent background role on HBO series The Bookie. “And I was just in an Ariana Grande music video as a bartender.”\n\nporn soundtracks ARE artforms\n\nPlay video\n\nAdult movie soundtracks have been certified cool since 2015, after cult dance label Dark Entries started reissuing Patrick Cowley’s 80s back catalogue. The hypnotic synth score of Latex offers another sensuous example of the sub-genre.\n\n“Music was hugely important to [Ninn],” says Hamilton. The director composed much of the score himself, and managed a band called Eros prior to his career in porn, taking them on tour across Asia. “He knew all about the Gregorian chants and stuff,” she continues, describing the inspiration for the Latex OST. “But when I turned him on to Enigma, he just flipped.”\n\nThe German electronic music outfit, famous for New Age hits like “Return to Innocence,” would inspire the film’s relentless score, which elsewhere nods to acts like Delerium through its relentless techno beats, MIDI pads, and ethereal sighs. Vinyl release when?\n\nTHE ARTS ARE BROKE\n\nVia YouTube\n\nAt the 1996 Adult Video News Awards (AVN)—often billed as the “Oscars of porn”—Latex took home 11 of the 14 prizes it was nominated for, including Best Actor (Dough), Best Director (Ninn), Best Music, and Best Video Feature. And though Ninn’s visionary approach didn’t always guarantee success (his 20-episode CGI porn series Playboy’s Dark Justice was, Hamilton recalls, “described somewhere as ‘the worst show ever run on Playboy’”), he would become one of the porn scene’s most celebrated filmmakers by the turn of the millennium. AVN ranked Latex third on its list of ‘The 101 Greatest Adult Tapes of All Time’ in 2001.\n\nAnd yet… while the 90s had been all about style and ambition, the new millennium ushered in a change of tone. Suddenly, everything was “completely amateur, with people looking to get a feeling of real sex,” says Hamilton. It was a trend that continued unabated: by 2016, up to 95 percent of productions were “gonzo” shoots, claimed feminist scholar Shira Tarrant. And with YouTube style shorts and subscription models now the norm, the industry doesn’t have the time or money for visionary epics. “We’ve been through the same thing as the music business,” she says. “There’s money to be made, but not enough to justify one project having $200,000 spent on it.”\n\nWith internet piracy and websites like Pornhub driving down profits, actors are rarely able to win multi-film contracts—and are now usually paid per scene. Over-saturation of the market means that the more daring work of yore has gone from view. “I don’t even have copies of a lot of the movies we’ve made,” Hamilton says, “and I’d like people to be able to see them.”\n\nIn 2025, at least, Latex is still floating around the more illicit corners of cyberspace (and on Amazon and HMV)—a reminder of a time when pornography wasn’t just faux sex tapes and free streaming sites, but a wildly ambitious and influential artform in itself, not to mention one that occasionally seemed capable of predicting the future.\n\nFollow James Balmont on X @jamesbalmont",

She starred at Cornell University, where she was a team captain and hit the 100-point mark for the University.\n\nShe turned pro and spent time with the Calgary Inferno before playing internationally in Sweden.\n\nAfter her playing days, she was a trailblazer in the American Hockey League as the first female coach with the Kraken’s minor league team, the Coachella Valley Firebuds. She was there from 2022 to 2024 before moving to the NHL.\n\nHow Many Women Coach in other leagues?\n\nWhile Campbell broke down the walls at the NHL level, the other three major leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA) have already done so.\n\nAt the start of the 2024 season, 15 women held full-time coaching positions in the NFL.\n\nIn 2023, MLB had 43 women coaching.\n\nBecky Hammon was the first woman to serve as an acting head coach, with the San Antonio Spurs in 2020.

        "content": "British comedian Jamali Maddix is well known around these parts for his acclaimed VICELAND show on zealots, racists, and other angry people, Hate Thy Neighbor. Lately, Jamali’s been back on the extremist beat, hanging out with pedophile hunters and a gun cult led by a man named ‘King Bullethead’ for a new TV docuseries.\n\nWe called him up to get a read on Follow The Leader, set to air from September 17th in the UK.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nVICE: Hey Jamali. Obviously this beat is a familiar one for you. But how have extreme ways of thinking, cults, etc. all developed and changed in recent years?\n\nJamali Maddix: I think the internet changed everything when it comes to those communities. If there was a small group in a small town in America, it stayed within that small town in America. But things spread more now, so you’ve got movements or ideas that can spread easily. And the cost of making content has dropped dramatically. So you’ve got men and women making their content, of whatever their ideas are, at a high quality—and they can push it out on the biggest channel in the world, which is the internet, you know? So I think these ideas are more easily accessible than ever.\n\nYeah, it’s also interesting how everyone’s nan now seems to have quite a fringe view of the world.\n\nWhen it comes to certain views—maybe political or low-end conspiratorial views—it’s also because there’s so much information. I think it’s difficult for certain generations to decipher what is and isn’t real, because there’s a generation of people who grew up when newspapers were just… I mean, obviously, there’s always been lies in newspapers, but journalists investigated a story and then they presented the story, maybe with a twinge of political bias, but they presented pretty much the story—and now it’s just, “I can make a website and say whatever I want,” and it’s considered fact. So I don’t think everyone’s got a ‘fringe’ view. It’s just some people can’t decipher between what is the real and the fake thing on the internet.\n\nAI images are going to change things a lot as well, because they will actually trick people’s eyes into thinking real images—things that have never happened—actually happened. It’s gonna be a weird future.\n\nWhat role has COVID played in all this?\n\nI think people during COVID had a lot of time to think. It’s not my line, but a comedian once said to me: “Some people have too much time to think, and they have arguments with themselves that they always win.” I think people had so much time on their hands, and they reflected on their life and made more brash decisions.\n\nIn terms of the new series, Rod of Iron [a militant pro-gun offshoot of the Moonies religious movement, led by brothers Yung Jin Moon and Kook-jin Moon] used a lot of people’s apprehension [of the vaccine] to draw more people towards their ideas.\n\nJamali shares a moment wtih an interviewee in ‘follow the leader’ (credit: uktv)\n\nSo what’s some of the exciting new stuff that you unearthed while shooting this series?\n\nI enjoyed doing the predator hunter one; I enjoyed doing the passport bro one. I don’t know what mad things I uncovered. I don’t think there was like a mad…\n\nPredator hunter as in like…?\n\nIt’s people who they’ve alleged to have spoken to underaged children, and then they go and confront them.\n\nI think there’s something a bit off about that.\n\nYeah. In the film, it’s that complication. That’s what the film’s about, is the complicated nature of it, because we all agree that’s a bad crime, but it’s like, should they be… you know what I mean? All those questions get thrown up, and there isn’t really a definitive answer to it. That’s how I wanted to make it. I wanted it to be as if the audience member decides for themselves, where their morality lies within it, you know?\n\nHas anything in your films made you feel like “we’re fucked”?\n\nI felt that going in.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think that’s just apparent with the state of the world. I don’t think my docs are going to be the change of that; I’m not the canary in the coal mine. Human beings, we just adjust. If you would have said pre-COVID, there’ll be a time when you can’t go out for two years. You would have gone, “Nah, fucking I’ll go mad.” But you did it. You know what I mean? If you went to prison in fucking, the world’s worst prison, the first few days [would be tough], but after a couple months, you’d adjust. That’s just how human beings are. We just adjust, or we don’t and we don’t survive. And I think human beings just survive. So I think wherever the world goes, whether it’s the internet or whether it’s this, we just adjust, or we don’t. That’s the two options we have. The films are just exploring what’s going on and the people behind it.\n\nJamali Maddix: Follow The Leader airs on U&Dave at 10PM each Tuesday from 17th September, with the box-set available to stream free on U from Tuesday 17th September.\n\nFollow Nick Thompson on X at @niche_t_",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump has suffered through plenty of painful courtroom defeats during his lengthy career as one of America’s most litigious businessmen.\n\nThis time looks different. He’s now officially overdue to receive a downright brutal judicial ruling in a case that threatens to dismember his business empire, drain his cash reserves and drive him out of New York State as a businessman forever.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nManhattan Supreme Court Justice Aurthur Engoron blew through a self-imposed soft end-of-the-month deadline on Wednesday to deliver a judgment in the sweeping multi-million fraud lawsuit brought by the New York Attorney General Letitia James. Trump and his company have already been found liable, and are now just waiting to find out the size of the punishment. That decision could land at any moment, zapping Trump’s business like a thunderbolt when it does, in what could easily be the largest financial penalty of Trump’s life.\n\nThe New York Attorney General’s Office is seeking $370 million, along with a lifetime ban on Trump working in New York real estate or serving as an executive or director of a company based in the state. Judge Engoron declared Trump and his business liable for fraudulently overstating Trump’s wealth for financial gain in September. Now, the same judge bears sole responsibility for setting the penalty. A spokesperson for the court said Thursday that the ruling has been delayed until early to mid-February.\n\nA $370 million fine would follow Trump’s $83 million defamation loss to writer E. Jean Carroll, in a lawsuit over Trump’s derisive denials of Carroll’s claim that Trump raped her in a New York department store bathroom in the 1990s.\n\nSuch mammoth judgements dwarf notable courtroom defeats Trump has faced in the past.\n\nTrump’s company was fined only $1.6 million when it was found criminally liable in late 2022 for paying executives in off-the-books perks in what prosecutors branded an illegal scheme to minimize taxes.\n\nWhen Trump settled three lawsuits brought against his Trump University real estate training program in November 2016, right after he was elected president, he paid out a total of $25 million. In that instance, the NY Attorney General’s office had accused the operation of fraud, saying the unaccredited, for-profit venture misled its customers by calling the business a “university.”\n\nThe New York AG also had a hand in shutting down the Donald J. Trump Foundation, the personal charity Trump founded in 1987, through a lawsuit that forced the operation to dissolve in 2018. The office accused the charity of engaging in “persistently illegal conduct,” and said Trump used the foundation for his personal and political benefit. Yet when the foundation was shuttered, it was only forced to pay out less than $4 million to eight different charities.\n\nThis time, the stakes are much higher.\n\nThe potential combined $450 million in damages from both the New York fraud lawsuit and the Carroll case would equal roughly 15 percent of Trump’s $3.1 billion fortune, as estimated by Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nTrump himself has boasted that his net worth amounts to some $10 billion or more, but independent experts generally assess his real fortune to be only a fraction of that amount, although still likely in the billions.\n\nTrump claimed last year that his cash stockpiles are “substantially in excess” of $400 million. He may in fact have $600 million in cash, according to Bloomberg estimates.\n\nTrump’s company is notoriously opaque, meaning that it’s hard to know exactly how much damage losing $450 million would inflict. Most of Trump’s known wealth is held in the form of real estate, including Trump Tower and residential and commercial buildings in Manhattan; golf courses around the country; the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida; and his Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, NY.\n\nTrump has often boasted about the amount of cash he keeps lying around.\n\n“We have a lot of cash,” Trump said in a deposition with New York attorney general’s office lawyers in April 2023. “I believe we have substantially in excess of $400 million in cash, which is a lot for a developer. Developers usually don’t have cash. They have assets, not cash. We have, I believe, $400-plus [million] and going up very substantially every month.”\n\nTrump won’t have to pay the full amount for either penalty immediately, and hopes to appeal both losses. But the amount will grow while he appeals, rising by 9 percent annually, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump spent approximately $50 million in donor money on legal bills and investigation-related expenses in 2023, The New York Times reported on Wednesday. All told, Trump’s various legal committees spent roughly $210 million in 2023, while raising only $200 million, according to Politico. In other words, Trump’s legal fees are draining resources from his political operation, which spent more last year than it took in despite Trump’s incessant fundraising.\n\nThen there’s the question of whether, once this case and its appeals are all wrapped up, Trump’s family business will even be allowed to continue to exist in its current state.\n\nIn September, Judge Engoron caused a stir when, upon finding that Trump had committed fraud, he ordered the revocation of many state certificates Trump needs to run his companies. The judge said that the companies, which hold many of Trump’s assets including Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, should be turned over to a receiver for “dissolution.”\n\nWhen asked whether he meant that Trump’s buildings should be sold off, Judge Engoron demurred, saying he’d clarify his precise meaning later. That September order is now under appeal.\n\nYet so far Trump has lodged several other appeals related to the fraud case, including an attempt to remove James from the case, dismiss the suit completely and block multiple subpoenas.\n\nAlmost all of those efforts have failed.",

        "content": "Another day, another creative— though failed—attempt at smuggling drugs. Colombian officials at Rafael Nunez International Airport were in for a surprise when they discovered someone attempting to get one by them through a disguise. A man was departing on an Amsterdam flight when he was footsteps away from stepping onto his plane when authorities pulled him aside because they were suspicious of… his hair.\n\nExcept it wasn’t his hair, it was a wig. While he made it through the security checkpoints and presumably thought he was in the clear, the 40-year-old dealer was monitored leading up to the boarding process. Eventually, the suspicion grew to a point where they had to step in and investigate what they suspected was a unique smuggling vessel.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nA Drug Dealer Tried to Conceal Cocaine in His Wig—And Failed\n\nPhotos from the scene showed the man’s wig being cut into and beneath it was nine cocaine capsules, according to TMZ. The black wig was able to conceal them initially before the security scanner uncovered the secret.\n\nWhen the wig was fully cut off, it showed the pods engrained in the inner part of the wig. I can’t imagine it was comfortable at all, but it nearly worked. Props to security for suspecting that something was off about the hairdo. The BBC reports that the street value of the drugs, which weighed in at 220 grams, would have equated to $10,450 U.S. dollars.\n\nColumbia is known to be the most prevalent cocaine exporter in the country, so it’s no wonder that airport security has its guard up for anything that seems out of place. Clearly, the wig set off enough alarms with officials that they tracked him throughout the airport before concluding that they needed to intervene before he headed to Amsterdam.\n\nIt’s been a busy month for wild drug dealing stories. The wig-concealing-cocaine tactic is the most interesting, but perhaps the most intricate was what came out of the Morocco and Spain border. That’s where a drug smuggling tunnel was discovered, connecting the two countries between the only land border.",

She’s the current Women’s Intercontinental Championship. She became the inaugural champion in January, defeating Dakota Kai. Since then her booking has been rather frustrating, as she’s rarely defended the belt. She was an entrant in the 2025 women’s Royal Rumble which isn’t unusual as other champions often appear. However, she already has a title that she had just won.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nBayley Earns WWE Title Shot Against Lyra Valkyria\n\nPlay video\n\nShe defended it just once in February against Kai in a rematch. Thus far in March, she won against Ivy Nile. However, next week, she is going up against Raquel Rodriguez. One-half of the women’s Tag Team Champions, Rodriguez defeated Bayley last week to earn the #1 Contendership for the Intercontinental Title.\n\nBayley, meanwhile, has been popping up all over the WWE. She’s been on Raw, SmackDown, and NXT where she began a feud with Cora Jade and Perez. With Perez now on the main roster, that has spilled over a bit, but she’s not had anything super substantial either.\n\nBayley could be just the type of opponent she needs to solidify herself as a champion. Valkyria lost to Bayley in non-title action last week, and it’s been weighing heavily on her mind. As stated in a backstage segment, she wants to prove she can beat the decorated veteran. There is currently no date set for the match.\n\nThe match Valkyria is referring to was an Elimination Chamber qualifying match pitting Bayley against Bianca Belair, Naomi, Alexa Bliss, and Roxanne Perez. While Bayley didn’t win to head to back-to-back WrestleMania Premium Live Events, if she were to beat Valkyria she could end up on the show anyway.\n\nStay tuned to VICE for updates on WWE",

For those craving new music from the band, two of its members just dropped a song, “Everybody Breaks,” with their hardcore side-project that will absolutely scratch the itch.\n\nXweaponX is a straight-edge hardcore band featuring Knocked Loose frontman Bryan Garris and guitarist Issac Hale. Here, however, Garris is playing bass and only doing the occasional vocals, while Hale does some vocals and continues to handle the guitar.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThey are joined by Gates to Hell drummer—and Bryan’s brother Trey Garris on drums, and Dave Baugher on lead vocals.\n\nPlay video\n\nKnocked Loose Hardcore Side Project XweaponX Drops Thunderous New Song ‘Everybody Breaks’\n\n“A blitz of metallic fury, this straight edge anthem roars to life with a machine gun burst of double-kick drums and bone-crushing riffs that split the air like a war cry,” reads a description of the song. “Vocalists Dave Baugher and Issac Hale deliver with pure, unfiltered anguish—shouting a call to arms against self-destruction and an outright accusation of weakness of spirit.”\n\n“Guitars churn and twist into dissonant chugs and razor-sharp harmonics, with every breakdown landing like a sledgehammer to the chest. It’s not just music—it’s a battle hymn, a sonic purging that unleashes the kind of ferocity that leaves nothing but wreckage in its wake.”\n\nFrankly, this description of the song is spot-fucking-on. It’s mean, per se, but it’s angry and indignant. The lyrical-musical balance is so perfect. There is an impeccable balance between what they’re saying and the relentless hardcore cacophony it’s partnered with. It’s going to be absolutely insane to see a crowd yell “You don’t have what it takes! Everybody breaks!” all together and then erupt into a billion stage dives. That’s what I predict.\n\n“Everybody Breaks” was recorded by Isaac Hale, mixed and mastered by Zach Tuch, and is out now through DAZE. It can be streamed HERE.\n\nFor anyone hoping to catch the band live, XweaponX only has two shows on the books at this time: April 25th at LDB Fest in Louisville, KY, followed by an appearance at Sound and Fury in July.",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "The family and friends of Johan Floderus, a Swedish diplomat potentially facing the death penalty in Iran, have told VICE News he has endured a “horrible situation” during his 20-month-long detention in a notorious Tehran prison.\n\nFlorerus, a 33-year-old working with Afghan refugees in Iran on behalf of the EU was detained in April 2022 at Tehran’s airport as he was visiting on a holiday trip and then accused of spying for Iran’s foes, in particular, Israel. He was charged and tried for “corruption on earth,” or stymieing the cause of the Iranian revolution, in the Islamic Republic’s religious courts, a charge that can be punished with death. He is the latest victim of a repeating pattern in which foreign nationals are entangled in a legal ordeal in Iran in order for the country’s ruling mullahs to extort money or other goals from the West.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nAfraid that quiet diplomacy wasn’t working, Floderus’s loved ones broke their silence in December last year and, on Thursday, went to Brussels to hold an event to raise awareness of his case with European officials.\n\nFloderus’s sister Ingrid told VICE News: “We are very close with Johan and always spoke on almost a daily basis. He is such a freedom-loving and stubborn person. Since his arrest, we have been only able to talk a few times. I can’t imagine how horrible the situation he is in, but he is still full of life and trying to stay strong.”\n\n“Johan is someone full of life and always had a curious soul, and he always traveled around the world and spoke Farsi, and he visited Iran multiple times, and worked there.”\n\nJohan Floderus in a sup\n\nIn Iran, all foreign nationals are closely monitored, and their movements must be approved by local authorities. Despite repeated calls from both the EU and Sweden to release Floderus, the Iranian judiciary has insisted that they have enough evidence to prosecute him on espionage charges.\n\nThe Swede is held in Tehran’s Evin prison and his case is being handled by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran, headed by the clerical judge, Iman Afshari, already notorious for his passing unjust prison sentences on political activists, artists, and women.\n\nLast Sunday, the court concluded Floderus’s hearing after five sessions in an almost-empty courtroom, which the Swedish man attended in a prison uniform with his state-appointed lawyer and translator. Mizan News, the Iranian judiciary’s official outlet, reported that the prosecutors accused Floderus of a “very extensive intelligence cooperation with the Zionist occupation regime,” and said that his travel history was clear evidence of his involvement in activities that “threaten Iran’s national security”.\n\nAfshari gave a week for Floderus’ lawyer to submit their defense, and did not give a verdict date.\n\nWant the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nDespite denials from the Iranian government, rights groups and Western governments have repeatedly accused the Islamic Republic of “hostage diplomacy” by using trumped-up charges such as “corruption on earth” to extract political concessions, release funds held abroad by international sanctions, or in prisoner exchanges.\n\nFloderus’s arrest is likely to put pressure on Sweden in the case of the arrest of Iranian former prison official Hamid Nouri.\n\nNouri was detained upon arrival at Stockholm Airport in November 2019, and later charged with involvement in the killing of thousands of Iranian political prisoners in 1988.\n\nJohan and his sister Ingrid.\n\nThe former prison official was sentenced to life “for grave breaches of international humanitarian law and murder,” by a Swedish court after the prosecution asked for the maximum penalty in July 2022. The outcome was hailed as a rare human rights success against Iranian regime officials, but outraged the government in Tehran, which called the case “politically motivated.”\n\nLast Sunday, the Iranian prosecutor asked for the maximum penalty in Floderus’s case – either life in prison or the death sentence given the “important nature and adverse affects of the accused’s actions.”\n\nThe diplomat’s family had kept quiet about the arrest on the advice of the Swedish authorities as they tried to resolve the issue through “silent diplomacy,” and launched a public campaign after the news broke out at the end of last year, and losing hope that Floderus would be released through back-channel talks.\n\n“Other governments go the distance to protect their citizens, and I hope that Sweden will do that too. Johan is my brother, and his freedom and well-being are the most important thing in the world. So of course I feel that you should use every tool in the toolbox,” said his sister, Ingrid.\n\nEmily Atkinson, a close friend of Floderus, said: “Johan is someone who always brings people together. We have been left with a massive gap in our life without him, and we are also being taken hostage by the appalling situation,” she said as she struggled to keep back tears during a conversation with VICE News\n\n“I want to say: Johan, hold on. We’re here for you. We’ve rallied for you. We’re speaking up for you, and we’re here waiting for you. Hold on and stay strong.”",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "Does the time of the month that a baby is conceived affect if it’s a boy or a girl?\n\nIt’s possible, says British mathematician Hannah Fry.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“The chances of a woman conceiving a male or female child actually very subtly changes depending on when in her cycle she conceives,” Fry explained in a video on her Instagram page. “So slightly earlier, ever so slightly more likely that she’ll have a baby boy.”\n\nHowever, Fry said the odds are “way too small” for couples to use that as a predictor.\n\nThe larger point of her investigation was analyzing gender trends over time. With data focusing on England and Wales, she explored something called the “returning soldier effect,” which shows spikes in male birth rates following World War I and II.\n\nThe trend, which has also been observed in other countries, has several possible explanations.\n\nOne controversial theory is that healthier soldiers are more likely to survive war and come home. That, combined with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis —which posits that healthier people are more likely to conceive boys—could explain the spike.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that the increase in male births is nature’s way of compensating for the loss of life during the war.\n\nThe ‘returning soldier effect’ is just one possible explanation for birth rate trends\n\nFry admits that there’s no way to tell for certain what causes more male births than female, or vice versa. There are also dozens, if not hundreds, of other factors that come into play, including the health of the mothers and environmental conditions.\n\nFor example, writing in 2008, William H. James observed a decline in male birth rates in Iran during and following the Iran-Iraq war. He attributed the fall to “psychological stress causing pregnant women disproportionately to abort male fetuses.”\n\nHowever, the “returning soldier effect” definitely has a basis in fact.\n\n“At the end of a war, everyone has much more sex than normal,” Fry noted. “Women get pregnant slightly earlier in their cycles, and as a result, there is a spike in the number of baby boys that are born.”",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "The cause of last year’s deadly wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, has been revealed. The August 2023 blaze that left more than 100 people dead was caused by the re-energization of broken utility lines in Lahaina, according to an investigation released Wednesday by the Maui Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nThe fire has been classified as accidental. Per the report, the re-energization of the line caused sparks, which ignited overgrown vegetation at a surrounding utility pole. The overhead and energized power line fell to the ground, further igniting vegetation.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nInvestigators initially believed they had extinguished the fire, which started around 6:30 AM, but undetected smoldering material reignited the second phase of the fire hours later, just before 3 PM.\n\n“We want to make abundantly clear to Lahaina and to our Maui community that our firefighters went above and beyond their due diligence to be as confident as they could be that the fire was completely extinguished before they left the scene,” Assistant Chief Jeffrey Giesea said, per NBC News.\n\nAccording to the report, “Fed by extreme winds, the fire quickly grew out of control, jumped the bypass, and resulted in the subsequent conflagration from which our island community is still recovering.”\n\nThe fire destroyed over 2,000 structures and caused $6 billion in damages.\n\nThe report’s findings may or may not sway conspiracy theorists who believe the U.S. government used directed energy weapons to cause the deadly blazes to turn Maui into a “smart island.”",

        "source": "https://news.vice.com/",
        "content": "More infants died in the U.S. after Roe V. Wade was overturned.\n\nEarlier this year, a Texas study found increased infant mortality rates in the 18 months after the state’s six-week abortion ban went into effect in 2021.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe latest study, which was penned by Parvati Singh and Dr. Maria Gallo and published in JAMA Pediatrics, built on that research. It took a look at infant mortality nationwide after Roe V. Wade was overturned in 2022.\n\nThe study found that infant mortality was up to seven percent higher than normal in certain months, which is equivalent to an average of 247 more deaths.\n\nThe jump was most pronounced—a 10 percent rise—among infants with congenital anomalies. That is likely due to more frail fetuses being carried to term amid abortion restrictions, the study suggested.\n\n“I’m not sure that people expected infant mortality rates to increase following Dobbs. It’s not necessarily what people were thinking about,” Gallo told Ohio State News. “But when you restrict access to health care it can cause a broader impact on public health than can be foreseen.”\n\nSingh agreed, telling CNN that the research “is evidence of a national ripple effect, regardless of state-level status.”\n\n“This is the tip of the iceberg,” she said. “Mortality is the ultimate outcome of any health condition. This is a very, very acute indicator. It could be representative of underlying morbidity and underlying hardship.”\n\nSingh told the first outlet that she now wants to explore maternal and infant mortality rates among various populations.\n\n“There’s a broader human toll to consider,” she said, “including mental health consequences of being denied abortion care or being forced to carry a fetus with a fatal genetic abnormality to term.”",

        "content": "Masked men recently proved the ongoing presence of anti-semites in America. During a performance of The Diary of Anne Frank in Michigan, a group of men holed up in front of the venue, waving Nazi flags and spewing slurs.\n\nThe Fowlerville Community Theatre was hosting the play at American Legion Devereaux Post 141 when they became aware of “the presence of self-identified Nazi protesters,” according to a press release.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nBobby Brite, past commander of the legion, recorded a video of the protestors and shared it to Facebook. He told The Detroit News that the group of 10 masked men chanted things including “Anne Frank was a whore” during their anti-semitic showing. Frank was 15 when she died at a concentration camp in 1945.\n\n“They are some of the most cowardly people I’ve ever met,” Brite told the outlet of the “absolutely disgusting” protest.\n\n“There was a group of people at the four-way intersection in downtown that had swastika flags and American flags,” Alex Sutfill, a witness, told the local CBS station. “They were sticking their arms up and yelling ‘Hail Hitler‘ and ‘Hail Trump’ and everything like that.”\n\nHow the Protest Was Handled\n\nThe theater group alerted the American Legion staff on duty of the situation and was assured they were already aware of and monitoring the men, who moved out of the legion’s parking lot when asked.\n\nAfterwards, the demonstrators went “across the street and waved flags adorned with Nazi insignia,” the Livingston County Sheriff’s Office told The Detroit News. “A subject then approached them, and an argument ensued.”\n\nPeter Damerow told the local CBS station that he was the one who confronted the group. In response, he claimed, “They looked at me and one of them said, ‘No this is Pureville now, and we’re here to make sure it stays pure.’”\n\n“Nothing physical transpired and ultimately the parties involved separated,” the sheriff’s office said.\n\nStill, “out of an abundance of caution,” the group alerted the audience members to the situation at intermission.\n\n“For this production, our cast was also on stage in character during intermission, which was when they found out as well,” the press release read. “Although some were understandably shaken, they pulled together and finished the performance with strength and professionalism.”\n\nHow the Situation Mirrors History\n\nChuck Firman, president of the Fowlerville Community Theatre, added in a statement to the The Detroit News, “It was a scary moment. But really, the show must go on.”\n\nThe theater’s press release further noted how the ordeal, which ended when the protestors left before the end of the show, “gave us a small glimpse of the fear and uncertainty felt by those in hiding.”\n\nIndeed, Brite told the local ABC station, “We had 75 people downstairs that watched that play and out of that 75, there were 50 or 60 of them that were afraid to leave this building. We had to escort them to their cars. No one in America should feel like that.”\n\n“As a theatre, we want to make people feel and think,” the press release read. “We hope that by presenting Anne’s story, we can help prevent the atrocities of the past from happening again.”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League’s Michigan outpost said In a statement, “disgusted by the far-right extremists who praised Hitler and waved Nazi flags” at the event.\n\nIn October, the organization found that, following Hamas’ October 2023 attack on Israel, there were 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the U.S. That’s a 200 percent increase from the previous year.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump utilized his first day back in office to put a handful of executive orders in motion, one of which was announcing the United States’ withdrawal from the WHO, the World Health Organization.\n\nThis wasn’t exactly a surprising move, considering Trump’s history with the organization. He attempted to remove the U.S. from the WHO in 2020 before Joe Biden overturned the decision and resumed funding for the organization. One of Trump’s major running points during his campaign was keeping American dollars in-house and not paying for what he perceived to be a waste of funds, which always meant the WHO was in jeopardy.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nTrump cited the organization’s “mishandling” of the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reason for the decision.\n\nDonald Trump Pulls The United States Out of the WHO\n\nAbove all else, it’s the money the country has invested in the WHO that ultimately fueled the decision. America has been the WHO’s largest donor since its inception in 1948. The country has routinely given around $163 million in yearly contributions, with that number going as high as over $800 million at times. There are up to 194 countries involved in the WHO, with America providing up to a fifth of the organization’s funding, per USA Today.\n\n“Everybody rips off the United States and that’s it—it’s not going to happen anymore,” Trump said on Monday during a press conference.\n\nWithout the United States providing funding, the WHO will now likely lean on China, which has typically been the next largest provider. The order signed by Trump on Monday specifically mentions the population size of China and the fact that, despite it being far larger than The States’, the country pays less than 90% of what America does to the WHO.\n\nJapan, Germany, and the United Kingdom have rounded out the top five contributing countries over the years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has yet to comment on Monday’s order.",

        "content": "For ten years, the latest interviewee on Informer—our series amplifying the voices of insiders and whistleblowers—consulted as a health and safety officer for the petroleum giant Shell, dealing with the psychological fallout of its voracious global expansion.\n\nTheir job was to listen to thousands of oil and gas workers airing their concerns about the professional hazards and mental and physical toll of working on the frontlines for a company like Shell. Some days, the job meant hearing from contracted workers in the Global South complaining that they hadn’t been paid. Other times, it would be counseling those driven into a state of extreme mental disrepair by allegedly working 31 days straight to keep the pipeline running.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\n“There’d be times I would close my eyes to go to bed at night and I would just picture burning bodies bobbing around in a water that was on fire,” our Informer says at one point during the interview. “That was basically the nightmare they were talking about that could come true.”\n\nThink your job is stressful? In our Informer’s first week at Shell, the company had to deal with a spill that created an oil slick the size of Belgium just off the Nigerian coast.\n\nHeavy shit indeed. You can watch the film now at YouTube or in the player below.\n\nPlay video\n\nNow, here’s an interview about the interview, with VICE director Alexi Phillips.\n\nVICE: First of all, thanks for making this intensely depressing film for me to watch. I haven’t slept since.\n\nAlexi Phillips: No worries.\n\nHow did the Shell informer first get in touch?\n\nI can’t really disclose that.\n\nMost of what’s talked about is disconcerting. How does this stuff stay out of the news?\n\nMost of these spills happen in countries that don’t get much media attention. Every once in a while a massive event, like what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, makes the news but the fact that there are thousands of tiny spills every day is just seen as more of the status quo and not remarkable enough to be ‘breaking news.’\n\nI was assuming the dangers of oil production would primarily be posed to the environment, or to members of the public whose lands or waters are suddenly destroyed by a big spill. I wasn’t expecting to hear that people actually working for these companies would be losing their lives, too.\n\nYeah, they are working in highly pressurized environments, with extremely combustible liquid and gas, so the risk is inherent—especially when they’re working offshore. But the danger is exacerbated by the crazy demands to continue pumping large quantities of oil, with a focus on profits above everything else.\n\nWhat surprised you most about what the Shell informer had to say?\n\nSadly, I was not that surprised. In all honesty I think that was my big takeaway from the interview. There was nothing she could tell me about that industry that would shock me or that I couldn’t believe.\n\nWhat changes do you hope these big oil companies to make in the future?\n\nI hope they get more robustly regulated, as I think they have demonstrated they cannot be trusted with our future.\n\nWhat changes do you expect these big oil companies to make in the future?\n\nI expect that they will talk a big talk and walk a tiny walk.\n\nYou can watch the latest episode of Informer now at YouTube.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Shell said: “Respect for human rights is fundamental to Shell’s core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and is embedded into our existing framework, such as our Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct details how employees, contractors and anyone else acting on behalf of Shell must behave to live up to our business principles.”",

        "content": "A group of Canadian firefighters are feeling the heat after their ill-fated Halloween bash. During the North Sydney Firefighters Club’s Halloween dance, a group of four people dressed up as members of the Ku Klux Klan joined in on the festivities.\n\nIn video obtained by CBC News, four people are seen entering the Nova Scotia party wearing white robes and pointed hoods. One person in the racist outfit was carrying a makeshift cross.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nIn a statement to Global News, Fire Chief Lloyd MacIntosh said the people in Ku Klux Klan costumes were admitted by volunteers working the door.\n\n“A mistake was made,” he admitted. “They were allowed in, they shouldn’t have been.”\n\nVolunteers asked the people to remove their hoods, but some refused, MacIntosh said. He added that a volunteer took away the cross one person was carrying.\n\nFirefighters Speak Out About the Racist Costume\n\nIn a statement posted to Facebook, the club admitted that it “made a mistake!”\n\n“We apologize to any and all of our community who were offended or hurt by our lack of actions,” the post read. “These four individuals are in no way, shape or form associated with our organization. We promise to be better in the future.”\n\nWade Gouthro, the Deputy Fire Chief, also spoke out about the controversy in a Facebook post.\n\n“I can honestly tell you that the situation at the North Sydney Firefighters club is not who we are or what we stand for,” Gouthro wrote, before admitting that he’d been “very reluctant” to address the situation due to fear of adding “fuel to the fire.”\n\n“I can tell you this, the members of North Sydney and myself are very sorry from the bottom of our hearts and we ask for your forgiveness,” he continued. “We would certainly never intentionally hurt or insult anyone regardless of race, color, orientation or religion. We spend all of our time trying to do right by the community and are here to do all we can for anyone.”\n\nGouthro added that being “referred to as racists hurts bad.”\n\nWhy KKK-Dressed Attendees Were Admitted to the Party\n\nWhile Gouthro was not working the party in question, he noted that he’s worked the annual event many times in the past.\n\n“When we have Halloween dances you never know what you are going to see come through the door,” he wrote. “Most times we think, ‘Ah it is a costume’ without really thinking of the big picture or the past it represents.”\n\n“So when you folks comment that they shouldn’t have gotten in and that we need to do better, you are right, and we will,” Gouthro continued. “… I will assure you that we are all hurting in our hearts today that we have disappointed a community that we work so hard to make better and protect.”\n\nHe concluded his post by “once again apologizing on behalf of myself and our membership and also a sincere promise to do better in the future.”",

        "content": "If you’re old enough to remember the DARE program, you probably remember the litany of unhinged rhetoric they used to try and convince you that smoking cannabis was not a good time and does not make you a cool dude. Among those was the claim that over time, cannabis makes you dumber and permanently damages your long term memory. Well, we can (maybe) put that one to bed along with the whole “gateway drug” thing. Because according to a study out of Denmark, cannabis users might actually experience less cognitive decline than non-cannabis users as they age.\n\nConscripted In Copenhagen\n\nA little background first: Ever since 1849, Denmark has required physically fit men over 18 years of age to be conscripted for 4-12 months of military service. On the way into this service, conscripts are given a cognitive test. That’s where the authors of this new study saw an opportunity. The test was re-administered to 5,162 men who were now around 64 years old, and then polled those men to see if they’d ever tried or habitually consumed cannabis.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe men who were habitual consumers of the devil’s lettuce actually scored higher on the cognitive test than those who didn’t, showing less overall cognitive decline over the around 44 year period between the first time they took the cognitive test and the re-test for this study. There are a lot of other factors that could play a role in these results, like lifestyle, income, and consumption of other intoxicants over time. But even accounting for those, the researchers still saw a slight uptick in cognitive function among the old stoner crowd.\n\nNot so fast, Grandpa\n\nThere’s a caveat, though. The margin is slim: cannabis consumers scored on average 1.3 points higher than non-cannabis users. Even the authors of the study say that much more research is needed before any medical conclusions can be drawn. Still, it’s an interesting result that flies in the face of conventional wisdom about cannabis. So don’t go getting your grandpa a bag of weed and a bong for Christmas just yet. Or do, just don’t expect that it’ll make him any better at, well, anything besides eating and saying inappropriate things at the dinner table.",

        "content": "A California prison is being placed under a microscope following a possible death by mail. The incident in question involves fentanyl-laced pages that may have killed a mailroom supervisor.\n\nAt the high-security US Penitentiary in Atwater, an inmate named Jamar Jones was allegedly sent mail from his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Ferreira and a man called Jersey Rudd III. Prosecutors say that multiple pages of the letter were “soaked” in drugs—including amphetamines, fentanyl, and “spice,” or synthetic cannabinoids, according to drug testing. They say the paper looked like it was dipped in wax.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe senders attempted to conceal the alleged drug shipment by sending it via “legal mail,” meant to be confidentially between an attorney and inmate. All three have been charged for conspiracy to distribute.\n\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, the mailroom supervisor, Marc Fischer, came in contact with the envelope and handled its pages. Within five minutes, he began stumbling around and told coworkers he was “having trouble breathing.” Fellow corrections officers called for medical support, and after two hours and a trip to the hospital, Fischer died.\n\nThe cause of death is still unknown and won’t be identified until toxicology reports are finalized. Secondhand fentanyl exposure shouldn’t be fatal, experts say.\n\nThis is hardly the first case of drug-soaked mail in prisons. In 2019, 122 federal prisons began photocopying inmate letters instead of giving them the originals in an attempt to stop the distribution of any drug concealed in mail or postage. A bill to mandate digital mail-scanning in prisons passed the Senate last year, but it stalled in the House.",

        "content": "A special court martial handed down a reprimand to an Army lieutenant colonel who was caught putting cameras in the dressing room of a clothing store by a 16-year-old girl. The Lt. Col., who fled from police when caught, pleaded guilty but will serve no jail time.\n\nThe slap on the wrist comes after civilian prosecutors initially attempted to pursue a criminal conviction. The Army convinced the court to let it handle the matter internally, however, and the officer was instead prosecuted through the Uniform Code of Military Justice. (UCMJ). Further, Motherboard found while seeking records related to the case that the court documents have since been sealed.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nThe case illustrates a disturbing trend where the Pentagon swoops in to protect its soldiers when they commit a crime. If convicted in a civilian court, Sweatland could have served up to a year in jail. Instead, a military judge issued a reprimand, an official black mark on Swetland’s military record.\n\nWhen asked if Sweatland would have to register as a sex offer, a representative for the U.S. Army Cadet Command told Motherboard it would comply with state law. “A court-martial convicted Lt. Col. Sweatland of a qualifying sex-related offense. The Army is complying with all sex-related offense processing requirements,” Maj. Dan Lessard, spokesman for U.S. Army Cadet Command, told Motherboard.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Lt. Col. Jacob Sweatland was the head of the Army’s Reserve Offcier’s Training Corps program at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. He was responsible for shaping a new generation of U.S. military officers. In September 2022, Sweatland left a key fob with a hidden camera in it at a PacSun in San Luis Obispo. A 16-year-old girl found the camera and turned it in, and the store called the cops.\n\nThe cops took a look at the camera and found it still contained images and video from other dressing rooms in the area. Sweatland later called the store asking if anyone had found his key fob. The clerk, who was working with police, told Sweatland that someone had found it and he could come and retrieve it. The cops were waiting at the scene.\n\nThe details of the case from San Luis Obispo court records which were publicly available at the time of Sweatland’s arrest but are now sealed as part of his plea deal. Pieces of the records still exist from local reporting over the past few years. According to the now-sealed court records, which said that Sweatland faced charges of resisting arrest and obstructing justice in addition to invasion of privacy, the Lt. Col. fled when he got to the store and saw the cops. The police eventually tracked Sweatland down and arrested him.\n\nMustang News, reporting based on court records that were available in 2023, said that Sweatland’s fob contained images from several locations including other retail establishments and the gym at the Cal Poly Rec center. The video was shot “from covert angles” and showed “women’s backsides as they [preformed] various exercises wearing shorts and tight fitting athletic wear.” At the time of his arrest, Sweatland was removed from his position at the University but wasn’t charged for the recordings because they were taken in a public area.\n\nAs the case against Sweatland moved forward last year, he and his lawyers did what they could to avoid civilian justice. Before the case was handed over to military prosecutors, Sweatland attempted to get it dismissed as a “Military Diversion.” In California, veterans and servicemembers can ask for courts to dismiss charges if the defendant is “suffering from sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems as a result of his or her military service.”\n\nAccording to court records, Sweatland’s defense team claimed that he’d undergone intensive therapy since his arrest. Sweatland’s service was no joke, he deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Colombia and earned a Bronze Star and a Ranger Tab. He saw combat and it’s possible he’s suffering from service related PTSD. But the court of SLO wasn’t buying it.\n\n“The calculated and covert method in which Defendant repeatedly targeted vulnerable young women demonstrates little potential for rehabilitation in the Military Diversion Program,” court records filed by the prosecutors said.\n\nAfter his attempt at using the Military Diversion Program was thwarted, the Army stepped in.\n\n“When disposing of allegations of misconduct, the Army regularly coordinates with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and prosecution authorities. In July 2023, the San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office initiated contact with the Army and requested the Army prosecute this case,” Lessard said. “After careful consideration of the evidence and in consultation with the victim, the Army preferred court-martial charges against Lt. Col. Sweatland on July 13, 2023.”\n\nThe military conducted an investigation of its own and handed down the reprimand during a special court martial. “On Jan. 22, 2024, at a special court-martial convened at Fort Knox, Ky., Lt. Col. Jacob J. Sweatland was convicted by a military judge, pursuant to his pleas, of one specification of indecent visual recording and one specification of conduct unbecoming an officer in violation of Articles 120c and 133, UCMJ. The military judge sentenced the accused to be reprimanded. The sentence was consistent with the terms of a plea agreement,” Lessard told Motherboard.\n\nHe explained that a reprimand is a punitive public censure. “A reprimand reflects negatively on a soldier’s military record and negatively affects a soldier’s career,” Lessard said. Despite the black mark, Sweatland does still have a career. He is currently assigned to the 8th Brigade of U.S. Army Cadet Command and is serving in an administrative role away from cadets.”\n\nThe Sweatland case highlights a problem with civilian-military relations and the Pentagon writ large. This is a persistent problem in the Army. In 2017, a soldier at Fort Hood allegedly assaulted his wife and fired a gun as she fled their home. The Army kicked him out of the service but did not pursue a case against him. The same thing happened the same year in Alaska after a soldier was accused of sexually assaulting a fellow soldier.\n\nIn both cases, there was physical evidence of the crime and no prosecution. The soldiers were simply allowed to return to civilian life. The Pentagon often runs cover for its soldiers, which creates a separate system of justice for those who serve.\n\nMotherboard asked Cadet Command to respond to concerns that the Army’s handling of Sweatland would be viewed as a slap on the wrist. “A court-martial convicted and punished Lt. Col. Sweatland under adherence to the rules and procedures prescribed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice. We have no further comment on this matter while it is subject to appellate review,” Lessard said.\n\nUpdate 2/9: This article was updated with more information from U.S. Army Cadet Command spokesperson Maj. Dan Lessard and the subhed has been changed to reflect this information.",

        "title": "Trump and Putin to Discuss Ukraine Cease-Fire",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is set to hold talks on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin as he looks to get buy-in on a U.S. ceasefire proposal that he hopes can create a pathway to ending Russia’s devastating war on Ukraine. The White House is optimistic that peace is within reach even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky remains skeptical that Putin is doing much beyond paying lip service to Trump as Russian forces continue to pound his country.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe engagement is just the latest turn in dramatically shifting U.S.-Russia relations as Trump has made quickly ending the conflict a top priority, even at the expense of straining ties with longtime American allies who want Putin to pay a price for the invasion. “It’s a bad situation in Russia, and it’s a bad situation in Ukraine,” Trump told reporters on Monday. “What’s happening in Ukraine is not good, but we’re going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace. And I think we’ll be able to do it.” In preparation for the Trump-Putin call, White House special envoy Steve Witkoff met last week with Putin in Moscow to discuss the proposal. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had persuaded senior Ukrainian officials during talks in Saudi Arabia to agree to the ceasefire framework. The U.S. president said Washington and Moscow have already begun discussing “dividing up certain assets” between Ukraine and Russia as part of a deal to end the conflict.\n\nTrump, who during his campaign pledged to quickly end the war, has at moments boasted of his relationship with Putin and blamed Ukraine for Russia’s unprovoked invasion, all while accusing Zelensky of unnecessarily prolonging the biggest land war in Europe since World War II. Trump has said that swaps of land and power plants will be part of the conversation with Putin. Witkoff and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested that U.S. and Russian officials have discussed the fate of the Zaporizhzhia power plant in southern Ukraine. The power plant has been caught in the crossfire since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022 and seized the facility shortly after. The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly expressed alarm about the nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, fueling fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe. The nuclear power plant is a significant asset, producing nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s electricity in the year before the war.\n\n“I can say we are on the 10th yard line of peace,” Leavitt said. “And we’ve never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment. And the president, as you know, is determined to get one done.” But Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, questioned whether Putin is ready to end the war or will hold out for potential further concessions as Trump grows impatient. After a disastrous Feb. 28 White House meeting with Zelensky, Trump temporarily cut off some military intelligence-sharing and aid to Ukraine. It was restored after the Ukrainians last week signed off on the Trump administration’s 30-day ceasefire proposal. “The U.S. has been consistently offering in some form preemptive concessions that have been weakening the American and Ukrainian negotiating position,” Bowman said. “I think there’s a real danger here that the administration’s approach is boiling down to sticks for Ukraine and carrots for Putin.”\n\nZelensky in his nightly video address on Monday made clear he remains doubtful that Putin is ready for peace. “Now, almost a week later, it’s clear to everyone in the world—even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years—that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war,” Zelensky said. In his dealings with Zelensky and Putin, Trump has frequently focused on who has the leverage. Putin has “the cards” and Zelensky does not, Trump has said repeatedly. Trump, who has long shown admiration for Putin, has also made clear he’d like to see the U.S.-Russia relationship return to a more normal footing. The president during his recent contentious meeting with Zelensky grumbled that “Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,” a reference to the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in which he beat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump on Monday again underscored his view that Ukraine is not in a strong negotiating position. He said Russian forces have “surrounded” Ukrainian troops in Russia’s Kursk region—amplifying an assertion made by Russian officials that’s been refuted by Zelensky.\n\nUkraine’s army stunned Russia in August last year by attacking across the border and taking control of an estimated 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of land. But Ukraine’s forces are now in retreat and it has all but lost a valuable bargaining chip, as momentum builds for a ceasefire with Russia.\n\nZelensky has acknowledged that the Ukrainians are on their back foot but refutes Russian claims that they have encircled his troops in Kursk.\n\nTrump suggested that he’s taken unspecified action that has kept Russia from slaughtering Ukrainian troops in Kursk.\n\n“They’re surrounded by Russian soldiers, and I believe if it wasn’t for me they wouldn’t be here any longer,” Trump said.\n\nLeavitt is one of three Trump administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",

But there’s one case that stayed with him.\n\nIn 2014, he was treating a woman in her late 20s suffering from bowel cancer—already a rare situation, given her age. But it became even more unusual when her best friend visited her in the hospital and told Frizelle that she had many of the same symptoms as his patient. Subsequent testing revealed that his patient’s friend had a lesion that, had it not been caught early, likely would have become cancerous. “That really brought it home to me—how it’s much more common than you think,” says Frizelle, a professor of surgery at the University of Otago in New Zealand.\n\nStill, like any good scientist, Frizelle was skeptical. Was it simply a fluke that he kept treating strikingly young patients? Or was his practice one tiny data point in a larger trend?\n\nHe found his answer after sifting through national health data: colorectal cancer, he discovered, was indeed being diagnosed more often than in previous years among New Zealanders under 50. Further research by Frizelle analyzing populations in Sweden and Scotland showed the same thing. A bigger picture was emerging. Here were three different countries, with different populations and health challenges—but united by a spike in colorectal cancers among young adults.\n\nPhotograph by Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nIn the years since, it’s become clear that the problem isn’t limited to those three countries, nor to colorectal cancer. Researchers have found that young people around the world are getting many different kinds of cancer at alarmingly high rates. And as the diagnoses of celebrities and public figures like Kate Middleton, Chadwick Boseman, Dwyane Wade, and Olivia Munn bring mass attention to the issue, scientists are racing to answer a question on the minds of many outside the medical profession: Why is cancer, historically a disease of old age, increasingly striking people in the primes of their lives?\n\nGlobally, diagnoses and deaths related to early-onset cancers—those affecting patients younger than 50—rose by 79% and 28%, respectively, from 1990 to 2019, according to a recent study published in the medical journal BMJ Oncology. In the U.S., breast cancer is the most common type of early-onset disease, but recent surges in cancers affecting digestive organs—including the colon, rectum, pancreas, and stomach—are particularly dramatic within this age group. In fact, today’s young adults are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer—and four times as likely to be diagnosed with rectal cancer—as those born around 1950, research suggests.\n\nRead More: The Unique Hell of Getting Cancer as a Young Adult\n\nOverall, cancer is still overwhelmingly an older person’s disease. As of 2025, 88% of people in the U.S. diagnosed with cancer were 50 or older, and 59% were 65 or older, according to data from the American Cancer Society. But there is no question that the demographics are shifting. Under 50s are not only at increasing risk of suffering from cancer; theirs is the only age group for which the risk is rising. All told, 17 types of cancer are on the rise among U.S. adults in this age group.\n\n“When we were younger, we assumed the climate would be the same forever. The same applies in cancer,” says Dr. Thomas Powles, a U.K.-based oncologist and cancer researcher who edits the journal Annals of Oncology. “We just assumed that cancer incidence was something that is relatively static. But it’s not.”\n\nThere is some good news in the data. Advances in disease detection and treatment, as well as dramatic declines in smoking, mean that far fewer people die from cancer now than once did. Although the disease still ranks as the second most common cause of death in the U.S., killing more than half a million people each year, mortality rates have dropped by about a third since 1991.\n\nLess encouragingly, the rate of new cancers diagnosed has remained stubbornly consistent, declining only modestly from 1999 to 2021. Across the U.S., roughly 2 million new cancer cases are detected each year, diagnoses that, on top of the emotional toll, force patients to cumulatively fork out billions of dollars in out-of-pocket costs—more than $16 billion in 2019 alone, according to federal data. Today, about 40 out of every 100 U.S. adults can expect to be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetimes. For an estimated 1 in 17 U.S. women and 1 in 29 U.S. men, that news will come before their 50th birthdays.\n\nThe rise in early-onset diagnoses partly comes down to advances in our ability to detect and diagnose different kinds of cancers. “With much more sophisticated tools now, inevitably we’re doing more tests on younger people [and] we’re using more accurate imaging,” which leads to more cancers detected, Powles says. Some screening protocols have also been modified in recent years to include younger adults; since 2018, for example, the American Cancer Society has recommended colonoscopies starting at age 45, down from 50.\n\nRead More: Some Early Forms of Breast Cancer May Not Need Treatment, Study Says\n\nBut this is only one part of what scientists say is a more complex web of factors they are still attempting to understand. The data suggest that some element—or perhaps combination of elements—of modern life is sickening progressively younger adults. And right now, no one knows for sure what that is.\n\nThere are plenty of known risk factors for cancer, from the genes someone is born with to the unhealthy lifestyle habits they pick up, such as smoking, drinking lots of alcohol, or spending time in the sun. Such habits can speed up the natural degradation of cells, which over time acquire genetic mutations as they lose their ability to repair damage. As that damage accumulates with age, cells may become cancerous, growing and -multiplying too fast for the body’s immune system to keep them in check and potentially choking out vital organs. The immune system also loses some of its strength with age, making it easier for cancer cells to colonize the body.\n\nBut classic risk factors do not seem to fully explain the recent rise in early-onset cancers, says Dr. Cathy Eng, director of the Young Adult Cancers Program at Vanderbilt University’s Ingram Cancer Center in Tennessee. Some of the trends are baffling; young, nonsmoking women, for example, are being diagnosed with lung cancer in strangely high numbers. Many times, Eng’s patients were extremely healthy: vegetarians, marathon runners, avid swimmers. “That’s why I really believe there’s other risk factors to account for this,” she says.\n\nKelly Spill, 33, was initially brushed aside by doctors who thought her cancer symptoms were related to pregnancy and birth. “If you don’t find your answers, keep pushing for them,” Spill says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nThere’s no shortage of theories about what those may be. Many scientists point to modern diets, which tend to be heavy on potentially carcinogenic products—including ultra-processed foods, red meat, and alcohol—and may also contribute to weight gain, another cancer risk factor. The foods we eat can also affect the gut microbiome, the colony of microbes that lives in the digestive system and appears linked to overall health. Alterations to the gut microbiome via diet, or perhaps exposure to drugs like antibiotics, have also been implicated.\n\nOther researchers blame the microplastics littering our environment and leaching into our food and water supplies, some of which, according to a 2024 study, have even shown up in cancer patients’ tumors. Other environmental factors could also be to blame, given that everything from cosmetics to food packaging contains substances that many researchers aren’t convinced are safe. Even our near constant exposure to artificial light could be messing with normal biological rhythms in ways that have profound health consequences, some research suggests.\n\nFor now, these are all just hypotheses. Some may turn out to be wrong, and more theories will emerge in time. It’s also likely that different risk factors are linked to different cancers, Frizelle says. Even in a single patient, multiple overlapping triggers may be in play.\n\nFrizelle’s research on colorectal cancer, for example, suggests there may be a dysfunctional relationship between microplastics, certain foods, and some types of gut bacteria. Studies suggest that when microplastics get into the body, they can penetrate the mucous lining that protects the bowels and carry bacteria and toxins to the bowel lining. This leaves the bowel more susceptible to damage from pathogens inside the body—including strains of gut bacteria that are known to become more virulent when they interact with compounds found in red and processed meat. In some patients, this perfect storm of invaders may result in cancer, Frizelle thinks.\n\nRead More: CNN’s Sara Sidner Is Demystifying Breast Cancer Treatment\n\nHe believes this overlapping puzzle of risk factors is a likelier explanation than any one lifestyle habit driving a dramatic uptick in cancers—especially since younger generations are, in many respects, healthier than their ancestors. In the U.S., for example, tobacco use has plummeted in recent decades, and young adults are increasingly unlikely to drink. “How is the health-conscious generation getting more bowel cancer?” Frizelle asks.\n\nDr. Andrea Cercek, co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, agrees that some early-onset cancer cases defy easy explanation. She’s treated patients in their 20s and even teens with tumors that, biologically, “look just like a regular 80-year-old’s tumor.” These cases stump her. “Even if they drank as a teenager, it just doesn’t make sense,” she says. A few years of drinking alcohol, following an unhealthy diet, or having obesity should not be enough to produce the kind of tumor typically seen in a senior citizen, Cercek says. And yet, there they are.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, credits his Christian faith with helping him live with lung cancer for more than a decade. “When I was first diagnosed, I was searching on Google for anybody who was a survivor, and I couldn’t find no one,” he says. “There is hope. There are people who are living long and having a great quality of life.” Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nTo Cercek, these advanced tumors suggest that people have been exposed to damaging substances for a long time, perhaps even longer than they were aware of. Research and awareness about early-onset cancer is accumulating now, but the source of the problem may not be new, Cercek says. It can take years for even the most toxic exposures to result in health problems—which means that the source of a problem in the public eye now may have emerged decades ago, silently sickening people until the trend became too pronounced to ignore.\n\nGiancarlo Oviedo-Mori, 32, is one of many patients whose cancer defies obvious explanation. When he was in high school, Oviedo-Mori developed a persistent cough that didn’t respond to medication. Eventually, at just 18 years old, he was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer.\n\nOviedo-Mori and his doctors were stunned. He’d had asthma as a child growing up in Peru, but he had no family history of cancer and had never been a drinker or smoker; he was barely even old enough to buy cigarettes and still years shy of his 21st birthday. Oviedo-Mori’s family spent a day observing the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack when toxic particles were still in the air, but it had been a brief visit and no one else in the family had developed health problems. That was the only exposure he could think of. The diagnosis didn’t make sense. “It was so weird,” he says.\n\nRead More: 4 Important Steps to Take After a Cancer Diagnosis\n\nAs he went through cancer treatment—including chemotherapy, radiation, and a surgery that removed his entire left lung—he’d look at his fellow patients, and, seeing how much older they were, feel out of place. “I didn’t belong there,” he says.\n\nMore than a decade later, Oviedo-Mori is still in treatment, participating in a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering (where all the patients pictured in this article have received care) in hopes of ridding his body of cancer for good. But, though he’s still fighting cancer, he is in good health—he can even play soccer, despite having only one lung, and chase after his almost 2-year-old son. “Sometimes, I don’t believe it,” he says. “I think about [my son] and I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re really a miracle.’”\n\nFiguring out how young people like Oviedo-Mori fall prey to cancer is not easy, given the sheer number of potential health hazards in the modern world. It is a puzzle with an unknown number of pieces—one that Dr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is trying to solve with a technique he pioneered.\n\nDr. Shuji Ogino, a pathologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, is studying early-onset cancer using a unique approach that combines epidemiology (the study of population-level health trends) and molecular pathology (the granular analysis of a patient’s tumor). He believes this unlikely pairing will help uncover triggers for early-onset disease. Sophie Park for TIME\n\nOgino and his team are making their way through about 4,000 colorectal tumor samples that came from people who developed the disease at various points in their lives. Each sliver of tissue holds innumerable clues about the person it belonged to, from what they ate and drank to the bacteria that lived in their body before cancer took root. To unearth these clues, the researchers stain the tissues, so that under the lens of a powerful microscope, they can see the different types of cells in the tumor in brilliant color. Using these cell-level insights, they can distinguish between the tumors of young vs. older patients and—with the help of AI—search reams of scientific literature for environmental exposures, lifestyle habits, or health conditions linked to particular cellular traits. Repeating this painstaking detective work enough times helps reveal patterns among young cancer patients, giving Ogino and his team clues as to what may have caused their diseases.\n\nTheir research has already pointed to some possible answers for early-onset colorectal cancer. The big three so far are eating a typical Western diet (high in sugar, processed foods, and red meat, low in fresh produce), developing insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes also linked to poor diet), and having a particular type of E. coli bacteria in the gut. Nothing is proven yet, Ogino says. But since there’s no harm in eating healthfully, he believes dietary changes are worth making now.\n\nOgino personally drinks very little and eats a healthy diet. He makes sure his young son eats well too, since his research makes him acutely aware of the importance of developing healthy habits starting from a very young age. But even for children as young as Ogino’s son, some damage may already be done—at least according to Dr. George Barreto, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Flinders University in South Australia.\n\nRead More: 8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety\n\nBarreto—who started researching early-onset cancer after not just his patients, but also several of his relatives and friends, were diagnosed at young ages—has theorized that damage may start in the womb. It’s well established that the pre-natal period can have long-term effects on a baby’s health, and Barreto believes that phenomenon may extend to cancer risk if parents are exposed to carcinogens during this critical developmental time. This theory could help explain mysterious cases like those Cercek describes, involving patients who seemingly haven’t lived long enough for even their riskiest habits to catch up with them.\n\nProving his theory won’t be simple, Barreto acknowledges. It would require collecting data on huge numbers of people, starting before they were even born, then sifting through that data to pinpoint relevant prenatal and early-life triggers. To speed up the process, Barreto has contacted more than 20 research groups around the world that are tracking groups of people beginning at or before birth, in hopes of using their data to jump-start his research. “If we start [from scratch] now, it will take us 40 years to find answers,” Barreto says. That’s too long to wait, with patients already getting sick at an alarming rate.\n\nThere is yet another question for researchers to answer: whether, on a molecular level, young patients’ cancers are dramatically different from those that occur in older people. If so, these findings may guide researchers toward new treatment approaches.\n\nSome research, including by Eng, has pointed to molecular differences, at least among patients with early-onset colorectal disease. But other scientists are less convinced. Powles, the U.K. oncologist, says he hasn’t seen strong evidence to suggest that early-onset cancers are much different or more aggressive than later-in-life cancers; they just happen to strike patients at younger ages.\n\nCarrie Regan, 41, went to the ER in 2023 because of stomach pain, which led to an ovarian cancer diagnosis. Regan is now in good health and is monitored for recurrence. She wants other women to be vigilant about their health, since ovarian cancer symptoms, like bloating and cramps, are easy to miss. “The day I went to the ER, there was a long wait and I started to feel better. I almost left,” she says. The fact that she didn’t saved her life. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\nEven if there is no medical requirement to stray from classic treatment methods—like chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery—younger patients have unique needs. Standard treatments, while often effective, can be destructive for people with decades of life ahead of them, potentially leading to life-altering physical changes, like permanently needing a colostomy bag or enduring early menopause and infertility. “The worst thing [for an oncologist to hear] is, ‘I’m cured and my cancer’s gone, but I wish that I’d just lived with my cancer because living like this isn’t living,’” Cercek says.\n\nKelly Spill was blindsided when she was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer in 2020. She was only 28, had no family history of colorectal cancer, and had recently given birth to her first child. She was even more stunned when she learned that her treatment would force her to permanently use a colostomy bag and leave her unable to carry more children. “That completely broke me,” she says. “I’d always wanted a big family.”\n\nJust before she was set to start chemotherapy, however, a research nurse told her she might be a fit for an experimental trial that Cercek was leading. Cercek was testing a new approach among patients whose tumors had a specific genetic mutation: using intravenous medication to boost their immune systems’ abilities to recognize and attack cancerous cells, ideally sparing patients from chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.\n\nRead More: What to Do If Your Doctor Doesn’t Take Your Symptoms Seriously\n\nDespite all the unknowns that came with participating in a clinical trial, Spill says it was a “no-brainer” to try Cercek’s approach instead of therapies that would leave her with lifelong physical side effects. Her gamble paid off: by her ninth treatment session, her tumor had entirely disappeared. Spill is still cancer-free and expecting her third baby in May.\n\nIn June, Cercek reported that out of 41 rectal cancer patients who completed the full regimen, 100% were cancer-free and required no additional treatment. She is now also studying the method against a variety of different cancers, ranging from stomach to bladder. A patient of any age could benefit from this approach, Cercek says, but it could be particularly impactful for young patients, like Spill, who are desperate to avoid permanent side effects.\n\nEven without novel medical approaches, cancer centers are beginning to recognize that, compared with elderly patients, “adolescents and young adults have very different experiences, and therefore need very different approaches to their treatment,” says Alison Silberman, CEO of Stupid Cancer, a nonprofit that supports young people with the disease. Physical fallout isn’t the only hurdle to overcome, Silberman says. Compared with older patients, young people are more likely to struggle to pay for their care and to develop mental-health issues as a result of it.\n\nSilberman witnessed these challenges when her brother was diagnosed with advanced cancer in his 20s. “He was yanked out of his life,” forced to leave his job and apartment to move back in with their parents, Silberman remembers. Cancer made him grapple with his own mortality, largely on his own. “He was too old to be a pediatric patient, too young to be an adult patient,” she says. “That was very isolating for him.”\n\nImtiaz Hussain, 31, says cancer is seen as “kind of untreatable” in his native Pakistan. He no longer thinks so, after joining a clinical trial run by Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Dr. Andrea Cercek. After just a few months of treatment with an experimental immunotherapy drug, Hussain felt better. Today, he is cancer-free and a father of three. “I was a part of history,” he says. Frankie Alduino for TIME\n\n“Care of early-onset cancer patients becomes complex even beyond [medicine],” says Dr. Veda Giri, an oncologist and co-director of Yale Cancer Center’s Early Onset Cancer Program in Connecticut. This spring, the program will launch new services meant to address that very problem. Patients in the program will be contacted by coordinators who can help guide them through issues that commonly affect young-adult patients, from ways to preserve fertility to deciding whether to pursue genetic testing or enroll in a clinical trial. Patients can also participate in support groups with others in their age group, in hopes of improving social and mental health. The goal: to “support patients and their families from diagnosis all the way through their cancer journey and beyond into survivorship,” since young adults cured of cancer may have continuing needs for decades to come, Giri says.\n\nThe ultimate goal, of course—and the ultimate win for doctors and researchers working in this field—will be for early-onset cancer centers to be rendered unnecessary. But it likely won’t happen anytime soon. Proponents of sophisticated new artificial-intelligence technologies have raised expectations, promising new tools that could transform cancer research. AI gives scientists the ability to sift through mountains of data with hitherto unimaginable levels of precision. And the hope is that these tools will unlock a cascade of new discoveries—illuminating unrecognized risk factors, for example, and turbocharging the development of new treatments.\n\nBut cancer researchers remain cautious. There is hope, no doubt—but like the legions of scientists grappling with complex medical puzzles in other fields, they are wary of overstating the pace of progress and raising the hopes of patients, even with new technologies at their disposal.\n\n“It will be impossible to design a clinical trial that can test all different possible causes of early-onset cancer,” says Dr. Andrew Chan, director of cancer epidemiology at Mass General Cancer Center. AI and other technologies may help land on those possible causes faster. But to really understand exactly what’s driving the disease and how to stop it, researchers must work slowly and methodically, studying various potential triggers—from diet to alcohol to microplastics—one by one.\n\nRead More: 8 Ways to Shorten Your Wait for a Doctor’s Appointment\n\nChan’s team is starting with a trial that will study whether losing weight with the help of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound affects future cancer risk among people who have survived early-onset cancer and who are overweight. Future research may study the effects of specific dietary changes, he says. But not all potential cancer triggers are as straightforward to modify as weight and diet.\n\nTake microplastics, which Frizelle, the New Zealand surgeon, believes are contributing to early-onset cancer. Frizelle is realistic about their ubiquity. Avoiding them is all but impossible in a world where water supplies are tainted and babies suckle on plastic bottles from their earliest days on earth. Barreto’s research on cancer risk starting in the womb paints an even bleaker picture, suggesting that the deck may be stacked against some people before they are really people at all. (He chooses to see it more optimistically, noting that everyone can still “take the power into their own hands” by avoiding known carcinogens.)\n\nThe upshot of all this: it could take years, if not decades, to sort out what’s causing early diagnoses, and perhaps even more time to figure out how to stop them. What seems so obvious to us now—the conclusion that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, for example—took some 40 years for scientists to solidify. Even once they did, change didn’t happen overnight. Smoking rates have fallen steadily since public-health warnings escalated in the 1960s, but they didn’t plummet all at once. Still, change is possible. Today, smoking is at historic lows, and lung cancer diagnoses have declined with them.\n\nIf the challenge sounds daunting, for researchers like Ogino, from Brigham and Women’s, the complexities are part of the process. He is reminded every day that good science takes as long as it takes. Many of the tumor samples he relies on in his research came from participants enrolled in a study that launched in 1976. The researchers who started it couldn’t have known that, 50 years later, their work would be critical in the quest to reverse the rise of early-onset cancer, Ogino says.\n\n“That’s the kind of legacy you can make in science,” he says. “That’s a great, rewarding way to contribute”—even if it takes a lot of time to get there.",

        "title": "Can Trump Void Biden’s Presidential Pardons?",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "On Monday, President Donald Trump signaled that he intends to nullify the presidential pardons—issued to those on the House Jan. 6 committee that investigated Trump—executed by President Joe Biden because, he said, they were signed via autopen. “The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,” the President shared on his social media platform Truth Social. “In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them! The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut according to the U.S. Constitution, the President has no such authority to overturn his predecessor’s pardons, especially not based on the type of signature, legal experts say. “The Constitution doesn't even require that the pardon be written, so the idea that the signature is by autopen rather than by handwritten signature seems not relevant to the constitutionality because Article II just says that the President has the power to pardon,” says Bernadette Meyler, a Stanford Law School professor and constitutional law expert. Autopen is an electronic signature that allows individuals to sign a document without physically being there. The signature mimics a handwritten signature, but is done by a computer. A vast number of statutes and other documents have been signed by autopen, experts say. For instance, former President Barack Obama signed a national security measure via autopen while he was in France. Meyler says that if presidential pardons were to be invalidated because of an autopen signature, that could bring into question other policies that were signed by such measures. “When so much is being automated and put online, requiring some literalness in the signature really would be a step backwards,\" she says.\n\nA 2005 guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) noted that a President does not need to “personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law. Rather, the President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.” Jeffrey Crouch, a professor at American University, told Axios that pardons are final so long as they are valid. But aside from criticizing the use of the autopen, Trump also appears to be undermining President Biden’s cognitive ability at the time such pardons were issued. “He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime. Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level. The fact is, they were probably responsible for the Documents that were signed on their behalf without the knowledge or consent of the Worst President in the History of our Country, Crooked Joe Biden,” Trump wrote on Monday. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reaffirmed this position during a White House briefing on Monday, when she questioned whether Biden knew his signature was on such pardons. When asked if the White House had any evidence to support such a claim, Leavitt responded, “You're a reporter, you should find out.”\n\nThese concerns were previously flagged by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who called on the DOJ to investigate Biden’s actions on March 5. “I am demanding the DOJ investigate whether President Biden’s cognitive decline allowed unelected staff to push through radical policy without his knowing approval,” Bailey posted on X.\n\nIf Trump were to try to prosecute someone who received a presidential pardon, experts say the case would likely go to courts, where Trump’s actions are unlikely to stand. “I can't imagine the court saying that it wasn't a valid pardon because of the autopen issue,” says Meyler. “Biden made statements regarding these pardons, so it would be hard to show that they weren't a decision of the President.”",

        "title": "Here Are the Democrats Who Voted to Avert a Shutdown",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In a dramatic break with much of their party, ten Senate Democrats voted alongside Republicans on Friday to pass a six-month funding bill, averting a government shutdown with just hours to spare. The move defied a majority of the chamber's Democrats who opposed the measure, underscoring deep divisions over how to confront President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. Ahead of the vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada were among the first Democrats to publicly back the Republican funding bill, arguing that a shutdown would only strengthen Trump’s hand. They were joined by six more Democrats—Dick Durbin of Illinois, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Gary Peters of Michigan, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire—as well as Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“This was not an easy decision,” Cortez Masto, who represents a state that Trump carried last year, said in a statement. “I’m outraged by the reckless actions of President Trump, Elon Musk, and Republicans in control of Congress, so I refuse to hand them a shutdown where they would have free rein to cause more chaos and harm.” For many Democrats, the bill was more than just an unfavorable spending deal; it was a moment to push back against what they see as the Trump Administration’s creeping executive overreach. The legislation stripped away numerous funding directives, giving Trump the power to reallocate money as he saw fit without fear of judicial intervention. Read more: In Averting a Shutdown, Schumer Ignites a Rebellion The spending measure, which passed the House earlier in the week, was presented to the Senate as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. The vote in the Senate was 62-38, with 37 Democrats opposing the bill along with Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who wanted the measure to codify Trump’s cuts to foreign aid.\n\nSchumer’s decision to support the bill marked a turn from earlier in the week when he sought a 30-day extension to negotiate a bipartisan compromise. His pivot drew sharp criticism from House Democrats, who had largely united against the measure. At a retreat in Leesburg, Va. Thursday night, they made urgent appeals to their Senate counterparts, with lawmakers texting and calling senators throughout the day. “I think there is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told reporters at the retreat. “And this is not just about progressive Democrats. This is across the board. The entire party.” Prior to the vote, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator, published a list of examples of programs that the measure could allow Trump to change, such as diverting resources from combating fentanyl to funding mass deportation efforts and giving him more authority to pick which health-care or mental health programs to implement.\n\nAdding to the opposition was the bill’s treatment of Washington, D.C., which would have been forced to roll back its budget to the prior year’s levels, requiring $1.1 billion in cuts. Schumer said immediately prior to the vote that he had negotiated a deal with Senate Republicans to pass a D.C. funding fix—but the measure would still need to pass the House, which is on recess. The political implications of voting with Republicans are uncertain, but the vote ensured that the government would remain funded through September, averting furloughs for federal workers and disruptions to key services. However, the anger within the Democratic caucus is likely to linger, and could spell trouble for Schumer, who has led Senate Democrats since 2017. While no Senator has publicly called for his ouster, murmurs of discontent have grown louder, particularly among progressives who feel he has conceded too much ground to Republicans.\n\nHere are the nine Democrats, and one independent, who helped avoid a shutdown: Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) The Senate Minority Leader, who has been the chamber’s top Democrat since 2017, sent shockwaves when he announced he would back the Republican spending bill on Thursday evening. \"While the [continuing resolution] bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,” Schumer said on the Senate floor in announcing his decision. He argued that a shutdown would allow Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to accelerate efforts to dismantle federal agencies. “A shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,” he warned on Friday. “Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.” While Schumer framed his support as a necessary step to prevent Republicans from exploiting a shutdown, many in his party saw it as a surrender. His vote, combined with his leadership in pushing the bill forward, has fueled speculation about whether his position atop the Democratic Senate caucus remains tenable. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, when asked on Friday whether Schumer had “acquiesced” to Trump, Jeffries sidestepped the question: “That’s a question that is best addressed by the Senate.” Asked if the Senate needed new Democratic leadership following Schumer’s move, Jeffries replied: “Next question.”\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) Cortez Masto, who represents a state that Trump carried last year, emphasized that her decision to support the bill was not taken lightly. She cited concerns that a shutdown would provide Trump and his allies with more opportunities to erode federal institutions. “A government shutdown would be devastating for the American people,” she said in a statement, arguing that it would force thousands of Nevadans to work without pay and delay the courts which are weighing lawsuits against the Trump Administration. “The last government shutdown cost the American economy $11 billion and thousands of hardworking Americans were harmed. I cannot vote for that,” she said. As one of the more moderate Democrats in the Senate, Cortez Masto has often navigated a fine line between party unity and the political realities in Nevada, where she was narrowly re-elected to a six-year term in 2022. In voting for the bill, she broke with fellow Democratic Senator from Nevada, Jack Rosen, who voted against it. The pair rarely split on issues.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, had not publicly shared how he would vote for the Republican spending bill before he walked onto the Senate floor. Ultimately, he voted for it. In siding with Republicans and nine other Democrats, Durbin broke with fellow Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who said she was a “hell no” on the bill. In a statement posted to X, Durbin said: “There is very little about this CR that I like—but there is even less I like about shutting down the government.” He added that he was “disappointed” that Republicans would not work with his party to pass a 30-day stopgap measure that would have given Congress more time to reach a bipartisan agreement. Durbin, who is 80, has served in the Senate since 1997 and is widely expected to retire soon. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) Fetterman, who represents a state Trump won in both 2016 and 2024, has been an outspoken critic of his party’s political messaging in recent months. He was the first Democratic Senator to announce his support of the Republican spending bill, arguing that a shutdown would have given Republicans the power to dictate the terms of reopening the government.\n\n“You don’t start wars unless you have an exit plan. We had no exit plan,” Fetterman said. “That would give [Republicans] the absolute, absolute ability to decide, on their terms, how to reopen it after we shut it down, just to respond to our highly agitated left part of our party.” Fetterman, who was elected to a six-year term in 2022, has consistently positioned himself as willing to buck Democratic orthodoxy when he believes it serves working-class voters. His decision to back the bill fits within his broader critique of Democratic messaging, which he has repeatedly argued fails to resonate with key voting blocs. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) Gillibrand, who chairs the Senate Democratic campaign arm, joined her fellow New York Senator in backing the bill. While Schumer’s support carried the weight of party leadership, Gillibrand’s vote signaled that even some Democrats focused on electoral strategy saw avoiding a shutdown as the better political option.\n\nSen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) Hassan, a former governor, was once considered a vulnerable Democrat given her narrow win in 2016. Her lead in 2022, when she was re-elected to a second six-year term, was less narrow. But New Hampshire remains a competitive state for both parties. Last year, voters there backed Democrats for Congress and Kamala Harris for President, but also elected a Republican governor and expanded Republican majorities in the state legislature. Both Hassan, and New Hampshire’s other Senator, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, voted for the Republican spending bill. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) King, a Maine Independent who caucuses with Democrats, referred to the vote as “two really bad choices” in a video posted to X. He added that he voted for the spending bill “because a shutdown would open the door to unprecedented, lasting damage.” While Maine is far from a swing state, it shifted slightly to the right in the previous presidential election. King, 80, is a particularly popular figure within the state; he has served in the Senate since 2013 and was a two-term Governor before that. King won a third six-year term in the Senate in November.\n\n“The problem is with a shutdown, the President and Elon Musk and the OMB have almost unfettered discretion about what happens,” King said. “Who's essential, who's not essential, what agencies can get to work, which ones don't. And in my view, and in the view of many of my colleagues, this is a significantly greater danger to the country than the continuing resolution with all of its faults.” Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) Another Senator from a state Trump won in 2024, Peters defended his decision to vote for the Republican spending bill: “I believe Congress must do its most basic job to keep the lights on,” he said in a statement. “When the first Trump Administration shut down the government, they repeatedly broke the law,” he added. “This time, they would take it even further.” Michigan’s other Democratic senator, Elissa Slotkin, voted against the bill. Their conflicting votes highlight the difficult balancing act for Democrats in battleground states, where political calculations often involve not just party loyalty, but also the concerns of a divided electorate.\n\nEarlier this year, Peters announced he would not run for re-election when his current term ended in 2026. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) In a statement, Schatz called his vote a “difficult and close call” but said he ultimately “made the determination that a flawed bill was better than no bill at all.” “I understand people’s frustration — I share it,” he said. “But Trump and the Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, presented us with a bad choice and a worse choice. Both would produce terrible outcomes, but a shutdown would be more devastating for everyone.” Referencing the opposition to his vote from progressives, he added that Democrats “can’t let disagreements about strategy and tactics divide us.” Schatz has served in the Senate since Dec. 2012, easily winning re-election to a second full term in 2022. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) Shaheen, who announced earlier this week that she will not run for re-election in 2026, said in a statement that a government shutdown “would have hurt Granite Staters and enabled President Trump and Elon Musk to do more harm.”\n\nShe said she hoped Congress would stop relying on “never-ending continuing resolutions” like the one passed today, which she warned would only increase instability in government operations. A continuing resolution, also known as a CR, is a temporary funding measure that allows the federal government to keep operating at current spending levels when Congress fails to pass a full appropriations bill—a common theme in recent years.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the six years since I published Maid, almost every person who’s interviewed me has asked me the same question: Do I, a person who became kind of famous for writing about cleaning people’s houses, have a house cleaner myself?\n\nThe simple answer was no. But it was not because my house was already spotless. Far from it. The truth was, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it.\n\nWhen I worked as a house cleaner, I spent hours dusting rooms with objects valuable enough to pay for a weeks’ worth of groceries that I desperately needed. Everything I polished carried an invisible price tag with an obscene amount of money that had been spent. Receipts left on countertops for dry cleaning listed totals that were more than what I had paid for my car. A lot of the rooms I cleaned weren’t even used regularly, so it became my job to dust closed-off spaces bigger than the studio apartment I lived in.\n\nRead More: I Left Poverty After Writing 'Maid.' But Poverty Never Left Me\n\nI worked for nine bucks an hour, and my take-home pay was about six. While the wages from the job allowed me to barely survive, the work itself seemed so wasteful and unnecessary that I started to feel that way about myself. My clients were pleasant for the most part, but a handful of them weren’t. Regardless, a noticeable power imbalance weighed on me whenever I had to get on my hands and knees to clean the floors and toilets. To hire a house cleaner myself would not only mean putting someone in that position, where they, too, might feel worthless, but also becoming someone I used to hate.\n\nMy story is one of living in poverty, struggling to afford housing and food. I used to stay up late at night, hungry and exhausted, fighting to complete assignments for college, hoping that one day I could support my young daughter in a way that did not involve pulling hair from a bathtub drain. When my first book became a bestseller, my unexpected success skyrocketed me into a whole different class of society, namely one in which the inhabitants never had to worry if they would be able to pay the bill to heat their house. Suddenly, running out of shampoo was no longer a source of stress because I always had an extra bottle in a pantry. I had a whole shelf dedicated to toilet paper, something I used to steal from public restrooms because I couldn’t afford to buy my own.\n\nWhen my husband and I moved into our house, I told him I wanted to replace all of the cheap furniture and dishes I’d collected over the years from clearance racks and donations. When I received a large check for the Netflix series based on my book a few months after we moved in, I used it to furnish my whole house, down to the rainbow-colored Fiestaware dishes and Le Creuset cookware on display on the open shelves in the kitchen. My children’s bedrooms were the parts I enjoyed being able to furnish the most. As a house cleaner, it pained me to know how other kids my daughter’s age lived, and now I was able to provide my own with a similar space, complete with bedding that matched and bed frames made from real wood.\n\nRead More: We Didn't Have Much Money. My Daughter Still Deserved Joy\n\nBut I couldn’t enjoy it, at least not entirely. My husband and I couldn’t keep up on the mess our dogs and two daughters created. We also had a conflict of what we thought a clean house looked like. He had grown up in a house that most would call “lived-in” where mine could have been described as a sterile museum. My family didn’t see the house as a never-ending list of tasks, but everywhere I looked, I saw work that needed to be done. My bedroom was over a crawl space, in which we stored junk we no longer needed but had not found the time to sort through, and I didn’t have to see the grime and clutter to know it was there.\n\nIt was difficult to explain why this gave me such anxiety. But the constant awareness of the tasks needed to be done made it hard for me to relax, to focus, to work. I would recall the scene in Anthony Bourdain’s Kitchen Confidential where a chef would press his palm on a cook’s cutting board, which was “littered with peppercorns, spattered sauce, bits of parsley, bread crumbs and the usual flotsam and jetsam that accumulates quickly if not constantly wiped away with a moist cloth.” He’d raise his hand, showing the cook all the debris he’d picked up, and admonish: “That’s what the inside of your head looks like now. Work clean!”\n\nAnd still I resisted hiring someone to help.\n\nIt was four years before my neighbor convinced me to call a friend of hers who owned a cleaning company. Originally, I was just looking for deep clean of the whole house, but the more I talked to the owner, the better I felt about hiring cleaners to help us keep up on the regular cleaning, too. She paid her employees a living wage, and if a client canceled, she offered them the same number of hours on another job to make up for it. This had always been the most stressful part of the job for me—I relied on the income, but my clients would cancel their service on a whim, leaving me out the 30 bucks that I needed to pay my electric bill.\n\nWhen I told the owner I’d once worked for a company that forced us to clean every hard floor on our hands and knees, using two rags in a “wax on, wax off” motion from The Karate Kid, she laughed and shook her head, saying she tried to protect her employees from doing repetitive motions all day. She also mentioned that her teams used all-natural cleaners because she didn’t want her employees to breathe in chemicals. I nodded and told her about the time I’d had to stop work and go to urgent care because I’d created a mixture of the wrong cleaning agents and accidentally inhaled a toxic cloud. “They tried to force me to do a drug test, too,” I said. “I forgot about that.”\n\nA week after the walk-through, a team of four cleaners spent five hours in my house. I’d spent several days clearing the counters of piles of papers, markers, and glue sticks to make it easier to wipe the surface beneath them and picking up my youngest daughter’s room as best I could. On the kitchen counter, I left a note to say thank you, and I tipped them all 50 bucks each. When I got home, my to-do list was no longer unending. I could make some adjustments – like putting away snow globes and other knickknacks that seemed unnecessary to be on display – but they were hardly all-consuming.\n\nThe company had a weekly spot available, so now I have two cleaners come to my house for two and half hours every Wednesday. I still spend part of Tuesday in preparation, making sure there aren’t any dishes in the sink and sometimes doing an extra deep vacuum. I leave the cleaners 20 bucks each for a tip and get everyone out of the house before they get here. Though one time I was running late and talked to the first one to arrive—he’d been with the company for 10 years.\n\nLast fall my husband and I separated for four months, and my whole life was in a sort of upheaval. My 10-year-old started sleeping with me at night, filling my bed with her favorite blankets and stuffed animals. Between work and caring for the kids, animals, and house on my own, there wasn’t much left for me. But one day I walked into my bedroom and saw the beautiful way the cleaners had made my bed and arranged all the stuffed animals. It made me smile, then brought tears to my eyes. It was the first time someone had made a lot of effort to take care of me in weeks.\n\nI went to the living room and, for once, I didn’t feel the urge to scrub the whole place down. The work was done. I could breathe.\n\nWhen I cleaned houses, I had just a few clients I truly felt I was helping. It’s only now that I’m a client myself that I can see the value of the work I did at my former job. I wonder how many of my clients were able to take a full, relaxing breath on the days I had been in their homes. I bet it was all of them. All these years later, aware of the immense respect and gratitude I have for the hardworking people who clean my house, I am able to better appreciate the person I was back then and be proud of the work she did to take care of others.\n\nMaybe the work I did was not actually wasteful and unnecessary after all. Maybe I wasn’t either.",

        "title": "Why Canada Is Giving Mark Carney a Shot",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the coming days, Mark Carney will be sworn in as the 24th Prime Minister of Canada, a political novice stepping onto the ice at a moment of maximum peril, both for his party and his country. Carney, who many years ago was the backup goalie for Harvard’s hockey team, will find himself in front of the net for a game that he can’t afford to lose. Donald Trump is threatening to use economic force to annex Canada, and Canadians are expected to go to the polls within weeks to decide who will guard the net—Carney or Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, whose populist bombast is unusually intense for Canadian politics.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt would be a daunting task for any politician, let alone a rookie. Carney has never held elected office, but Canada’s desperate Liberals gave him a strong mandate to lead their party on Sunday, with 86% of the vote on the first ballot. That decisive vote was based wholly on the strength of Carney’s CV, which Immigration Minister Marc Miller points out is noteworthy. Asking about Carney’s CV is “like asking someone whether War and Peace is a good book,” says Miller, who backed him to take over from Justin Trudeau. “It’s a f***ing good book.” Read More: How Canada Fell Out of Love With Trudeau Trudeau, who was a high-school teacher before he was elected to Parliament, had the thinnest CV of any Prime Minister in Canadian history. He swept to office with a majority government in 2015 based on his good looks, boundless energy on the campaign trail, and family name—he is the son of former Prime Minister and Liberal icon Pierre Trudeau.\n\nCarney could hardly be more different. He lacks Trudeau’s gift for working a crowd, is not notably dashing, and his father was a high-school principal in Fort Smith, a town of 2,000 people in Canada’s far north. Where Trudeau has always been seen as a charismatic lightweight, Carney is a nose-to-the-grindstone type. He worked his way to Harvard, then Oxford University, then Goldman Sachs, then the governorship of first the Bank of Canada—where he drew global admiration for his management of the 2008 financial crisis—and then the Bank of England, where he kept Britain liquid after the U.K. voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Carney’s cool was tested by the chaotic Brexit years, and he made lifelong enemies among the Brexiteers. But the man who gave him the job, George Osborne, who was finance minister under Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, thinks he did a splendid job. Osborne recently told the CBC that Carney has the technical knowledge and the “street smarts” to cope with the trade war that Trump has imposed on Canada.\n\n“I think if I was sending someone into bat for Canada, I’d want Mark Carney,” he said. “The Canadian with the most international experience in the whole of Canada is Mark Carney.” Canada’s Liberals hope his experience managing crises will be enough to convince voters to re-elect them in an election expected this spring. Canadians have watched, horrified, as Trump has repeatedly threatened to bring in 25% tariffs—which could kill up to 600,000 jobs in Canada—unless Canada agrees to become the 51st state. Trump has twice ordered tariffs, then pulled back at the last moment. Some went into effect on Tuesday, although he paused others temporarily after stock markets fell and the Big Three automakers pleaded for time. Canadians at first reacted to tariffs with icy fear, but that has hardened into anger and resolve. They repeatedly booed the Star Spangled Banner at hockey and basketball games, have taken bourbon off the shelves, cancelled Florida vacations, and boycotted American produce.\n\nAfter Trump’s first tariff threats, Trudeau reacted by trying to shuffle Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland out of cabinet to make way for Carney. She quit instead, and Trudeau was forced to resign, which led to the succession race that Carney won on Sunday. The Trump factor disrupted the carefully laid plans of Poilievre, who had looked sure to win the next election. For two and half years, Poilievre had built momentum as the agent of change. A pugnacious critic with an unerring instinct for finding his opponent’s weakness, he harnessed widespread anger over the cost-of-living crisis, record immigration, and one of the world’s worst housing crises, promising a great reckoning for Trudeau’s “woke” policies. But Poilievre, who took over his party by harnessing the anger of the truckers’ protest against vaccine mandates, borrowed techniques and messages from the MAGA movement, and that now makes him vulnerable.\n\nWhen Trump started attacking Canada, and Trudeau announced his resignation, the Liberals surged in the polls. The upcoming election now looks like a dead heat. Since candidates usually get a boost coming out of a leadership convention, the Conservatives will start out as the underdogs, a shocking turnaround after two years where they were leading by 20 points and the Liberals faced electoral oblivion. Underneath the horse-race numbers, there is more bad news for the Conservatives. Polling shows that voters are more likely to trust Carney than Poilievre to manage Trump—perhaps because part of Poilievre’s base is pro-Trump. That doesn’t mean, though, that Carney is sure to win. Exhaustion with the Liberals is profound after almost a decade in power. On other issues—particularly climate and resource development—Carney will face challenges. He has a long record of advocating for emission reductions in financial markets—he was a U.N. climate envoy—which may make it hard for him to appeal to voters who have had enough of Liberal restrictions on oil and gas production, especially now that Canadians are wishing they had more pipelines to tidewater so that they could tell Trump where to put his tariffs.\n\nRead More: How Canada Got Hooked on the U.S. Economy And Carney’s win was all but a coronation. As when Kamala Harris took over from Joe Biden, there was not time enough for a proper contest to test potential replacements for Trudeau. The Liberal leadership race was compressed, and Carney was far ahead all along, so his opponents were not motivated to challenge him too much. Freeland, who was once Trudeau’s trusted right hand, looks like she wants to be on Carney’s team. The abbreviated race means Carney is untested and may be prone to rookie mistakes. He struggled to explain a decision to move the headquarters of Brookfield Asset Management, where he was chair, from Toronto to New York. It was not a fatal mistake, but a sign that, like many from business who enter politics—he has not calibrated for the demands of public office. He showed some charm when he teased his leadership announcement on The Daily Show in January, but he is not an electric speaker, speaks French like a bureaucrat, and has little experience debating.\n\nCarney often says he is not a politician, contrasting himself with Poilievre, who has never done anything else. But it may be hard for a technocrat and multi-millionaire to present himself as an outsider and a change agent. Even those on his team acknowledge some trepidation.\n\n“It's hard to go from a minister to Prime Minister,” says Miller. “It's hard to go from just a backbencher to Prime Minister. It's really hard to go from politically nothing to Prime Minister.”\n\nBut the Liberals have no backup goalie, and the puck is about to drop.",

        "title": "Michelle Zauner Stares Down the Darkness",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Michelle Zauner wants to set the record straight: She is not trying to reclaim the label “sad girl music.” Since announcing the title of her highly anticipated fourth studio album, For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), the author, director, and front woman of indie-pop band Japanese Breakfast has been surprised to see how divisive the title has become, and the assumptions it’s given way to. Some thought she was writing a collection of sad breakup songs; others that she was taking ownership of a label that has previously been wielded with the intent to belittle or insult.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“I think [the album title] was a little bit tongue-in-cheek,” Zauner says with a chuckle over Zoom in early February. “And it was maybe taken very literally.” “Sad girl music” is a fraught subject, and Zauner chooses her words carefully. “I don’t want to get into trouble,” she says, explaining that a lot of brilliant women songwriters get unfairly punted into that category. And it’s true: the music industry and the internet have made a nasty habit of reducing songwriting by women that deals with complex emotions in this way—Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski, and Lana Del Rey have had to fend off these degrading designations for years.\n\nZauner, though, is interested to see what people will say once they’ve had a listen to the project in its entirety. With the album due March 21, Zauner, 35, finds herself in a constant state of “caring, then not caring, and then pretending to care.” Her mood matches the weather outside our windows: “I’m a winter person in the sense that I feel like I must suffer through something to enjoy the coming season,” she says and laughs heartily. The stakes feel high after her past few years. For Melancholy Brunettes arrives four years after Zauner’s rise from indie-music darling to literary heavyweight with the release of her wildly successful, gut-punching memoir Crying in H Mart, which explored her Korean American identity and her relationship with her late mother Chongmi, who died of cancer in 2014. Written in arresting, empathetic prose, it became an instant New York Times best seller and is currently in its 39th printing.\n\nRead More: Michelle Zauner Is on the 2022 TIME 100 List Zauner followed up Crying in H Mart with Japanese Breakfast’s third studio album, Jubilee. Unlike the book, the album took a sharp turn away from grief into cathartic joy, blending dreamy synth-pop chords with shoe-gaze sensibilities. It was equally met with critical success, earning the group nominations for Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Album at the 2022 Grammys. For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), though, is worlds away from the sonic landscape of Jubilee. It’s not quite in the sphere of Crying in H Mart, either. Here, Zauner is exploring something bleaker—crueler and more punishing. She’s trying to see what darkness, of all different kinds, looks like when you stare it right in the face. When I ask what comes to mind when Zauner thinks of melancholy brunettes, she excitedly whips out her phone to rattle off some references: Paintings like L’Absinthe by Edgar Degas, Tired by Ramón Casas, and The Wedding Dress by Frederick Elwell—all interpretations of women experiencing massive despair—were hugely informative to the record. They were especially important to the album art, which sees Zauner looking like a gothic, Brontëesque character, face down on a table surrounded by a plentiful feast. “I like the idea of being someone just collapsed on a table, surrounded by a wealth of goods. Like a spoiled prince or something,” she explains.\n\nWhen Zauner began writing For Melancholy Brunettes in the winter of 2022, she was clear that she wanted to do something from a more introspective place. She wanted to write songs that were also more guitar-focused, compared to Jubilee’s lush horns and slinky synths, and teamed up with producer Blake Mills (who, among his vast repertoire of acts, has worked with other virtuosic rock acts like Fiona Apple, Perfume Genius, and Alabama Shakes) to record the album at Sound City in Los Angeles—making it the band’s first proper studio release after working on their first three records with friends in makeshift recording studios. As she began piecing the songs together, Zauner was also reading—a lot. She wanted to explore how the concept of melancholy has evolved in stories of love and longing, society and familial relationships over time. She worked her way from European Romanticism to Greek mythology before turning to Gothic Romance classics like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and Frankenstein, and even modernist staples like The Magic Mountain by German author Thomas Mann, which is her husband and fellow bandmate Peter Bradley’s favorite book and directly inspired a song on the album.\n\nShe also became increasingly fascinated with works “that could be categorized as part of the incel canon,” Zauner says—books that the mostly male subculture of self-described “involuntary celibates” has glorified for their depiction of loneliness and manhood—think American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis and Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Zauner hoped to better understand why this type of “confused masculinity” and Joker-like anger and loneliness emerges; how these aggrieved and occasionally violent men process the world. “If I look back at my very early work, it’s always been [there]—this fear of men,” she says. “There is this disappointment and fear of men, and these creepy stories—like an ominous thing has happened or is about to happen—that threads the songs together.”\n\nZauner, second from right, performs with Japanese Breakfast Todd Owyoung—NBC/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, listening to the new album feels not unlike you’re Cathy (or Heathcliff) staring at the misty English moors, as impending doom envelops you from all angles: On “Honey Water,” a woman finds herself in a marriage to a slimy, unfaithful man, and equates him to a thirsty bug. On “Mega Circuit,” a lustful spectator watches a gang of incels meander around over a feverish, sinister guitar shuffle. On “Little Girl,” perhaps one of the most devastating ballads on the record, a father, urinating in a corner of a lonely hotel room, wonders how he became estranged from his daughter. (“Seven years of running at this breakneck speed/ Convalescing cheaply far abroad/ Dreaming of a daughter who won’t speak to me/ Running for her father coming home.”) Dramatic as they may seem, these sentiments are strikingly relatable—feelings of yearning and amorphous despair on an album releasing in the middle of a public-health crisis of loneliness.\n\nThe lyrics, the storytelling, the sparse, meticulous melodies—it’s all so beautifully punishing, and that is exactly the point. After her mom died, Zauner says, she “became very work-obsessed.” While work was a grounding force, it came at a cost: “I kind of lost track of any form of self-care or personal life, or family and friends.” Following the release of Crying in H Mart and then Jubilee (and a much-needed sabbatical in Korea), Zauner found herself thinking about what it means to be a creative working woman in her mid-30s—the price one pays for their ambitions. It was playing on Zauner’s mind a lot as she was making For Melancholy Brunettes, especially when she thought about balancing her work with expanding her family. “There is this anticipatory grief about wanting to become a mother and having to reckon with the creative loss that that will usher in,” Zauner says. “I was thinking about how much I’ve excused men for poor behavior because of their positions of power and the work that they’ve had to do to provide for their family.” Now, as Zauner has grown into her creative career, she questions the elusive balancing act between the “narcissism that comes with being an artist and [the desire to be] a good human being.”\n\nIt’s what drew her to write the album’s lead single, “Orlando in Love.” Inspired by John Cheever’s nod to Orlando Innamorato, an unfinished epic poem by the Renaissance poet Matteo Maria Boiardo, the song is a story about “a foolish, romantic guy” who succumbs to a siren’s call, and in some ways, Zauner’s personal reflection on success. “You’re pursuing your dreams in a very foolhardy way, and sometimes you’re punished for just how straight you’re going with it,” she says. “Like, if you go too far in your ambitions, it likely will not end well.” The 2025 Grammys happened a week before Zauner and I spoke, and the internet was still buzzing not only from Beyoncé’s finally winning Album of the Year, but another artist who unequivocally spoke their mind that night: Chappell Roan. Roan, who received the Grammy for Best New Artist, got up to the podium and called out the record industry for not supporting emerging artists with necessities like a livable wage and health insurance. When Zauner heard this, she immediately took to X to congratulate Roan, writing, “f-ck ya Chappell!!!!!” That got her in a bit of trouble: some people interpreted “ya” to mean an insulting “you” instead of an enthusiastic “yes.” Zauner couldn’t believe it.\n\nRead More: Leave Chappell Roan Alone\n\n“Let the record show that I thought it was amazing, and I think it’s so ridiculous how much crap she has to endure for all of the good that she’s putting into the world. She inspires me to be a more outspoken, braver artist,” Zauner says. Having been nominated in the same category, she finds it a bit funny that these award shows so aggressively avoid naming the problems that plague the same industry they are celebrating. But Roan, she says, “very eloquently and very courageously said exactly what the problem is.”\n\nPerhaps that’s what For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women) is trying to do, too. Naming the problem—and hoping that despite the scars, the battle wounds, the punishment, and the castigations, we’ll all come out the other end into the light.",

        "content": "The standoff at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue was not much of a spectacle. On the first day of February, a handful of men working for Elon Musk had come to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a few blocks from the White House, demanding full access to its headquarters. The agency’s staff refused. No guns were drawn. No punches thrown. Nobody involved the police. But in these early days of the Trump Administration, perhaps no other scene revealed more clearly the forces reshaping America’s government.\n\nOn one side stood an institution with a 64-year history, a $35 billion budget, and a mission enshrined in federal law. On the other stood Musk’s political wrecking crew. They identified themselves as members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a collection of temporary staffers with no charter, no website, and no clear legal authority. Its power derives from Musk, the wealthiest person on the planet, who has been deputized to dismantle vast swaths of the federal bureaucracy—slashing budgets, gutting the civil service, and stripping independent agencies of the ability to impede the President’s objectives.\n\nUSAID leadership had allowed Musk’s team, a group of his young and eager followers, to spend several days inside their headquarters at the end of January. “The DOGE kids,” as some of the staffers called them in private, walked the halls with clipboards in their hands, examining desks and questioning managers, according to several USAID officials who described the events to TIME. But as the weekend arrived, their demands—including access to sensitive facilities designed to store classified information—went too far for the agency’s heads of security. The men from DOGE threatened to call the U.S. Marshals and have them clear the building. They also informed Musk about the problem. “USAID is a criminal organization,” Musk wrote to his 215 million followers on his social media platform, X, soon after. “Time for it to die.”\n\nThe cause of Musk’s crusade remained unclear. But regardless of the reason, by the following morning, an agency that annually disburses tens of billions of dollars across the globe, fighting famine and disease and bringing clean water to millions, had mostly ceased to function. Within a week, nearly all its staff were placed on leave, its offices around the world shut down.\n\nPhoto-Illustration by TIME (Source Photos: Chip Somodevilla—Getty Images; Anna Moneymaker—Getty Images)\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nEvery other government bureau got the message loud and clear. No single private citizen, certainly not one whose wealth and web of businesses are directly subject to the oversight of federal authorities, has wielded such power over the machinery of the U.S. government. So far, Musk appears accountable to no one but President Trump, who handed his campaign benefactor a sweeping mandate to bring the government in line with his agenda. DOGE directed all of TIME’s questions about its work to the White House, which declined to comment.\n\nRead More: How Elon Musk Became a Kingmaker.\n\nAlready, the DOGE team has taken over the U.S. Digital Service and established a beachhead within the federal human-resources department, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Education Department is on edge, fearing a self-decapitation mandate is in the offing. Few agencies seem safe. Musk has shown that he will tolerate no opposition, no matter how justified. Days before the drama at USAID, a Treasury official refused DOGE access to the U.S. federal payment system. The official was forced to retire, and the newly appointed Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, gave DOGE the access it demanded. The Administration agreed on Feb. 5 to restrict that access, at least temporarily, after a group of past and present employees sued.\n\nThese are just the first ripples in a massive antigovernment wave. Budgets will be hacked. Valuable programs will be eliminated. Career civil servants will be purged, replaced with political appointees whose primary qualification is apparent fealty to the President. This is the course the electorate chose. And to many, the idea of one of the world’s most accomplished entrepreneurs attacking a sprawling, sclerotic federal bureaucracy with the same velocity and determination he brought to his car startup or rocket company is cause for celebration, not alarm. “The federal government is so big that there are surely significant opportunities for saving and efficiency,” says Robert Doar, president of the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. “The fact that the President and his team is giving this a lot of attention is a good thing.”\n\nBut a public backlash may be growing to Musk’s mission, and far more is at stake than the size of the federal balance sheet, the head count at agencies inside the Beltway, or the dangers of one unelected man possessing such unconstrained power. Soon Americans are going to learn where they interact with the federal government in ways they didn’t realize or took for granted. Companies that export tech products to China may no longer have State or Commerce Department employees available to explain, for free, how to avoid violating criminal law. Farmers in the Midwest may soon find USAID-funded buyers no longer paying for sacks of flour to send to refugee camps. Around the world, millions of people who depend on the U.S. for food, medicine, and shelter are suddenly on their own.\n\nRead More: Why TIME Chose Musk As 2021 Person of the Year.\n\nFor now, millions of government workers find themselves at Musk’s mercy. One described her team at the Department of Homeland Security assuming a “defensive crouch” as they awaited a visit from the DOGE. For an inkling of their fate, she added, her colleagues had turned to a book called Character Limit, which chronicles the way Musk took over Twitter two years ago and fired 80% of its staff, often with chaotic and lasting results.\n\nThe similarities to his assault on the bureaucracy have been uncanny. On Jan. 28, millions of civil servants across government received an email offering them eight months’ pay in exchange for their resignation. Musk had proposed much the same deal to Twitter’s employees two years earlier. He even used the same subject line: “Fork in the road.”\n\nNone of this came without warning. Among Musk’s friends in Silicon Valley, many understood his takeover of Twitter as preparation for a greater cause. “The mood is that hopefully Musk can do the same thing with the U.S. government,” one told TIME in November. Veterans of Trump’s first Administration likewise laid out their plans long before the elections, publishing a 900-page report known as Project 2025. One of its lead authors, Russell Vought, said in a speech two years ago that he wanted civil servants to be “traumatically affected” by the purge he envisioned. “We want their funding to be shut,” he said. “We want to put them in trauma.”\n\nRussell Vought, Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, at a confirmation hearing on Jan. 15. Andrew Harnik—Getty Images\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump swore he had nothing to do with the plan. “It was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that,” he told TIME in November. “Some things I vehemently disagreed with.” But once in office, he picked Vought to be in charge of the White House Office of Management and Budget, which now works closely with Musk to enact crucial parts of Project 2025. So far, the frenetic opening moves of the Trump presidency have tracked nearly two-thirds of its prescriptions, according to a TIME analysis.\n\nMusk never hid his intentions. Two weeks after the election, he co-wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal that promised DOGE would help Trump “hire a lean team of small-government crusaders,” who would work to bring “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.” That recruitment drive began soon after the elections, drawing from Musk’s acolytes in Silicon Valley, some barely out of college, and priming them to fan out across Washington.\n\nRead More: Inside Elon Musk's Struggle For the Future of AI.\n\nThe man Musk put in charge of staffing at DOGE was an aerospace engineer named Steve Davis, who previously led his cost-cutting efforts at Twitter. In late December, as the presidential transition unfolded inside the White House, Davis took part in a series of meetings with members of the Biden Administration. The Democratic staffers noted his fixation with an obscure branch of the White House called the U.S. Digital Service. Davis wanted to know how it operated, who it reported to, and what it could access.\n\nCreated in 2014, the USDS works with federal agencies to improve computer systems and databases. It houses a map of the government’s technology infrastructure and has contact points for the technology officer at nearly every federal agency. That made it the perfect place to host the DOGE. If Musk wanted to wither the limbs of the federal government, the USDS provided the veins that would let the poison flow.\n\nThe empowerment of USDS started on Inauguration Day. One of Trump’s first Executive Orders renamed it “the United States DOGE Service,” neatly preserving the office’s acronym. The order also ensured that the new entity would report directly to the White House chief of staff. Since then, the office has set up shop inside the Departments of State and Treasury. It began accessing personnel computer systems, firing contractors, and blocking payments on their contracts.\n\nMusk also sent a team to OPM. The office holds records on 2.1 million workers, the email address for nearly every federal employee, and tracks $59 billion per year in federal health care premiums and $88 billion per year in payments to federal retirees. The mass buyout offer to government employees originated from within Musk’s team at OPM, according to a source familiar with those actions. (Both DOGE and the White House declined to comment.)\n\nRead More: As Musk's DOGE Targets Federal Data, This Obscure Office Is at the Center\n\nNext, the DOGE team set to starving OPM itself. Brian Bjelde, who recently worked as vice president of human resources at Musk’s aerospace firm, told career supervisors at OPM that the “target” was to slash 70% of its staff, a move that would hobble its health care benefits and retirement-planning teams, says a current OPM official. Some senior leaders at OPM have been locked out of key databases, the official says, and political appointees have access to systems, including the Enterprise Human Resources Integration, without standard safeguard procedures designed to keep such information private. That system includes information like pay grades, length of service, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and home addresses.\n\nDays after Trump took office, the White House ordered a freeze on federal spending—from foreign aid to public-health programs, and everything in between. It would be lifted, the Administration said, as agencies fell in line with the President’s agenda: cracking down on immigration, ending diversity efforts, and stopping investments that reduce the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Facing a court’s action, the White House rolled back the order.\n\nA protest outside the U.S. Treasury building in Washington, D.C., on Feb 4. Stefani Reynolds—Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk’s downsizing pressed ahead, and Trump continued to give his blessing. “Elon can’t do—and won’t do—anything without our approval,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Feb. 4. “We’ll give him the approval where appropriate,” he added. “Where not appropriate, we won’t.” Some took it as a sign that Trump might rein in his attack dog. But civil servants are not waiting around for that to happen. In Northern Virginia, home to tens of thousands of workers on the federal payroll and military service members, the typical town-hall meeting in the town of Leesburg attracts a few dozen people. Hundreds gathered on the night Musk shut down USAID. “We’re hearing bizarre stories,” says Representative Suhas Subramanyam, the local Democratic Congressman who spoke at the event. His office has been flooded with workers describing DOGE’s takeover, and he instructed his staff to log their testimony and assist whistle-blowers. Much of what they witnessed is “simply illegal,” Subramanyam insists to TIME. “We’re almost being tested and dared to sue or investigate.”\n\nRead More: Across Pennsylvania, Musk Deploys His Fame and Fortune For Trump.\n\nSome lawsuits have worked. The White House complied with court orders blocking its attempt to freeze trillions of dollars in federal spending. A judge’s ruling on Feb. 6 delayed the deadline for the buyout offer to government employees. Unions have filed suits related to DOGE on behalf of federal workers. Even Musk’s usual admirers have warned he is overreaching. “The lawsuits are already flying,” a Feb. 4 Wall Street Journal editorial noted, “and courts will derail Mr. Musk’s project before it even gets off the ground if he isn’t careful.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Musk’s assault on the bureaucracy has set up a battle with Democrats that could determine the future of the government and the balance of power within it. “We don’t have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk,” Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin told a crowd outside USAID on the afternoon of Feb. 3, while the men from DOGE tried to impose their demands inside.\n\nRaskin was right. But the agency staffers listening to him on Pennsylvania Avenue, unsure of whether they still had a job, could not tell how much power Musk had acquired, and whether he would bend the other branches of government to his will. One staffer seemed especially skeptical. Yes, she told TIME, the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse. But Musk had shown his power to yank it away.\n\n“There’s only so much Democrats can do,” she said, not wanting to give her name lest it attract more attention from DOGE. Her official email account had been shut down, and she could no longer access her desk at the agency. Like thousands of her colleagues, and millions of Americans, she was left to watch Musk’s moves play out, wondering how far he would go, and what, if anything, could stop him. —With reporting by Eric Cortellessa, Philip Elliott, Nik Popli, and Tessa Berenson Rogers/Washington",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The three gold medals that sprinter Gabby Thomas won at the Paris Olympics last summer are currently resting in what is, she says, their proper place: her sock drawer. She’s stuck her silver and bronze from Tokyo in there too.\n\nThomas, 28, is in no rush to build any sort of living-room shrine to her athletic accomplishments. “The medals are truly just objects for me,” she says. “I don't look at them and genuinely feel like, ‘Oh my God, those are so cool.’” One day, she may enjoy staring at all that precious metal, as a reminder of past glories. But now is not that time. “I genuinely feel like I'm not done yet,” says Thomas. “I’m still on my journey. I'm still in that process. I have so many more to come.”\n\nPlus, her life is more than mere medals. When her track career comes to a close, Thomas has designs on leading a nonprofit organization like Austin’s Volunteer Healthcare Clinic, where she has helped manage fellow workers, interacted with patients—many of whom are uninsured and live in underserved Latino communities—and arranged for one of her sponsors, New Balance, to donate shoes. “What I do now only fuels that thought,” says Thomas, who wrote her master’s thesis at the University of Texas about racial disparities in sleep epidemiology, after majoring in neurobiology and global health as a Harvard undergrad. “We see the difference that we make in the community. We are, in fact, bridging that racial health disparity gap, which is really important to me.”\n\nOne woman who received new footwear at the clinic last spring was moved to tears and shared with Thomas that she was going through some personal turmoil. “It felt like somebody was looking out for her,” says Thomas. “You feel alone and you're in a dark place, and something so small can make a big difference.”\n\nAfter the Paris Olympics, where Thomas won the 200 m and pair of relay golds in the 4x100 and 4x400, she headlined Athlos NYC, a female-only track event backed by Reddit co-founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian. Athlos doled out a record prize purse, including $60,000 for the winner of each of the six sprint and middle-distance races. Thomas finished second in the 200 m. Megan Thee Stallion provided the post-race entertainment. “It was a great cultural moment for us,” says Thomas. “Because when you actually look at who's running track and field, most of us are Black women. And we had an event that really celebrated that.”\n\nOver these past few months, Thomas has also appeared on the cover of Vogue, snapped a picture with Rihanna at an awards show, attended Fashion Week, and served as grand marshal of the New York City Marathon. Now she’s training for the upcoming season, which includes the debut of Grand Slam Track, a new league founded by legendary sprinter Michael Johnson, likely another Athlos event, and world championships, where she’ll aim to win her first individual gold. These commitments have forced her to step away from her management role at the clinic, although she still regularly checks in on patients.\n\nGoing into the next Olympic cycle, Thomas has started strong off the blocks. “The gold medals, while they do add pressure, have given me a lot of confidence, have truly showed me what I'm capable of,” says Thomas. “So I'm definitely looking forward to the next couple of years. The fact that LA 2028 is in America, in my home country, I just don't think it could be wrapped more beautifully for me.”",

        "title": "Why Imposter Syndrome Isn’t a Personal Flaw",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Dunn, a former practicing attorney, professor, and nonprofit executive, is a consultant focusing on systemic equity, diversity, and inclusion. She is the author of Qualified: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work\n\nThe term “imposter syndrome” has become a cultural shorthand for self-doubt. We’re told it’s something to fix within ourselves: a nagging belief that we’re unqualified or unworthy, even when all evidence points to the contrary. Yet for many women—and especially women of color—this framing misses the mark entirely.\n\nIn reality, what’s labeled as imposter syndrome in the workplace is often a misdiagnosis—a symptom of systemic inequities. It’s a response to environments steeped in bias, exclusion, and relentless scrutiny of the competence of women, Black professionals, and other people of color, a practice known as “competency checking.” Competency checking—whether intentional or unconscious—undermines those who challenge traditional norms of leadership and success. Imposter syndrome, however, masquerades as an internal failing, leading women to pathologize themselves rather than confront the systems perpetuating their struggles.\n\nThis misidentification was never clearer to me than during a conversation with a prospective client—a white woman—about a keynote speech on imposter syndrome. I explained my view: imposter syndrome is a catch-all term that obscures the real culprits—sexism, racism, and white supremacy. It can set up women to blame themselves for what is actually persistent, systemic competency checking.\n\nThe woman was visibly taken aback. She said that none of the consultants she had spoken with framed the issue this way, and one consultant had even claimed that “Everyone has imposter syndrome, and anyone who says they don’t is a liar or a narcissist.” This reductive and harmful framing shocked me. Imposter syndrome isn’t recognized as a psychiatric disorder; it’s not listed in the DSM-5 or the International Classification of Diseases. Yet the notion that everyone suffers from it has become pervasive.\n\nRead More: Yes, Impostor Syndrome Is Real. Here’s How to Deal With It\n\nI explained to her that feelings of self-doubt and uncertainty are part of being human. But these feelings differ from the systemic barriers and biases that create environments where women—and especially women of color—are made to feel unworthy. Black women, for instance, often reject the idea that they are imposters. Instead, they focus on the challenges of working within systems not designed for their success. This difference in perception can create friction with white women, who may frame these struggles through a lens of personal failings, a narrative that imposter syndrome encourages.\n\nCiting global inclusion strategist Ruchika Malhotra and writer Jodi-Ann Burey’s Harvard Business Review article “Stop Telling Women They Have Imposter Syndrome,” I emphasized that self-doubt often reflects a rational response to systemic bias. As Malhotra and Burey put it, “Impostor syndrome directs our view toward fixing women at work instead of fixing the places where women work.”\n\nUnmasking the villain\n\nI often use a metaphor inspired by Scooby-Doo to explain this dynamic. In every episode, Scooby and the gang unmask a ghostly villain, revealing it to be someone using fear to hide their schemes. Imposter syndrome is a similar mask, obscuring systemic inequities that fuel self-doubt. Once the mask is removed, the real question is: How did we get here, and why do so many—particularly white women—believe the ghost is real?\n\nThe origins of the term “impostor phenomenon,” coined in 1978, offer clues. Psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes described the experiences of 178 predominantly white, upper-middle-class women who felt intellectually fraudulent despite their achievements. The study framed their feelings as internal failings rather than responses to external pressures, such as patriarchy and white supremacy, which drive perfectionism. It overlooked the realities of sexism, classism, and racism—and the complex interplay of these forces.\n\nIf the study had included women of color, working-class white women, or others excluded from its narrow lens, it might have painted a different picture. Take Crystal Lee Sutton, the real-life inspiration for the movie Norma Rae. In 1978, when Sutton stopped her work and famously stood up on a table in the mill to protest the impact of unchecked capitalism, sexism, and racism on the poor and working-class women who worked there, she didn’t hold up a sign saying she felt like an imposter; she held up a sign that said “UNION.”\n\nThere must have been days when Sutton felt uncertain or even like a fraud—not because of a clinical disorder but because she was human. Yet she identified the real culprit: The systemic exploitation of working poor women. Sutton understood that change required building a coalition of white and Black women to challenge the status quo. She correctly identified the external factors—and fought back with the right medicine: solidarity.\n\nReimagining the solution\n\nTo move beyond imposter syndrome, we must reframe it as a systemic issue rather than an individual failing. Workplaces must become environments where microaggressions, implicit bias, and inequitable opportunities are actively dismantled. Women must recognize that self-doubt often reflects competency checking, not their actual abilities.\n\nSolidarity is crucial. Women of all backgrounds must come together to challenge the status quo, building coalitions that center the experiences of the most marginalized. Organizations, too, must reassess how they evaluate candidates for hiring and promotion: Are hidden biases baked into the criteria used to measure competence? And how do these biases disproportionately affect women and people of color?\n\nMoving toward collective action\n\nImposter syndrome thrives in isolation, convincing women that they alone are flawed. But the solution lies in collective action. By addressing the systemic roots of competency checking, we can create workplaces where self-doubt doesn’t hinder potential, and no one is punished for their confidence or ambition.\n\nWhite women must recognize that their successes and burdens are intertwined with those of women of color. The fight against competency checking isn’t just about individual self-improvement; it’s a call to dismantle the systems of oppression that undermine all women in the workplace.\n\nIn the wake of the great DEI surge of 2020–2021 and the current collapse and retreat from creating more equitable workplaces, women of color—and particularly Black women—find themselves under attack, and in desperate need of support from true allies. To move forward, we must unmask the real villains and build a future grounded in solidarity, equity, and shared power.\n\nFrom the book QUALIFIED: How Competency Checking and Race Collide at Work by Shari Dunn.

        "content": "Earlier this week, the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) head, Lee Zeldin announced 31 actions aimed at rolling back a number of significant environmental regulations—including reconsidering restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, rolling back vehicle emission standards aimed at accelerating the transition to EVs, and pushing to challenge a 2009 “endangerment finding” that determined greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane are a threat to public health.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe agency called it the “greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.” Legal experts say it's a marked departure from the agency’s historic purpose to protect human health and the environment. “It's an all out assault on climate regulation and environmental and public health protections,” says Michael Burger, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. However, the announcement does not mean that the EPA has legal authority to institute the proposed rollbacks, experts say. “It is not within the authority of an agency to take action or to push through decisions that are directly and diametrically opposed to its mandate and the reason it was created,” says Nikki Reisch, director of Climate and Energy at the Center for International Environmental Law. While each administration has flexibility in how they enforce agency regulations, the process of outright repealing regulations is more complicated, Reisch notes. “Merely making these pronouncements from up high does not change the law,” she says. “It doesn't change the statutes that exist to protect clean air and clean water, and to protect the health of people throughout this country.”\n\nRead more: Here Are All of Trump’s Major Moves to Dismantle Climate Action In order to roll back a rule or regulation, the EPA would have to go through a process defined in the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires federal agencies to publish notices of proposed and final rules, and provide plenty of opportunity for the public to comment on those proposed changes. “One of the signature and most important features of the process is that the agency has to make clear what it intends or proposes to do and why,” says Reisch. “It can't just disregard these and steamroll ahead with what it intended, without explaining how it has considered and addressed those comments and why it is or isn't taking them into account. And that can be a really important opportunity for the public to send a strong signal to an agency that something matters.” As part of the process, the agency would have to back its proposal with scientific evidence. Among the most significant changes the agency has proposed is a reconsideration of a 2009 finding that determined greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health—a finding that laid the foundation for much of the work the EPA has been able to do in the last 15 years.\n\nTo undo the finding, the agency would have to show that the scientific evidence is incorrect—disproving a globally accepted fact. Pollutants from greenhouse gasses reduce air quality, which increases individual risk for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. “They have to [prove] the previous determination, that greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change and endanger public health and welfare, was wrong or was not based on sufficient scientific evidence. And there's no basis for that. The science is quite clear, and the consensus is global,” says Burger. Read more: How Trump Is Trying to Undo the Inflation Reduction Act Experts say that any attempted rollbacks will likely be litigated, and, given the scientific evidence against the agency’s proposals, courts are not likely to rule in the administration’s favor. But the process could take time. Meanwhile, the door is open for the administration—or corporate allies—to act in their own self interests.\n\n“It might take some months or even a year or two to get this litigated, and maybe that's what they're counting on,” says Daniel Esty, an environmental law professor at Yale University. “By ignoring [prior regulations] during the time that there's a challenge underway, they can get most of what they want.”\n\nCorrection, March 17\n\nThe original version of this story mischaracterized the power of federal agencies. They are able to roll back rules and regulations, but not statutes.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, killing at least 404 Palestinians, including women and children, according to hospital officials. The surprise bombardment shattered a ceasefire in place since January and threatened to fully reignite the 17-month-old war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes after Hamas refused Israeli demands to change the ceasefire agreement. Officials said the operation was open-ended and was expected to expand. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel's actions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza, including much of the northern town of Beit Hanoun and other communities further south, and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations. “Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” Netanyahu’s office said. The attack during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan could resume a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised questions about the fate of the roughly two dozen Israeli hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive. A senior Hamas official said Netanyahu’s decision to return to war amounts to a “death sentence” for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to try and save his far-right governing coalition and called on mediators to “reveal facts” on who broke the truce. Hamas said at least four senior officials were killed in Tuesday's strikes.\n\nThere were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment, indicating it still hoped to restore the truce. The strikes came as Netanyahu comes under mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel's internal security agency. His latest testimony in a long-running corruption trial was canceled after the strikes. The main group representing families of the captives accused the government of backing out of the ceasefire, saying it “chose to give up on the hostages.” “We are shocked, angry and terrified by the deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. Wounded stream into Gaza hospitals A strike on a home in the southern city of Rafah killed 17 members of one family, including at least 12 women and children, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children.\n\nIn the southern city of Khan Younis, Associated Press reporters saw explosions and plumes of smoke. Ambulances brought wounded people to Nasser Hospital, where patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged. Many Palestinians said they had expected a return to war when talks over the second phase of the ceasefire did not begin as scheduled in early February. Israel instead embraced an alternative proposal and cut off all shipments of food, fuel and other aid to the territory's 2 million Palestinians to try to pressure Hamas to accept it. “Nobody wants to fight,” Palestinian resident Nidal Alzaanin told the AP by phone from Gaza City. \"Everyone is still suffering from the previous months,” he said. Gaza's Health Ministry said at least 404 people were killed in the strikes and more than 560 had been wounded. It revised its confirmed count after saying earlier Tuesday that 413 were dead and 660 wounded. Rescuers were still searching the rubble for dead and wounded as the strikes continued. It was among the deadliest days of the war.\n\nUS backs Israel and blames Hamas The White House sought to blame Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group \"could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.” An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas' military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks. The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect. Netanyahu's office said the Israeli leader held security consultations with senior officials. It did not provide further details. Talks on a second phase of the ceasefire had stalled The strikes came two months after a ceasefire was reached to pause the war. Over six weeks, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in a first phase of the ceasefire.\n\nBut since that ceasefire ended two weeks ago, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward with a second phase aimed at releasing the 59 remaining hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead, and ending the war altogether. Hamas has demanded an end to the war and full withdrawal of Israeli troops in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages. Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas' governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages — two goals that could be incompatible. Netanyahu's office on Tuesday said Hamas had “repeatedly refused to release our hostages and rejected all offers it received from the U.S. presidential envoy, Steve Witkoff, and from the mediators.” Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to follow the ceasefire deal reached by the two sides, which calls for negotiations to begin on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza.\n\nA return to war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase of the agreement and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza. It would also shore up his coalition, which depends on far-right lawmakers who want to depopulate Gaza and re-build Jewish settlements there. Gaza already was in a humanitarian crisis The war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies. Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population. The territory's Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children.\n\nThe ceasefire had brought some relief to Gaza and allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to resume to what remained of their homes. Netanyahu faces mounting criticism The released hostages, some of whom were emaciated, have repeatedly implored the government to press ahead with the ceasefire to return all remaining captives. Tens of thousands of Israelis have taken part in mass demonstrations calling for a ceasefire and return of all hostages. Mass demonstrations are planned later Tuesday and Wednesday following Netanyahu's announcement this week that he wants to fire the head of Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency. Critics have lambasted the move as an attempt by Netanyahu to divert blame for his government's failures in the Oct. 7 attack and handling of the war. Since the ceasefire in Gaza began in mid-January, Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military says approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas.\n\nStill, the deal has tenuously held without an outbreak of wide violence. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate the next steps in the ceasefire.\n\n___\n\nFederman reported from Jerusalem and Magdy from Cairo.

        "title": "Is Trump Imposing a New Travel Ban? Here's What to Know",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The Trump Administration is reportedly considering a new travel ban for citizens of up to 43 countries—a potential escalation of Trump’s first term travel ban which primarily targeted Muslim-majority countries. An internal memo, obtained and reviewed first by the New York Times and then by Reuters, suggests that the Trump Administration has included new countries in a draft of a 2.0 travel ban. Per the memo, the countries on the list would be sorted into three different tiers: red, orange, and yellow.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCitizens from the 11 countries in the “red” category would reportedly be flatly barred from entering the United States. The 11 countries listed include Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. The Times reported, though, that this list was formed by the State Department a few weeks ago and changes could well be made. Citizens from the countries in the “orange” category—which includes Haiti, Russia, and Pakistan—would have their visas heavily restricted. Per the Times' reporting, citizens traveling to the U.S. from these countries would be subjected to “mandatory in-person interviews” in order to receive a visa. The third category includes countries in the “yellow” group—meaning they have 60 days to address concerns from the Administration, or else each country risks being moved up to the other categories. Countries reportedly listed under this category include Cambodia, Zimbabwe, and The Republic of Congo.\n\nThe White House has yet to publicly comment on the reported memo. TIME has reached out to the White House for comment. Mention of a potential new travel ban by the Trump Administration comes shortly after the President was asked during a press briefing on Wednesday, March 12, about what countries might be targeted on his 2.0 list. He shut down the question from the reporter, saying: “Wouldn’t that be a stupid thing for me to say?” Trump made promises on his campaign trail, stating his intention to restore the travel ban which caught much attention during its initial introduction during his first term. His signing of an Executive Order titled “Protecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats” on Jan. 20 only served to reaffirm his intentions. Here’s a look back at the history of Trump’s travel ban and what he has shared about his plans moving forward.\n\nWhen former President Joe Biden entered office in 2021, he repealed the ban, calling it “a stain on our national conscience” and “inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all.” “[T]hey have separated loved ones, inflicting pain that will ripple for years to come. They are just plain wrong,” Biden said in the Executive Order announcing the end to the ban. Trump promised to reinstate the travel ban during his campaign While on the campaign trail in 2024, Trump vowed to reinstate his 2017 travel ban several times. In July, at a campaign rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Trump told the crowd that he would “restore the travel ban, suspend refugee admissions, stop the resettlement, and keep the terrorists the hell out of our country” and that he would do so on “day one” of his presidency. In a later campaign event in Washington, Trump said he would ban people from “terrorist infested” areas and would “seal our borders.”\n\n“Remember the famous travel ban? We didn’t take people from certain areas of the world,” Trump said at the event in September 2024. “We’re not taking them from infested countries.” Trump’s Executive Order on “vetting” countries Trump did not reintroduce his travel ban on “day one” as promised, but on the first day of his second term, he did sign the Executive Order titled “Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and other National Security and Public Safety Threats.” Within the Executive Order, Trump called for the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence to submit a report “identifying countries throughout the world for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.” A deadline of 60 days was given.\n\nIf the timeline remains the same, this report is due to the President by next week. Although he may well have already received it.\n\nThe Executive Order also called for the report to identify how many people from said countries had entered the United States since Biden was inaugurated as President.\n\nThis was just one Executive Order in a slew of recent motions signed by Trump that look to drastically shift and harden the United States’ immigration and visitation policy.",

        "title": "How the Social Safety Net Became for ‘Suckers’",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "In the last two months, Elon Musk has inserted himself into a range of government functions on the grounds that he and his team, the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE), have an urgent mandate to root out “government waste.” In the early rollout, Musk’s team claimed to see fraud everywhere: he reported that FEMA was sending migrants to “luxury hotels” and reposted a claim that USAID is “basically a form of money laundering.” And in a recent interview with the Fox Business Network, he announced, “The waste and fraud in entitlement spending — most of the federal spending is entitlements — that’s the big one to eliminate.” Entitlement spending includes Medicaid, Medicare, and, of course, Social Security.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMusk has called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” a direct accusation that support for the benefit is for chumps. He seems to be laying the groundwork for a full-scale assault on the most popular redistributive program in America with a line of thinking that society is, well, for suckers. Sharing, cooperating, promise-keeping, and helping—that kind of earnestness is for losers, not leaders. Musk purports to believe that many federal functions, especially within agencies like the EPA, the Department of Education, and even the FBI, harbor freeloaders at every turn. In February, he demanded that federal employees email DOGE with an accounting of what they had accomplished in the previous week, posting on X, “The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all! In some cases, we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks. In other words, there is outright fraud.” He has made the same claim about deceased Social Security beneficiaries, apparently based on a misunderstanding of the underlying coding, according to reporting by WIRED.\n\nRead More: Why We Hate Being Scammed On the one hand, many of the boldest claims appear so easily refutable that the whole campaign may be destined to implode. But I have been thinking about and studying the social science of feeling scammed for almost two decades, and I know that the emotional efficacy of sucker rhetoric distorts our moral and political reasoning. Even when the accusations are unfounded, even when the risks are small, the mere possibility of being a sucker can be psychologically potent enough to undermine a rational preference for cooperation. It is all too easy to convince people that compassion and integrity are illusory—that, as historian Anne Applebaum wrote in 2018, in Trump’s America “morality is for losers.” Understanding the rhetorical power of warning Americans that they are being played for suckers, at a personal and visceral level, was part of the winning strategy of the 2016 Trump candidacy. He held himself out as the voice of reason who could see humane asylum policies and international cooperation for what they really were: traps for the unwary. Now the appeal of that rhetoric is being put to a new test.\n\nPsychologically, the fear of being a sucker is a distinctly aversive feeling. Most people are so acutely attuned to the threat of feeling duped that even minor scam risks can contaminate their decision-making, both in terms of everyday financial and social decision-making, and also at the level of their core values and deeper goals. Trust is risky, and there is ample evidence from social science that the risk of being conned sparks a special risk aversion. People will go way out of their way to avoid even the suggestion that they are about to play the fool. In a famous study from 2011, research participants shown a promising startup company were willing to gamble a lot when the 5% downside risk was due to overestimating market demand, but willing to invest much less if that same 5% downside risk was the small chance that the founders were “fraudsters.” Same risk, different psychological resonance, and perhaps why Trump and Musk’s deployment of that sort of language is so effective. Most of us recoil, or retaliate, at the first suggestion that we might be taken advantage of; as threats go, the warning that you’re a sucker works.\n\nSince he came into office last month, Trump has gone after a range of vulnerable targets. Whatever you think about the rightness or competence of the underlying missions, the human harm has been real and widespread. Patients have been turned away from lifesaving medical intervention abroad; American government and university workers are losing their jobs; visas are being revoked. Real people, with lives and obligations, are suffering. We might think, or hope, that Musk and Trump are overplaying their hands. Billionaires targeting workers, refugees, and SSI recipients—the optics ought to be terrible. But the relentless search for scammers coming from marginalized groups has a reliable psychological appeal. One of the core insights of Trump’s populism is that he seems to see how the sucker rhetoric is tied to status anxiety. There is an extra humiliation, and thus an extra threat, to being suckered by someone you think should be below you on the social ladder, behind you in the line for promotion or priority seating. (“If they can put one over on me, what does that make me?” the thinking goes.) Trump’s obsessive policing of who’s the sucker has given him political clout with a populace trained to be vigilant to the prospect of being scammed—even by the least plausible fraudsters. In the meantime, scammy behavior by rich men is routinely coded as “savvy” instead of grotesque. So it invites the question: who’s conning who right now?\n\nRead More: How Insecurity Became the New Inequality The line between the helper and the pawn is easily manipulated. All it takes is some vague warnings about government waste and suddenly paying your taxes means you’re a dupe; after a few headlines about 150-year-olds on Social Security, a modest retirement benefit looks like a reward for cheating the system.\n\n\n\nBut that whole framework is wrong. It is tempting to respond to Musk’s numbers with direct refutation (no, DOGE has not saved taxpayers 115 billion dollars), but it’s better to refuse the premise altogether. We can support government efficiency and nonetheless insist that it is destructive to approach our most important cooperative ventures with rank suspicion. Living in a society requires trust, and with that trust comes some vulnerability. Alleviating human suffering is the right goal for a government to have. And Social Security, a self-funded program that keeps millions of American retirees out of poverty every year, achieves widespread good with remarkable efficiency.\n\nThe fear of playing the sucker is often weaponized for political ends, but it can only cover so much real harm, and right now, real harm abounds. One laid-off IRS worker—a Trump supporter himself—described the juxtaposition to NBC10, the sucker’s stakes versus the human stakes. “You know, when he talks about government waste and all that, yes, I’m behind it. I believe there is a lot of stuff in the government that needs fixing.” So far, though, all he sees is a billionaire “coming in with a wrecking ball and destroying people’s lives for no reason.”",

        "title": "Percival Everett Is Challenging the American Literary Canon",
        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Percival Everett claims he is not as brilliant as his fans know him to be. He deeply researches the worlds in which his novels are set, yet swears that everything he learns falls out of his head as soon as each book is published. “So I’m no smarter at the end than I was at the beginning,” he says, shrugging his shoulders. Years ago, sick of his writing students asking him if they were good enough to be published, he took a class to a bookstore in Middlebury, Vt., to prove he was not unique. “Look around,” he told them. “Anyone can be published. ‘Are you good enough to make a difference?’ is the question.”\n\nWith his latest, James, a reimagining of Huckleberry Finn told from the perspective of the escaped slave Jim—who drops his nickname for the more noble-sounding James—Everett has jump-started a conversation about the great American novel, how issues of race interplay with the so-called American canon, and how we talk to our children about America’s past. But just a few hours before he wins the National Book Award for fiction, he demurs when pressed on the book’s impact. “If a reader is coming to me for any kind of message or answer about anything in the world,” he says, “they’re already in deep trouble.”\n\nFor many, however, James has become an important companion piece to Mark Twain’s work, the book “all American literature comes from,” to quote Ernest Hemingway. “I’ve been getting lots of mail from former and current English teachers thanking me that they can now teach Huck Finn again because they can do it alongside James,” he admits, “which is great news for me and certainly flattering, but doesn’t come as a great surprise. It’s a problematic text.”\n\nEverett, 68, would do away with the canon altogether if he could. But at the very least he hopes that writers, readers, and educators can acknowledge the inherent issues with putting certain books on a pedestal. “My joke is, ‘The canon is loaded,’” says Everett. “Canon formation is necessarily skewed. It’s necessarily racist and sexist. As soon as you’re saying there are these texts that must be read, someone has to choose. Who chooses?”\n\nWhile Jim is little more than a sidekick on Huck’s journey down the Mississippi in the original, in Everett’s version he is at the center of the story. James and other Black characters code switch when white characters are present; on his own, James interrogates philosophers like Voltaire for his repugnant views on slavery. “Enslaved people, it had occurred to me, are always depicted as simple-minded and superstitious, and of course, they weren’t,” Everett says. “So I embarked on this.”\n\nEverett gives James the gift of language, and James writes his account of his travels with a stolen pencil stub—one which comes at great human cost. “Whoever controls language, controls everything. If someone has no voice, they cannot get what they want or what they need,” says Everett.\n\nEverett, who has published two dozen novels, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist Telephone, has historically bristled at being categorized in the genre of African American fiction, especially considering he has written everything from propulsive westerns to a novella styled like a Lifetime movie. “Any work of art that comes out of this American culture is about race. If there is no race in it, that is a statement about race,” he says.\n\nThis frustration is at the heart of Erasure, one of Everett’s early and best-known novels, which was adapted into the Oscar-winning 2023 film American Fiction. The story centers on Thelonious “Monk” Ellison, the author of experimental novels that don’t sell particularly well. Monk becomes so exasperated with the publishing industry bolstering Black fiction that depicts only stereotypes that he pens a novel as an illiterate thug to prove a point. The book is a hit, much to the author’s chagrin. James, too, will get the Hollywood treatment, with Steven Spielberg producing and Taika Waititi in talks to direct, though Everett insists this attention is “fleeting.” “I'll write some experimental novel next that no one will understand,” he says. “You would have to be crazy to get into literary fiction to get famous or to get rich.”",

        "content": "January’s unveiling of DeepSeek R1, China's most advanced AI model to date, signals a dangerous inflection point in the global AI race. As President Donald Trump warned in his recent address on technological security, this development represents nothing short of a \"wake-up call\" for American leadership. What's at stake isn't merely economic competitiveness but perhaps the most geopolitically precarious technology since the atomic bomb In the nuclear age that followed Oppenheimer's creation of the atomic bomb, America's technological monopoly lasted roughly four years before Soviet scientists achieved parity. This balance of terror, combined with the unprecedented destructive potential of these new weapons, gave rise to mutual assured destruction (MAD)—a deterrence framework that, despite its flaws, prevented catastrophic conflict for decades. The stakes of nuclear retaliation discourage each side from striking first, ultimately allowing for a tense but stable standoff\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nToday's AI competition has the potential to be even more complex than the nuclear era that preceded it, in part because AI is a broadly applicable technology that touches nearly every domain, from medicine to finance to defense. Powerful AI may even automate AI research itself, giving the first nation to possess it an expanding lead in both defensive and offensive power. A nation on the cusp of wielding superintelligent AI, an AI vastly smarter than humans in virtually every domain, would amount to a national security emergency for its rivals, who might turn to threatening sabotage rather than cede power. If we are heading towards a world with superintelligence, we must be clear-eyed about the potential for geopolitical instability. We map out some of the geopolitical implications of powerful AI and propose a cohesive “Superintelligence Strategy” in a new paper released this week. Let us imagine how the U.S. might reasonably respond to rival states seeking an insurmountable AI advantage. Suppose Beijing established a lead over American AI labs and reached the cusp of recursively-improving superintelligence before us. Regardless of whether Beijing could maintain control over what it was building, U.S. national security would be deeply and existentially threatened. Rationally, the U.S. might resort to threatening sabotage in the form of cyberattacks against AI datacenters to prevent China from achieving its goal. We might similarly expect Xi Jinping—or Vladimir Putin, who has little chance of obtaining the technology first—to respond in a similar fashion if we approach recursively-improving superintelligence. They would not stand idly by if a U.S. monopoly on power was imminent.\n\nJust as the destabilizing pursuit of nuclear monopoly eventually gave way to the stability of MAD during the nuclear era, we may soon enter a parallel deterrence dynamic for AI. If any state that attempts to seize AI supremacy can expect the threat of preemptive sabotage, states may be deterred from pursuing unilateral power altogether. We call this outcome Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM). As nations wake up to this possibility, we expect it will become the default regime, and we need to prepare now for this new strategic reality. MAIM is a deterrence framework designed to maintain strategic advantage, prevent escalation, and restrict the ambitions of rivals and malicious actors. For this to work, the U.S. must make clear that any rival destabilizing AI project, especially those aiming for superintelligence, will provoke retaliation. Here, offense—or at least the credible threat of offense—is likely the best defense. That means expanding our cyberattack capabilities and enhancing surveillance of adversary AI programs.\n\nWhile building this deterrence framework, America must simultaneously advance on two additional fronts: AI nonproliferation and domestic competitiveness.\n\nFor nonproliferation, we should enact stronger AI chip export controls and monitoring to stop compute power getting into the hands of dangerous people. We should treat AI chips more like uranium, keeping tight records of product movements, building in limitations on what high-end AI chips are authorized to do, and granting federal agencies the authority to track and shut down illicit distribution routes.\n\nFinally, to maintain a competitive edge, the U.S. should focus on building resilience in its supply chains for military tech and computing power. In particular, our reliance on Taiwan for AI chips is a glaring vulnerability and a critical chokepoint. While the West has a decisive AI chip advantage, Chinese competition could disrupt that. The U.S. should therefore step up its domestic design and manufacturing capabilities. Superintelligent AI poses a challenge as elusive as any that policymakers have faced. It is what theorists Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber called a “wicked problem,” one that continually evolves with no final formula for resolution. MAIM, supplemented by robust nonproliferation and renewed investment in American industry, offers a strategy grounded in the lessons of past arms races. There is no purely technical fix that can tame these forces, but the right alignment of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness measures can help the United States navigate the emerging geopolitical reality of superintelligence.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "Canada’s energy minister is angry. Speaking to me while in Houston for CERAWeek, Jonathan Wilkinson described the phases of Canada’s reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and repeated taunting: shock, then hurt, and now anger. “We are resolute in our need to push back,” he says. Wilkinson says that the anger shouldn’t influence his government’s decision making. But, at the same time, no option is off the table—including restrictions on energy and natural resources. Because of the highly-linked energy systems of the two countries, such a move could wreak significant havoc on the U.S. economy. “We would be foolish to take tools out of the toolbox,” he told me. “In the context where there's no negotiation around trying to find a resolution here, certainly, export tariffs on energy remain in that toolbox.”\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere are many potential energy and climate change implications of the U.S.-initiated trade dispute. In the short term, Canada’s political conversation has been consumed by trade talks—squeezing out space for resolving some of the country’s thorny energy and climate policy debates. In the longer term, a sustained and intensified U.S.-Canada trade spat could lead to more investment in fossil fuel infrastructure in both countries. And, even under a new U.S. administration, this moment will not be forgotten, making it more difficult to build durable partnerships in areas like critical minerals—a key component of the energy transition. “Under the new Prime Minister, Canada remains committed to the fight against climate change,” says Wilkinson, referring to the newly elected prime minister Mark Carney. But “some elements of the climate plan probably have become a little tougher in the context of working with the Trump Administration.”\n\nTrump’s tariffs have shocked executives across the corporate world—and the energy industry is no exception. The sector is highly integrated, especially across the U.S.-Canada border. In the U.S. midwest, oil refineries run on crude that flows from Canada. In much of the northeast U.S., Canadian electricity helps keep the lights on. Meanwhile, Canada imports U.S. oil in its eastern provinces. “The integrated nature of the two economies, and in particular of the energy economies… pulling them apart is almost impossible,” says Wilkinson. And yet, nonetheless, Wilkinson says his country will be looking away from the U.S. “Canadians' confidence in their ability to simply rely on the United States to the exclusion of the rest of the world has been shaken.” A key area that may suffer is potential collaboration between the two countries on the critical minerals that will play an essential role in the energy transition. Canada has rich stores of lithium, cobalt, and nickel, among other resources, and had previously worked with the U.S. government to create a North American supply chain for batteries and other clean energy technologies. While Trump is no fan of the energy transition, he has homed in on critical minerals in his push to annex Greenland given the essential role the minerals play in manufacturing, defense, and advanced electronics. “Critical minerals in particular are a potentially useful tool, if we have to go there, given that the alternative sources of supply typically are going to be China, in some cases Russia,” Wilkinson said on March 12. “We're not there yet, and we prefer not to further escalate this at this point.”\n\nA prolonged, deepened trade rift could push Canada to look more to Europe, South Korea, and Japan to help finance and purchase the product that comes with developing these resources. That would leave the U.S. at a disadvantage and reshape the centers of power in clean technologies. At CERAWeek, an energy conference that draws the world’s biggest players in the industry, some executives chatted about the possibility that Canada might revive plans to build an oil pipeline from the country’s oil producing west to its eastern cities. This would reduce Canada’s reliance on U.S. oil in the east and make it easier to sell Canadian oil domestically. Wilkinson offered deep skepticism, telling me that such a project would face difficult economics and likely require government subsidy. Nonetheless, he said, it could be worth considering on national security grounds should the situation deteriorate further.\n\n“Presently, there is no one proposing to build a pipeline,” he says. “You could argue that there is an energy security issue, and that is a legitimate conversation… but we should be looking at all available options.”\n\nLike with much else tied to Trump Administration policy, it is hard to assess the exact climate implications of this trade rift. At the very least, it’s a distraction for Canada. When I first met Wilkinson last year, we had extensive conversations about the country’s carbon tax and engagement with the country’s Indigenous First Nations to build energy projects. Progress on those issues now feels miniscule in the scheme of things. But, more broadly, it provides a hint of what world may emerge in the wake of Trump’s wrecking ball: less collaboration and clean technology supply chains that don’t include the U.S.\n\nTo get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — The crown jewel of El Salvador's aggressive anti-crime strategy — a mega-prison where visitation, recreation and education are not allowed — became the latest tool in U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration on Sunday, when hundreds of immigrants facing deportation were transferred there. The arrival of the immigrants, alleged by the U.S. to be members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang, took place under an agreement for which the Trump administration will pay the government of President Nayib Bukele $6 million for one year of services.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBukele has made the Central American country’s stark, harsh prisons a trademark of his fight against crime. In 2023, he opened the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, where the immigrants were sent over the weekend even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring their deportations under an 18th century wartime declaration targeting Venezuelan gang members. Read More: Trump Administration Deports Hundreds of Migrants, Despite Judge's Order Stopping Removal What is the CECOT? Bukele ordered the mega-prison built as he began his campaign against El Salvador’s gangs in March 2022. It opened a year later in the town of Tecoluca, about 72 kilometers (45 miles) east of the capital. The facility has eight sprawling pavilions and can hold up to 40,000 inmates. Each cell can fit 65 to 70 prisoners. CECOT prisoners do not receive visits and are never allowed outdoors. The prison does not offer workshops or educational programs to prepare them to return to society after their sentences.\n\nOccasionally, prisoners who have gained a level of trust from prison officials give motivational talks. Prisoners sit in rows in the corridor outside their cells for the talks or are led through exercise regimens under the supervision of guards. Bukele’s justice minister has said that those held at CECOT would never return to their communities. The prison's dining halls, break rooms, gym and board games are for guards. How many prisoners does El Salvador hold? The government doesn’t regularly update the figure, but the human rights organization Cristosal reported that in March 2024 El Salvador had 110,000 people behind bars, including those sentenced to prison and those still awaiting trial. That's more than double the 36,000 inmates that the government reported in April 2021, a year before Bukele ramped up his fight against crime. Cristosal and other advocates have accused authorities of human rights violations.\n\nCristosal reported last year that at least 261 people had died in El Salvador’s prisons during the gang crackdown. The group and others have cited cases of abuse, torture and lack of medical attention. In slickly produced videos, the government has shown CECOT prisoners in boxer shorts marching into common areas and made to sit nearly atop each other. Cells lack enough bunks for everyone. Why were immigrants sent to CECOT? The migrants were deported after Trump’s declaration of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has been used only three times in U.S. history. The law requires a president to declare the U.S. is at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners who otherwise would have protections under immigration or criminal laws. Trump claimed the Tren de Aragua gang was invading the U.S. in invoking the wartime authority. Tren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in Venezuela and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation’s economy came undone last decade.\n\nThe Trump administration has not identified the migrants deported, provided any evidence they are in fact members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the U.S.\n\nVideo released by El Salvador’s government Sunday showed men exiting airplanes into an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down to have them bend at the waist.\n\nThe video also showed the men being transported to CECOT in a large convoy of buses guarded by police and military vehicles and at least one helicopter. The men were shown kneeling on the ground as their heads were shaved before they changed into the prison’s all-white uniform – knee-length shorts, T-shirt, socks and rubber clogs – and placed in cells.\n\n—Garcia Cano reported from Caracas, Venezuela.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "If you can’t spend an hour or two with Colman Domingo in real life, you can still find the key to his spirit—the sense of the joy he both draws from the world and puts back into it—in a family photograph from Easter 1976. There’s Colman at age 6, a pint-size gent perched between his older sister and brother, wearing a candy-striped blazer so groovy you wouldn’t be surprised to see it on Sammy Davis Jr. at a Cocoanut Grove show. Elegant and poised, he gazes straight at the camera, his legs crossed just so. He brought this picture along when he appeared on The View in late November, and after the show’s hosts had finished cooing over its adorableness, he provided the backstory: The navy pants he’s wearing in the photo had a matching jacket, but it was too small. He grabbed the striped one instead, though his mother observed that it didn’t quite match. “But it makes me feel good!” he told her, and instead of arguing, she told him, “Wear what makes you feel good,” setting him on the path he follows to this day.\n\nDomingo, now 55, is known for his creative yet classic red-carpet style, inspired by influences ranging from Fred Astaire to the Ohio Players, Cary Grant to Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes—it makes perfect sense that he’s been named one of the chairs of this spring’s Met Gala, the theme of which is “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” Style is integral to Domingo’s spirit, as a way of communicating, of pushing out into the world, of connecting with Black men and women who came before him—which is to say that anyone who believes style is superficial hasn’t met Domingo. How he dresses, how he moves, even how he sips from a coffee cup: all these things are so casually entwined with who he is—as a performer, certainly, but also as a writer, director, producer, and, just generally speaking, a person who’s alive to the world—that they charge the air around him.\n\nGenerosity begins with the self, and Domingo is so at ease that he has extra grace to spare. In a politically and emotionally precarious world, where people seem to have stopped caring for one another, those molecules of grace are like gold. “Everything I do is about radical love,” Domingo says, over a coffee at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. “It's about seeing each other. What am I doing as a creative? It's about getting people to think, maybe helping people think differently. You know, that's all I can do. The macro I can't take care of. But I can take care of the micro.”\n\nPhotograph by Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nClick here to order your copy of this issue\n\nDomingo has earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his superb performance in Sing Sing, Greg Kwedar’s drawn-from-real-life film about men who find redemption through a prison theater program. This is Domingo’s second nomination in as many years: he was also recognized for his turn, both charming and fiery, as civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in George C. Wolfe’s 2023 biopic Rustin. (He’s the first actor to be nominated two years in a row since Denzel Washington, who earned nods for Fences, in 2017, and Roman J. Israel, Esq., the following year.) He’s the anchor of Netflix’s multipart thriller The Madness, in which he plays a media pundit who stumbles into a murder plot in the woods of the Poconos. And the projects he’s got going, for 2025 and beyond, stack far into the sky: He plays patriarch Joe Jackson in Antoine Fuqua’s upcoming Michael Jackson biopic and stars in Tina Fey’s upcoming series The Four Seasons, a reimagining of Alan Alda’s 1981 comedy. He’s ready to direct and star in a Nat King Cole biopic he’s written, and to direct a drama about the romance between Sammy Davis Jr. and Kim Novak too.\n\nBut even if the spotlight around Domingo now seems particularly bright, he has in fact been everywhere for a while now: In the early 2000s he splashed out in Broadway shows like Passing Strange and The Scottsboro Boys, garnering a Tony nomination for the latter. In 2022 he won a Primetime Emmy for his recurring role in Euphoria. Moviegoers know him from pictures like Lincoln, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Zola, and The Color Purple.\n\nStill, after working as one sort of performer or another for some 35 years, he’s grateful for—and more than a little surprised at—all the extra attention he’s gotten in the past five years or so. “How can I say it? I did not intend for this at all. I wanted to be a respected actor, and I found my work as a character actor mostly in the theater. I feel like that's where I was most useful, and that's where I was best being served.” As he began to take more television roles, opportunities began shifting. “It felt like the roles were meeting me and I was meeting the roles.” Now, he knows exactly how fortunate he is, and he’s also in a place where he can effect change for others. “I’m like, ‘Oooh, I get to have an impact? What can I do? What can I disrupt?’” He laughs, a great, sonorous laugh that sounds as if it could have rolled in from the ocean, even though Domingo was born and grew up in West Philly. “That's what I want to do, and really do it in the most loving, gracious, generous way possible.”\n\n****\n\nOne of Domingo’s early gigs was as a “party starter” for bar mitzvahs, getting recalcitrant guests out on the dance floor. Though he has no formal dance training, he moves through the world on springy, lily-stem legs, and it’s hard to imagine Mrs. Rosensweig, or anyone, resisting his effervescence. But given the way he carries himself in every interaction, it’s likely Domingo offered something else too: not just charm and fancy footwork but safety, the feeling that, if you join him, he’ll have your back.\n\nFor his appearance on The View, he invited his two nieces—one is actually a family friend, but he considers her family—to hang out in the greenroom with him beforehand and later watch the show from the audience. And to observe him with family—or even the small cadre of assistants on hand to make the day go smoothly—is to see a man who doesn’t think twice before opening a door for others, literally or figuratively. It’s not only fun to be around him, but almost calming—as if he were looking after the welfare of everyone in his orbit, even amid all the demands that come with being a hardworking performer and, now, a truly famous person.\n\nHis friends seem to feel that way too. Writer-director-actor Bradley Cooper met Domingo when the two found themselves on the awards circuit last year, Cooper for his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro and Domingo for Rustin. “I think it was like a CAA party after the Golden Globes or something,” Cooper says by phone from New York. “I went up to him, and we had a wonderful conversation. He was just a luminous human being.” The two exchanged numbers and have since built a friendship. Domingo says Cooper has been a great sounding board for his Nat King Cole project; Cooper demurs—he doesn’t think he’s helped that much—but he values having a friend he can talk to about projects that matter. “It's always nice to talk to somebody who's going down or has gone down a similar path,” he says, “and whenever he wants to talk about anything, I would just share my experience and things that I've learned and need to work on, or want to work on. Anytime he's asked me something, I actually feel privileged that he even wants my input.” Cooper is also, simply, happy to have found a true friend. “As you get older, you tend not to make new friends. But I made a new friend, which is kind of wonderful. And he allows that space to be a friend to somebody, which is beautiful.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo, like Cooper, has ideas to spare. He’s eager to take on bigger and more ambitious projects—more disruption of the loving, gracious, generous kind. But like lots of successful people, he’s earned his self-assurance day-by-day. He never thought the career he has now was a sure thing. “I'm happy that I'm being met in this moment on my terms, in the way that I wanted to be seen. I didn't have to become some kind of other artist, who has to leave parts of themselves behind. I bring all of me into it. I bring all my years as a theater practitioner, as a director, as a writer, as a producer. Even when the industry wanted me to just pick one.”\n\nBy showcasing his talent across film and TV, Domingo has broadened his scope in a way that allows him to share the wealth. All through 2024, as studio and streaming execs balked at greenlighting risky or ambitious projects—even as many who make their living in TV and movies were still scrambling to recover not just from the pandemic, but from the actors’ and writers’ strikes—the motto of many who’d seen work dry up was “Survive till ‘25.” And that was before so many lost their homes in the horrific Los Angeles wildfires. (Domingo’s house, in Malibu, was spared.) So while he’s riding high, he’s using his career not just to gain recognition for himself but also to help determine which stories get told. In other words, it isn’t just about climbing higher; it’s about lifting others.\n\nHis involvement with Sing Sing, as both an actor and an executive producer, is a case in point. When he signed on to play John “Divine G” Whitfield—a man, wrongly imprisoned, who finds a lifeline in the performing arts—director and co-writer Kwedar, along with the film’s other writers and producers, suggested a parity model in which everyone involved would be paid the same rate. Domingo loved the idea. “My heart just opened. I don’t know if it works for every project. But I think there are elements of it that can work, especially when it comes to low-budget features. You're doing it because you love it, and you want to be a part of it.” And when the project succeeds, everyone benefits, not just a few people at the top. “I think that's just fair,” Domingo says. “So when we did sell the movie to A24, the most beautiful thing was to know the checks were being written out to every single department, and every person. That felt so good and so meaningful, especially right now, when the industry is having an existential crisis. This model can help be a game changer, so that everyone feels respected.”\n\nColman Domingo photographed in London on Jan. 19 Campbell Addy for TIME\n\nDomingo’s Sing Sing co-star, Clarence Maclin, is a veteran of the real-life prison program that inspired the film, Rehabilitation Through the Arts, and one of the many formerly incarcerated men who have roles in the movie. He plays a version of himself, a man whose capacity for growth expands when he becomes involved with the program. Maclin, who’d gotten his acting training at Sing Sing, with its terrible acoustics and, as he puts it, “sucky sound system,” knew how to project; Domingo helped him tailor his performance to the intimacy of the camera lens. But what Maclin took from their collaboration goes beyond mere tips about technique. “He’s the genuine article when it comes to someone who definitely is going to be there, someone who means what they say about what they want to do and what their intentions are,” Maclin says via Zoom. “The things I want to be, I see in him already, and it's like a guide.”\n\nThe idea, as Maclin clearly gets, is that living in the world means so much more than looking out for No. 1. We need to focus on what connects us rather than divides us. I met with Domingo three weeks after the election, at a time when many were still feeling stunned—and more than a little helplessly frozen—by the results. As a gay Black man, one who stands up for the people and causes he cares about, he knows the road ahead might be bumpy. But when he woke up on Nov. 6, he didn’t panic. Instead, “I thought, OK, this is where we are.” Again, he vibrates with so much radiant energy that it’s impossible to feel hopeless around him. A conversation with him leaves you with the feeling that he’s handing you a key; it’s up to you to find the right door to open, but you know you can do it, even if you’re not a spectacular-looking six-foot-plus movie star who moves through every space—and the world—with lanky, liquid grace. “The pendulum does swing,” he says. “My parents went through a lot, my grandparents went through even worse. And I am here, where I am in my life, but also as a proud descendant of slaves who lived, loved, and fought, and sacrificed, so I could be here. So I can't hold my head down and be sad or despondent about anything. I have to roll up my sleeves to continue to get to work: Fight, love, be joyful in a very revolutionary way.”\n\nThis is how you honor those who came before you while also opening a corridor for everyone who will follow. This is how you get the party started.\n\nSet design by Ibby Njoya; styling by Ola Ebiti; grooming by Mata Mariélle; production by Ragi Dholakia Productions; retouching by Touch Digital",

        "content": "When astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams embarked on Boeing’s Starliner capsule on June 5, 2024, they expected to be away from home for just over a week. Instead, they spent around 9 months in orbit on the International Space Station. But after over 286 days, their extended stay in space is finally coming to a close, as the two astronauts make their way back to Earth on a SpaceX capsule that’s set to splash down off the coast of Florida on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWilmore, 62, and Williams, 59, are both veteran NASA astronauts and retired U.S. Navy test pilots. Williams became an astronaut in 1998 and Wilmore in 2000. The two were the first crew aboard what was meant to be a quick test flight for the Starliner. But the vessel was plagued with problems that almost prevented it from making it to the ISS, including a helium leak and thruster malfunctions. NASA ordered the Boeing capsule to return unmanned in September, while Wilmore and Williams were left aboard the space station awaiting a safe flight home. At the end of January, President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk blamed the Biden Administration for delaying the astronauts’ return—which former space station commander Andreas Morgensen called “a lie.” Musk claimed in posts on X that SpaceX offered to bring Williams and Wilmore home months earlier, but that it was denied for “political reasons.” (Former NASA officials said no offer was made to the space agency, and former NASA administrator Bill Nelson said the decision to wait until February for the stranded astronauts to return home rested on safety procedures).\n\nIn August, NASA decided to bring them back on a SpaceX capsule. The Dragon-9 vessel launched in September but remained docked at the ISS while waiting for a relief crew. That relief mission saw hold-ups: the scheduled flight was meant to launch in February but was delayed due to battery work on the SpaceX capsule. A hydraulics issue delayed another launch attempt last Wednesday with a new SpaceX capsule. On Friday, NASA and SpaceX successfully launched the Crew-10 mission to orbit with four astronauts aboard a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS on Saturday to relieve Wilmore and Williams. Such a long time spent in space can take a physical and mental toll, but Wilmore and Williams’ expedition isn’t the longest spaceflight. Five previous American astronauts—including the U.S. record-holder Frank Rubio as well as Peggy Whitson, who has spent the most cumulative days in space for an American astronaut—have spent more days in space on a single mission. And Russian cosmonauts hold the worldwide records for both consecutive and cumulative days in space.\n\nWorld’s longest single stay in space: Valery Polyakov\n\nCosmonaut Valery Polyakov looks out the window of the Russian space station Mir during its rendevous with the space shuttle Voyager on Feb. 6, 1995. Corbis/Getty Images\n\nRussian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov set the world record for the longest single spaceflight in history in 1995, spending 437 days, 17 hours, and 38 minutes in space and orbiting the Earth 7,075 times, according to the New Mexico Museum of Space History. Having studied astronautical medicine at Moscow’s Institute of Medical and Biological Problems, Polyakov became an asset to the study of the effects of space on the human body. At the age of 46, he launched to the Mir space station aboard Soyuz TM-6 on Aug. 29, 1988—16 years after becoming a Soviet cosmonaut in 1972. He was accompanied by fellow Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Lyakhov and Abdul Ahad Momand, Afghanistan’s first astronaut. While the rest of his crew returned to Earth just a week later, Polyakov stayed on to monitor the health of cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov, who endured the first year-long spaceflight. After Titov and Manarov returned to Earth in December 1988, Polyakov remained on Mir for another four months to await two new crewmembers.\n\nPolyakov ultimately returned to Earth in April 1989, marking more than 240 days in space, according to the Moscow Times. For his record-setting second mission, Polyakov was aboard Mir for 14 months, beginning on Jan. 8, 1994. Across 25 experiments and investigations, he studied the physical and cognitive functions of rotating crews from Russia, Kazakhstan, Germany, and the U.S. On March 22, 1995, Polyakov boarded the Soyuz TM-20 spacecraft, alongside Aleksandr Viktorenko and Yelena Kondakova, to return to Earth. Upon his return, Polyakov refused the standard practice of being carried out of the spacecraft, instead insisting on walking himself with some assistance, according to author of The Story of Manned Space Stations, Philip Baker. His extended expedition allowed scientists to study how human bodies might be affected by long-distance voyages, such as to Mars. Tests found that he was neither physically nor cognitively impaired.\n\nPolyakov died on Sept. 19, 2022, at the age of 80. U.S. longest single stay in space: Frank Rubio\n\nSalvadoran-American NASA astronaut Frank Rubio speaks during a press conference at the United States embassy in San Salvador, El Salvador, on April 8, 2024. Aphotografia/Getty Images)\n\nWith 371 consecutive days spent in space, Salvadoran American astronaut Frank Rubio broke the record for the longest spaceflight by an American and the longest time spent aboard the International Space Station. He landed in Kazakhstan on the morning of Sept. 27, 2023, more than a year after leaving Earth. Rubio was launched into space on Sept. 21, 2022, aboard the Russian spacecraft Soyuz MS-22—his first mission since becoming a NASA astronaut in 2019. The mission was initially expected to take six months, but the spacecraft suffered a coolant leak, forcing the trip to be extended. Russia’s space agency sent an uncrewed Soyuz MS-23 spacecraft to bring home Rubio and his crewmates, Russian cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin.\n\nRubio’s time in space spanned 5,963 orbits of the Earth and more than 157 million miles. He beat the previous record for an American astronaut of 355 days set by Mark Vande Hei. World’s longest total time in space: Oleg Kononenko\n\nExpedition 59 crew member Oleg Kononenko of Roscosmos outside the Soyuz MS-11 spacecraft after landing in a remote area near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, on June 25, 2019.

Oleg Kononenko became the first person to log a total of 1000 days in space last June—an equivalent of 33 months. Kononenko broke the previous record of 878 cumulative days in orbit set by fellow cosmonaut Gennady Padalka. His time in space spanned 16 years, five ISS expeditions, and 16,000 orbits around the Earth.\n\nU.S. longest total time in space: Peggy Whitson\n\nExpedition 50 NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson ahead of the final qualification exams at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) in Star City, Russia, on Oct. 25, 2016. Bill Ingalls—NASA/Getty Images\n\nWhitson, 65, has broken several records over the course of her astronautical career. In 2017, she broke the U.S. record for the longest cumulative time spent in space of 534 days set by NASA astronaut Jeff Williams, and has held the record since, accumulating 675 total days. She also holds the record for the longest cumulative and consecutive times spent in space for a woman of any nationality, and became the first female commander of the ISS in 2008—and the first woman to command it a second time in 2016. She has flown on three long-duration missions with NASA, and one flight with Axiom Space.\n\nWilliams moves just behind Whitson notching a total of 608 cumulative days in space after her third spaceflight. (Wilmore, meanwhile, will have spent a total of 404 cumulative days in space across his three spaceflights.)",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The Trump Administration appeared to openly defy multiple court orders over the weekend, deepening concerns among Democrats and legal experts that the constitutional crisis many feared when President Donald Trump was elected has now arrived. On Saturday, federal officials ignored an order from Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who had directed the government to turn around deportation flights carrying Venezuelan detainees. Instead, the planes continued on their course to El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele, a Trump ally, boasted that the 238 detainees would be held for at least a year in the country’s Terrorism Confinement Center. “Oopsie … Too late,” Bukele wrote on social media, a post later amplified by White House officials. Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed gratitude to the Salvadoran president, pointedly ignoring the judge’s ruling.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA day earlier, in Boston, a similar scenario played out. A federal judge had issued a restraining order to block the deportation of Rasha Alawieh, a Brown University medical professor with a valid visa returning from a family visit to Lebanon. Despite the order, she was deported anyway. Taken together, the incidents suggest that the Trump Administration is increasingly willing to brush aside judicial authority in pursuit of its policy goals. It follows a pattern in which Trump and his allies have sought to test the limits of judicial power, sometimes circumventing rulings, other times attacking judges outright. The country is “far beyond” a constitutional crisis, says Kim Wehle, a law professor at the University of Baltimore and a former assistant U.S. attorney. “A constitutional crisis is the accumulation of unchecked power in one branch. We’ve seen now for weeks the Trump Administration ignoring acts of Congress,” says Wehle, noting that the President has ignored Congress’ constitutional power of the purse by withholding federal funds and by terminating federal employees and senior officials without cause.\n\nOther legal scholars, while alarmed, hesitate to label the administration’s actions as an outright crisis. Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia, describes the administration as challenging the courts thus far up to a point. “I don’t want to call it a constitutional crisis because I’m waiting to see them say in their own words, ‘We will not comply with court orders anymore,’” says Frost, who is the director of UVA’s Immigration, Migration, and Human Rights Program. “They have yet to say that. And while they’ve done some things to violate corners of the margins, they have so far followed along.” She adds, “I’m very concerned and think they’re being very disingenuous…but I would not say that they have yet crossed the line of suggesting they no longer feel that they need to abide by the rule of law.” Yet signs of open defiance are emerging. White House officials have said the judge’s order came after planes carrying the Venezuelan migrants had already left the U.S. Tom Homan, Trump’s White House “border czar,” dismissed the weekend’s rulings, telling Fox News on Monday that the court orders had come too late to make a difference.\n\n“We’re not stopping,” Homan said. “I don’t care what the judges think.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked to clarify those comments Monday afternoon, insisted that the Administration is complying with the court order, even though the planes with Venezuelan deportees landed in El Salvador hours after the judge gave verbal instructions to Justice Department attorneys that the flights must return to the U.S. “We are quite confident in that, and we are wholly confident that we are going to win this case in court,” Leavitt told reporters. She also said there are “questions about whether a verbal order carries the same weight as a … written order.” Federal judges are now weighing how to respond to cases that may end up before the Supreme Court. Judge Boasberg scheduled a Monday evening hearing to determine whether the administration defied his ruling. In Massachusetts, Judge Leo T. Sorokin has demanded an explanation from the government for why Dr. Alawieh was deported in apparent violation of his order.\n\nThe Administration says it invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798—a wartime law rarely used in modern history—to deport Venezuelans who the government say belong to the Tren de Aragua gang, without due process. Federal courts have repeatedly ruled against the administration’s use of emergency powers, including on immigration and border security, yet officials have continued to push forward in ways that some see as ignoring or undermining the judiciary’s authority. In the case of Dr. Alawieh, who is Lebanese, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that she “openly admitted” to CBP officers her support for a Hezbollah leader and attended their funeral. “A visa is a privilege not a right—glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied,” the statement said. “This is commonsense security.” The official White House account on X said: “Bye-bye, Rasha” with a hand waving emoji. Alawieh was sent back to Lebanon, even though the judge ordered on Friday that she be kept in the U.S. and brought to a court hearing on Monday.\n\nLegal scholars warn that if courts allow such defiance to go unpunished, the judiciary’s ability to serve as a check on executive power could be permanently weakened. “There is an accumulation of power in one place,” Wehle says. “That means Donald Trump becomes the law. The law is what he sees the law to be. He picks and chooses winners and losers.”\n\n\n\n“The checks and balances are gone,” she adds.\n\nThe Trump Administration is working aggressively to shape public perception of both the deportations and its defiance of the courts as wins for the American people. Social media posts from administration officials and pro-Trump influencers have celebrated the deportations. One post showed a video of shackled men being led onto the planes, accompanied by Semisonic’s 1998 song “Closing Time.”",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "BUDAPEST, Hungary — Hungarian lawmakers on Tuesday passed a law banning Pride events and allowing authorities to use facial recognition software to identify attendees, continuing a crackdown by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s right-wing populist party on the country’s LBGTQ+ community. The measure passed in a 136-27 vote. The law, supported by Orbán’s Fidesz party and their minority coalition partner the Christian Democrats, was pushed through parliament in an accelerated procedure after being submitted only a day earlier.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt amends Hungary’s law on assembly to make it an offense to hold or attend events that violate Hungary’s contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors under 18. Attending a prohibited event will carry fines up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546), which the state must forward to “child protection,” according to the text of the law. Authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify individuals attending a prohibited event. As the vote was held in Hungary’s parliament in Budapest, opposition lawmakers ignited smoke bombs in the chamber, filling it with thick plumes of colorful smoke. Read more: What Trump’s Win Means for LGBTQ+ Rights In a statement on Monday after lawmakers first submitted the bill, Budapest Pride organizers said the aim of the law was to “scapegoat” the LGBTQ+ community in order to silence voices critical of Orbán’s government.\n\n“This is not child protection, this is fascism,” organizers wrote. “The government is trying to restrict peaceful protests with a critical voice by targeting a minority. Therefore, as a movement, we will fight for the freedom of all Hungarians to demonstrate!” The new legislation is the latest step against LGBTQ+ people taken by Orbán, whose government has passed other laws that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities. In 2022, the European Union’s executive commission filed a case with the EU’s highest court against Hungary’s 2021 child protection law. The European Commission argued that the law “discriminates against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.” Hungary’s government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilization from what it calls “gender madness,” and argues that its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda.”\n\nRead more: Anti-LGBTQ+ Policies Have an Alarming Effect on Youth Mental Health\n\nHungary’s “child protection” law — aside from banning the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality in content available to minors, including in television, films, advertisements and literature — also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programs, and forbids the public depiction of “gender deviating from sex at birth.”\n\nIn a speech in February, Orbán hinted that his government would take steps to ban the Budapest Pride event, which attracts thousands and celebrates the history of the LGBTQ+ movement while asserting the equal rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nAnother Pride event in the southern Hungarian city of Pécs has also been held in recent years. Budapest Pride is marking its 30th anniversary this year, and is scheduled to take place on June 28.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "The Trump Administration has transferred hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations under an 18th century wartime declaration targeting Venezuelan gang members, officials said Sunday. Flights were in the air at the time of the ruling. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg issued an order Saturday temporarily blocking the deportations, but lawyers told him there were already two planes with immigrants in the air — one headed for El Salvador, the other for Honduras. Boasberg verbally ordered the planes be turned around, but they apparently were not and he did not include the directive in his written order.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRead More: Trump Invokes 18th Century Law to Speed Deportations, But a Judge Stalls It Hours Later White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement Sunday, responded to speculation about whether the Administration was flouting court orders: “The Administration did not ‘refuse to comply’ with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory.” The acronym refers to the Tren de Aragua gang, which Trump targeted in his unusual proclamation that was released Saturday In a court filing Sunday, the Department of Justice, which has appealed Boasberg’s decision, said it would not use the Trump proclamation he blocked for further deportations if his decision is not overturned. Trump sidestepped a question over whether his administration violated a court order while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday evening.\n\n“I don’t know. You have to speak to the lawyers about that,” he said, although he defended the deportations. “I can tell you this. These were bad people.” Asked about invoking presidential powers used in times of war, Trump said, “This is a time of war,” describing the influx of criminal migrants as “an invasion.” Trump’s allies were gleeful over the results. “Oopsie…Too late,” Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who agreed to house about 300 immigrants for a year at a cost of $6 million in his country’s prisons, wrote on the social media site X above an article about Boasberg’s ruling. That post was recirculated by White House communications director Steven Cheung. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who negotiated an earlier deal with Bukele to house immigrants, posted on the site: “We sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars.”\n\nSteve Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, said that Boasberg’s verbal directive to turn around the planes was not technically part of his final order but that the Trump Administration clearly violated the “spirit” of it. “This just incentivizes future courts to be hyper specific in their orders and not give the government any wiggle room,” Vladeck said. The immigrants were deported after Trump’s declaration of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has been used only three times in U.S. history. The law, invoked during the War of 1812 and World Wars I and II, requires a president to declare the United States is at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners who otherwise would have protections under immigration or criminal laws. It was last used to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II. Venezuela’s government in a statement Sunday rejected the use of Trump’s declaration of the law, characterizing it as evocative of “the darkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.”\n\nTren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation’s economy came undone during the past decade. Trump seized on the gang during his campaign to paint misleading pictures of communities that he contended were “taken over” by what were actually a handful of lawbreakers. The Trump Administration has not identified the immigrants deported, provided any evidence they are in fact members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the United States. It also sent two top members of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang to El Salvador who had been arrested in the United States. Video released by El Salvador’s government Sunday showed men exiting airplanes onto an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down to have them bend down at the waist.\n\nThe video also showed the men being transported to prison in a large convoy of buses guarded by police and military vehicles and at least one helicopter. The men were shown kneeling on the ground as their heads were shaved before they changed into the prison’s all-white uniform—knee-length shorts, T-shirt, socks and rubber clogs—and placed in cells. The immigrants were taken to the notorious CECOT facility, the centerpiece of Bukele’s push to pacify his once violence-wracked country through tough police measures and limits on basic rights The Trump Administration said the president actually signed the proclamation contending Tren de Aragua was invading the United States on Friday night but didn’t announce it until Saturday afternoon. Immigration lawyers said that, late Friday, they noticed Venezuelans who otherwise couldn’t be deported under immigration law being moved to Texas for deportation flights. They began to file lawsuits to halt the transfers.\n\n“Basically any Venezuelan citizen in the US may be removed on pretext of belonging to Tren de Aragua, with no chance at defense,” Adam Isacson of the Washington Office for Latin America, a human rights group, warned on X. The litigation that led to the hold on deportations was filed on behalf of five Venezuelans held in Texas who lawyers said were concerned they’d be falsely accused of being members of the gang. Once the act is invoked, they warned, Trump could simply declare anyone a Tren de Aragua member and remove them from the country. Boasberg barred those Venezuelans’ deportations Saturday morning when the suit was filed, but only broadened it to all people in federal custody who could be targeted by the act after his afternoon hearing. He noted that the law has never before been used outside of a congressionally declared war and that plaintiffs may successfully argue Trump exceeded his legal authority in invoking it.\n\nThe bar on deportations stands for up to 14 days and the immigrants will remain in federal custody during that time. Boasberg has scheduled a hearing Friday to hear additional arguments in the case.\n\nHe said he had to act because the immigrants whose deportations may actually violate the U.S. Constitution deserved a chance to have their pleas heard in court.\n\n“Once they’re out of the country,\" Boasberg said, \"there’s little I could do.\"\n\n—Cano reported from Caracas, Venezuela.",

        "source": "https://time.com/",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel — The relative calm of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came to an abrupt end on Tuesday, when Israel launched dozens of attacks on targets across the Gaza Strip. Palestinian hospital officials say more than 400 people have been killed, including women and children. Israel says the operation is open-ended and expected to expand, raising fears of the 17-month-old war fully reigniting. Here's what to know about how the strikes came about and what might come next.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat happened to the ceasefire? The ceasefire agreed to in mid-January was a three-phase plan, the first of which actually ended two weeks ago. Israel balked at entering substantive negotiations over the second phase, which were meant to lead to a long-term ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the return of all hostages taken by Hamas in its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that started the war. The ceasefire was supposed to continue as long as talks over the second phase went on, according to the agreement reached after more than a year of negotiations mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. During the first phase, Hamas returned 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces also withdrew to buffer zones inside Gaza, and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians returned to northern Gaza. No further hostage releases were called for under the agreement until the second phase.\n\nHundreds of aid trucks had been entering daily. But two weeks ago, Israel cut off all food, medicine, fuel, electricity and other supplies to the territory’s around 2 million people to pressure Hamas to accept a new proposal. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase. Hamas refused the new proposal, accusing Israel of trying to sabotage the existing agreement. Is the ceasefire over? Unless mediators step in, Israel's surprise attack could mean a full return to fighting in a 17-month war that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly threatened to resume the war, said he ordered the strikes because of Hamas' rejection of the new proposal. He said Israel “will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength.\"\n\nThe White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel’s actions. Hamas accused Netanyahu of upending the ceasefire agreement and exposing the remaining hostages ”to an unknown fate.” In a statement, it called on mediators to hold Israel “fully responsible for violating and overturning the agreement.” The attack came during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. No major fighting has occurred in Gaza since the ceasefire took hold on Jan. 19, but Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military said had entered unauthorized areas, engaged in militant activities or otherwise violated the truce. What is Netanyahu's situation? Netanyahu has come under mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel’s internal security agency. Families of hostages still held in Gaza expressed concern Tuesday over their loved ones. “We are shocked, angry, and terrified by the deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas,” the Hostages Families Forum said.\n\nBut Netanyahu has also faced demands from his hard-line allies not to allow any deal in Gaza that falls short of Hamas' destruction. Negotiations with Hamas over a second phase could have brought pressure for compromises over how Gaza will be ruled in the future. Netanyahu needs to meet an end-of-the-month deadline for passing a budget or his government will collapse and the country would be forced into early elections. He has struggled to reach an agreement with coalition partners. Resuming the war could lure back former Cabinet minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, and give the prime minister added support for what is expected to be a tight vote. Netanyahu's critics have also alleged his firing of the security agency chief and a string of other dismissals are part of a broader campaign aimed at undermining independent government institutions. They say he’s doing this to maintain power while on trial for alleged corruption and facing public pressure to accept his own responsibility for policy failures in the lead-up to Hamas' surprise attack on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nWhat else is happening?\n\nA resumption of fighting in Gaza could have repercussions around the region.\n\nYemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels denounced the Israeli strikes, saying “the Palestinian people will not be left alone in this battle\" — indicating a possible resumption of the Houthis' strikes on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nThe United States launched a new airstrikes over the weekend targeting the Houthis in Yemen in retaliation for its attacks on shipping. At least 53 people were reported killed. ore.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Monday warned Iran would “suffer the consequences” for any further Houthi attacks, threatening to widen the conflict further.\n\nNew Gaza violence could also shake the ceasefire that Israel reached with Hezbollah in November, which stopped months of deadly exchanges of fire over the Israeli-Lebanon border.\n\n___\n\nRising reported from Bangkok.

Where’s my milk?” she says. “I remember standing naked in the shower, and my sister helped me. She was my source of strength. She’d had five children—she had the wisdom to pass on.”\n\nKidman and I are curled up in chairs beside a fireplace inside a historic Nashville home, not far from the house the Oscar winner shares with her husband Keith Urban, their two daughters, and a serene poodle named Julian. Kidman is warm and disarmingly inquisitive: she wants to hear about my postpartum experience too.\n\nPerhaps I shouldn’t be surprised by the ease of this conversation about vulnerable moments in our lives as women. Kidman, 57, has emotionally exposed herself on screen for decades. On the drama Big Little Lies, she huddled under a towel between shooting scenes of domestic violence. In her latest film, Babygirl, she growled while masturbating on the floor. She marks all her scripts with notes about her characters, coded for privacy. Then she shreds them: “It’s too personal. I want it gone.”\n\nPhotograph by Petra Collins for TIME\n\nBuy your copy of the Women of the Year issue, featuring Nicole Kidman here\n\nFilmmakers adore her rawness. “People believe if you have power, you don’t have to go to a place of vulnerability,” says Oscar-winning director Jane Campion, Kidman’s longtime friend. “A lot of actors won’t do that because it’s uncomfortable.” For Kidman to be truly open with a director requires a leap of faith. She describes herself as trusting to a fault. “It’s how I approach all of my relationships. I’ve been hurt because of that, but I’m still not jaded,” she says. “I’m delicate, but I’m very giving. The emotions I offer are very, very real, so I need to know that if I’m giving that to you, you value it.”\n\nShe has found that women behind the camera often offer a support reminiscent of how her sister cared for her in those early days after childbirth. And Kidman has made it her mission to use her immense star power to shine a light on emerging directors like Halina Reijn, who helmed the bold Babygirl, about a CEO who submits to an intern in a dominant-submissive affair. Many actors called out the dearth of opportunities for female filmmakers in the #MeToo era, but few followed through on promoting talent. Kidman pledged in 2017 to work with a woman director every 18 months. She has far exceeded her promise, partnering as a producer and actor with 19 in film and TV over the past eight years.\n\nIn 2023, fewer than 15% of films released theatrically were directed by women. For those who do receive funding and support, Kidman says, there’s undue pressure to “be perfect” on the first outing. “It can be changed,” she says, “but it can only be changed by actually being in the films of women.”\n\nWith curly, strawberry-blonde hair and a preternaturally intense stare, Kidman stood out among the 14-year-olds in the Sydney-area youth acting school that a 27-year-old Campion once visited to cast her student film. Kidman won the part but dropped out, fearing she’d look silly in the stocking she had to wear on her head for the costume—now one of her biggest regrets. But the two stayed in touch, and Kidman consulted Campion after making the jump to Hollywood where, at first, her newsmaking marriage to Tom Cruise in 1990 threatened to overshadow her work.\n\n“By the time she was married to Tom, people in America didn’t understand Nicole had a whole career in Australia that was revered,” Campion recalls. “They just thought she was riding on his career. She was in despair about the roles she was being offered, and wondering how she could change her trajectory.” Kidman jumped at opportunities to work with directors she admired. A series of performances in the late 1990s, in Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady, and Sam Mendes’ staging of The Blue Room in London, proved her bona fides.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman has since worked with auteur after auteur. When certain directors call, she doesn’t even read the script before saying yes: she gleefully signed onto Lars von Trier’s 2003 avant-garde thriller Dogville; Yorgos Lanthimos’ unsettling 2017 drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer; and Robert Eggers’ bloody 2022 fable, The Northman.\n\nAnd, of course, Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. Reijn has said that Babygirl was, in part, inspired by Kidman’s performance. In the 1999 movie, her character shares a sexual fantasy that triggers a crisis of masculinity for her husband, played by Cruise. Reijn fantasized about Kidman’s character carrying out the imagined affair. It’s the kind of evolution Kidman hopes to encourage by opening doors for women: “Stanley was dealing with it from the male perspective, and Halina chose to reinterpret it as a woman.”\n\nBabygirl, released on Christmas, capped a year of stories about women’s sexuality in midlife. Miranda July’s best seller All Fours, the Anne Hathaway romance The Idea of You, the Laura Dern movie Lonely Planet, and another Kidman project, A Family Affair, all featured women in their 40s and 50s entangled with younger lovers. “It’s always been there—it just hasn’t been told. Maybe it’s threatening,” Kidman says. But she is, as TIME’s film critic Stephanie Zacharek posited in her Babygirl review, in her “don’t give a f-ck” era. Kidman doesn’t swear, but she admits, giggling, that the sentiment resonates. “I have the philosophy to never fight anything,” she says. “Surrender.”\n\nShe’s come a long way from the teen who was embarrassed to wear a stocking on her head, Campion says. “That was a lesson to her later: be brave.”\n\nWhen we meet, Kidman has spent the previous day filming the crime series Scarpetta with Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis in Nashville and will fly to Berlin in the evening to wrap Season 2 of Nine Perfect Strangers before turning around to promote Mimi Cave’s thriller Holland at SXSW in Austin in March. Last year alone, she starred in A Family Affair, the Lulu Wang–directed Expats, Susanne Bier’s beach-set The Perfect Couple, and the CIA drama Lioness—all before Babygirl hit theaters.\n\nPetra Collins for TIME\n\nKidman is able to partner with so many female directors in part because she never stops working. “People go, ‘You’re a superwoman,’” Kidman says. “I hate it.” She doesn’t feel super—she gets fatigued like anyone else—but she’s a lifelong people pleaser. She fretted over bringing home perfect grades. If she can’t think of the exact right response to a text, she’ll ignore it for weeks. She’s often compelled to say yes to roles because doing so creates jobs. “People work when Nicole works,” Curtis says. “I’m working because Nicole is working.”\n\nAnd she knows it’s a privilege. She remembers times when she contemplated quitting: “When there was nothing exciting or relevant coming my way, when there was massive criticism or bullying, when your self-esteem is shattered, when you’ve been hit with some massive loss or grief and go, ‘I don’t want to get out of bed. It’s too frightening.’”\n\nCampion has witnessed Kidman pull herself out of moments of strife. “She’s always been a star, and that star has come up and come down, but Nicole knows that in itself is not what makes her happy. What makes her happy is her work.”\n\nKidman has been on a run of producing and starring in projects about privileged matriarchs whose lives unravel when a secret comes to light. It’s not that she’s particularly attracted to her glamorous yet guarded characters—those just happen to be the stories that get greenlighted. “I am so open to starting something completely a mess and shattered,” she says. “Where is it? Give me the material.”\n\nBut the part works. Audiences eat up her rich, icy characters. Campion, art house to the core, concedes there’s value in Kidman’s ability to tap into a hungry, predominantly female audience. “You can’t have power without being commercial,” she says. “You have to make money. Women want material that fits them, not just macho superheroes.”\n\nAnd there’s something deceptively progressive in those stories. Prestige roles for women often involve playing the supportive wife. But in her projects, Kidman is the star, with accomplished male actors—Alexander Skarsgard, Liev Schreiber, Antonio Banderas—bolstering her performances. When she says her onscreen husbands have been egoless, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow. “I’ve worked with some of the greatest male actors in the world, and they’ve been so generous. All of them. Is that crazy?” Kidman laughs. She wasn’t intending to flip a trope on its head. She just did it.\n\n—\n\nStyled by Stella Greenspan; hair by Italo Gregorio; make-up by Gucci Westman; production by Perfect Projects.",

        "content": "Severe thunderstorms intensified and impacted much of the Midwest region on Friday and into Saturday, with more instances of extreme weather expected throughout the weekend. In an update shared on Saturday morning, the National Weather Service warned that an \"outbreak of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms [are] expected over parts of the Deep South and Tennessee Valley today into tonight.\" With a vast swath of the U.S. experiencing extreme weather, and storm warnings in place across various states, American Red Cross and other organizations are encouraging people to prepare themselves.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n“If you're prepared in advance, you're going to be more comfortable to respond when an emergency does happen. You'll be in the know of what needs to get done,” Stephanie Fox, media relations lead at American Red Cross, tells TIME. Amid rising concerns, here are the best ways to prepare for a storm. Secure your home Before a storm, try to trim trees and cut down branches near your home. By removing branches that are likely to break or fall during a storm, you can prevent them from damaging homes, vehicles, power lines, or causing injuries. Further, it can help prevent a tree from becoming uprooted and falling during a storm, and makes the cleanup post-storm less chaotic. Beyond trees outside the home, the National Weather Service suggests that those preparing for a storm “secure loose objects, close windows and doors, and move any valuable objects inside or under a sturdy structure.” Effort to stay updated\n\nThose within an affected-area of a severe storm can stay updated with the forecasted storm, its intensity and movement through multiple avenues, whether that be through NOAA Weather Radio, The Emergency Alert System (EAS), or their local weather channel. Oftentimes, communities have specific ways to send warnings, from outdoor sirens to alerts via smartphones. By learning how your community alerts residents to severe incoming weather—including warnings for storms and tornados tornados—you can make sure you stay updated in real-time. Fox notes that people need to make sure their updates do not just go off during the day, but at night too. “People don't always consider that they need to have something that's going to wake them up,” she says, adding that the NOAA Weather Radio is programmed to emit “a very loud buzzing noise that will absolutely wake up a household in the event that a warning is issued.”\n\nClean your gutters During a storm, you want your gutters to move as much water as possible, as easily as possible. The best way to ensure this is to clean your gutters prior to the storm hitting, in order to prevent water build-up during the weather event—at which point it likely wouldn’t be safe to go outside and clear any blockages. Water build-up can cause damage to home roofs, and create leaks and structural damage to your home.\n\nA man cleans his house gutters before a storm comes. Nattrass—Getty Images\n\nBuild an emergency kit To prepare for a storm—and the days after a storm passes, in which necessities like electricity may still be out—it’s a good idea to build an emergency kit to help you and your loved ones power through. A disaster supply kit includes basic items that your household may need.\n\nAccording to Ready.gov, a national public service campaign formed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dedicated to educating Americans to prepare for and mitigate emergencies, a disaster kit should include water, food, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a mask, garbage bags, a whistle, a can opener, a cell phone with extra chargers and batteries, and more. You can read the full list here. After assembling the kit, Ready.gov recommends keeping canned food in a dry place and storing boxed food in tightly closed plastic or metal containers in order to ensure they remain edible, should a severe weather event or disaster strike. They also recommend keeping a kit in your car, in case you ever become stranded. Per Fox, it’s vital to have a “stay-at-home kit” that allows a household to navigate about two weeks in the house under emergency circumstances, and then a “to-go kit” that people can use if they have to evacuate, which should have enough resources to cover three-to-five days.\n\nLightning brightens the night sky as storms continue to cross the region on Aug. 23, 2024 near Shiprock, New Mexico. David McNew—Getty Images\n\nLocate the nearest shelter According to the CDC, one way to prepare yourself in the event of severe thunderstorms is to locate your nearest shelters ahead of time and map out the safest routes to reach them. “If [people] live in mobile homes or campers, those are not safe when we get these types of outbreaks,” Fox says. “So it's really important for folks to identify if they have a community shelter. Maybe they can visit friends or family overnight.” The idea is to be out of harm’s way when the peak of the threat is expected. According to Randy Bowers, meteorologist at the National Weather Service, this also means planning for which room in your shelter or home will best protect you in the event of a bad storm—especially as large hail storms mean people should stay away from windows.\n\n“[The safest room] is usually the lower floor of your house. If you have a basement, that's ideal. But if you don't, then [aim for] the lower floor in an interior room,” he says. “The idea is to put as many walls between you and the weather outside as you possibly can, and to stay away from windows.” Make your pets a part of the plan If you have animals or pets, Fox says that they should be embedded in your family’s emergency plan. Make sure their carriers and leashes are accessible, so that when a severe storm—or other emergency— hits, pets can be evacuated with ease, if needed. “If they have any prescription medications, make sure you have an extra supply in your emergency kit—extra food, toys, just anything that your pet may need if you have to be confined to your home for a period of time, or if you have to evacuate,” she says. Fox also recommends making sure that pets are kept inside during storms, in case they get “spooked” by thunder and try to run away.\n\nConsider buying surge protectors\n\nAccording to FEMA’s preparedness sheet for thunderstorms, lightning, and hail, buying surge protectors, lightning rods, or a lightning protection system can help protect your home’s appliances and electronic devices in the event of lightning strikes during the storm.\n\nBowers says this can be a part of a “long-term plan,” and is something to think about especially if you currently live in, or are moving to, an area prone to storms.",

        "content": "Edward II: Did a gay love affair spark a 14th-Century royal crisis?\n\n27 February 2025 Share Save Nick Levine Share Save\n\nAlamy\n\nA new revival of Christopher Marlowe's pioneering play about the 14th-Century King of England puts the spotlight back on his relationship with his male \"favourite\" Piers Gaveston.\n\nThis week, at its base in Stratford-upon Avon, the world-famous Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) is opening a new production of Christopher Marlowe's Edward II. Though this influential 16th-Century play about a beleaguered queer monarch is more than 430 years old, it still feels stingingly relevant. Marlowe depicted a king whose authority and ability to rule is fatally undermined by his relationship with another man. Modern-day UK monarchs hold only ceremonial power, but overt queerness in the British royal family remains vanishingly rare. Lord Ivar Mountbatten, a second cousin of King Charles III who is currently competing on US reality show The Traitors, is widely described as \"the first openly gay royal\".\n\nMarlowe's play dramatises the struggles of Edward II, a real-life King of England who reigned from 1307 to 1327. A year after Edward II succeeded his father, Edward I, he married the King of France's daughter, Isabella, in an effort to strengthen Anglo-French relations. Queen Isabella bore Edward II four children, and became a formidable figure in her own right – she is sometimes called \"the she-wolf of France\". But Marlowe's play really hinges on the king's controversial relationship with his male \"favourite\", Piers Gaveston, and how this sparked a constitutional crisis that he never recovered from.\n\nAlamy A 19th-Century painting by Marcus Stone of Edward II and Gaveston, showing them getting closer while courtiers look on (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe playwright never says outright that the two men are lovers, but the queer subtext is hardly subtle. In one scene, after he is reunited with his favourite, Edward beseeches him to \"kiss not my hand [but] embrace me, Gaveston, as I do thee\". In another, Isabella bemoans the fact \"the king regards me not, but [instead] dotes upon the love of Gaveston\". Only a wilfully obtuse reader of Marlowe's text could miss the insinuation that these two men are more than just friends.\n\nWas Edward II gay?\n\nEver since it was written, Marlowe's play has helped to cement the real-life Edward's debatable but not entirely misleading reputation as a \"gay king\". To put it simply, we can never know for certain whether Edward II had a romantic and/or sexual relationship with any of his male favourites. But when it was first performed in 1592, it paved the way for the monarch's queerness to be openly discussed by historians. \"The earliest text we have accusing Edward of some kind of sexual transgression was written around the time Gaveston was murdered [in 1312],\" historian Kit Heyam, author of The Reputation of Edward II, 1305-1697, tells the BBC. \"It says that at the beginning of Edward's reign, there was 'much lechery habitually practised'.\"\n\nI think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay. But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay – Kathryn Warner\n\nIn the parlance of the time, \"lechery\" was used to describe any kind of \"sinful\" sexual behaviour, according to the mores of the Catholic Church, which held religious authority in England at the time. \"The text seems to be suggesting that this behaviour will stop now that Gaveston's dead, but it stops short of saying that the sexual transgression was actually between Gaveston and the king,\" Heyam says. In the centuries after Edward II's death, it became less risky for writers to insinuate that Edward II may have been sexually transgressive, but the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century cranked up the innuendo. \"Writers would sensationalise their texts to make them more commercially appealing, so they started saying that Edward II was definitely sexually transgressive, and it was definitely the fault of his male favourites,\" Heyam says. \"But Marlowe was the first person to join the dots, and say that Edward II was actually sleeping with them.\"\n\nThe actor and RSC co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who portrays Edward II in the new production, believes that Marlowe's play still feels \"radical\" in 2025. His interest in reviving it was piqued by director Daniel Raggett, who posed a \"provocative\", hypothetical question that underlines the piece's enduring relevance: \"What would happen if our current king, Charles III, suddenly said: 'I know I've been married for a while, but I actually want someone called Colin by my side, not Camilla?'\" It might not cause a civil war, as Edward's relationship with Gaveston begets in Marlowe's play, but Evans questions just how accepting today's \"supposedly liberal and permissive society\" would be. \"Deep-rooted homophobia still exists, and the whole notion of the British Royal Family, of lineage and heirs, is very dependent on a heteronormative family structure,\" he notes.\n\nHelen Murray The new RSC production of Edward II stars its co-artistic director Daniel Evans (pictured right), who believes the play is still radical (Credit: Helen Murray)\n\nEvans and Raggett were also intrigued by the play's late-20th-Century renaissance, which is inextricably linked with the burgeoning LGBTQ+ rights movement. Dr Will Tosh, head of research at Shakespeare's Globe, and author of Straight Acting: The Many Queer Lives of William Shakespeare, says that Marlowe's play \"doesn't have a hugely long performance history\" outside of the era in which it was written. He notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, it essentially went \"into cold storage\" because the idea of a male monarch having a male lover would have been anathema to conservative Georgian and Victorian audiences. The play's subsequent revival in the second half of the 20th Century coincides with a \"more curious and less judgmental attitude to queer intimacy\", Tosh says.\n\nBoundary-breaking productions\n\nIn 1969, two years after male homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales, but 11 years before the same advance was made in Scotland, Ian McKellen portrayed Edward II in a Prospect Theatre Company production that toured the UK. Gaveston was played by James Laurenson, a New Zealand actor who died last year, and their on-stage kiss caused some controversy when the production arrived in Edinburgh. \"The late councillor John Kidd took offence to this show of male affection, particularly as it took place on a stage erected within the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland,\" McKellen recalls on his website. Though a couple of local policemen were sent to watch the production, McKellen notes that they found \"no problem\" with its contents and this brief fuss \"guaranteed full houses for the run.\"\n\nWhen this production was broadcast on the BBC a year later, it made history by including the first same-sex kiss ever shown on British television. In a 2017 interview, McKellen said that the Prospect production also had a profound impact on \"many, many Americans\" who watched it on US network PBS. \"They saw for the first time in their lives two men kissing and couldn't believe it, but took comfort from it,\" he said.\n\nAlamy Ian McKellen and James Laurenson's same-sex kiss on stage in a 1960s production of the play, which was later televised on the BBC, was a landmark moment (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe play's place in the queer canon was further cemented by a 1991 film adaptation directed by artist and gay rights activist Derek Jarman. Featuring a deliberately anachronistic mix of modern and medieval props, costumes and backdrops, Jarman's film dials up Marlowe's homoeroticism, and reframes the story within the context of the contemporary LGBTQ+ rights movement. As Gaveston (played by Andrew Tiernan) is tortured for his transgressions, Jarman shows police clashing with protesters from gay-rights group OutRage!.\n\nA year before Jarman's film, Marlowe's play was staged by the RSC with Simon Russell Beale in the title role. Angela K Ahlgren argues in her 2011 essay Performing Queer Edward II in the 1990s that Jarman's film and this RSC revival of the play \"reflect notions of queerness circulating in the 1990s because they stage violence, same-sex desire, and references to contemporary gay political issues\". At the time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the gay male population globally, and queer activists in the UK were protesting against Section 28, a piece of legislation that prohibited the supposed \"promotion of homosexuality\" by schools and local councils. It had been enacted by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Government in 1988, following a rising tide of anti-gay sentiment in the media.\n\nFact v fiction\n\nStill, Marlowe's play should never be regarded as a work of historical gospel. Tosh says the playwright's \"major dramatic innovation\" is to make the king's relationship with Gaveston the \"central drama\" of his life by \"compressing the timeline\". In reality, Edward II cultivated relationships with other highly influential male favourites after Gaveston was murdered in 1312, just five years into his 19-year-reign. But Marlowe depicts his bond with Gaveston as by far the most emotionally significant. \"After Gaveston's death in the play, Edward invokes his memory to justify whatever he's doing. And later, when Edward is imprisoned and mistreated, he invokes Gaveston's name again as a plea for salvation,\" Tosh says.\n\nJoe Cocks Studio Collection/ Shakespeare Birthplace Trust Simon Russell Beale portrayed Edward II in the RSC's 1990 production, which reflected the era's gay politics (Credit: Joe Cocks Studio Collection/ Shakespeare Birthplace Trust)\n\nOf course, Marlowe's play also invites us to make serious presumptions about the nature of the two men's relationship. Historian Kathryn Warner, author of Edward II: The Unconventional King, says we can never know for certain how Edward II felt about Gaveston and his other male favourites because the king didn't keep a diary or write personal letters. \"All we have is the word of outsiders, which is obviously open to interpretation,\" she says. But in all likelihood, given that he fathered an illegitimate child with an unknown woman, Edward II's sexuality was probably more complicated than his reputation as a \"gay king\" might suggest. \"I think in purely physical terms, we could probably call him more bisexual than gay,\" Warner says. \"But emotionally, it strikes me that he probably was gay, because he was very, very close to his male favourites.\"\n\nI hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being – Daniel Evans\n\nThis closeness almost certainly caused his downfall. According to Heyam, Edward's fundamental error throughout his reign was to grant his favourites too much power. \"He failed to realise that being king of England in the 14th Century is very much a manager's job,\" they say. \"Edward needed to keep a number of powerful nobles happy, but when he gave Gaveston power over them, he made them very angry.\" After Gaveston was murdered by a group of rival barons in 1312, Edward II made the same mistake again with Hugh Despenser the Younger, whom Warner describes as \"the last and most powerful\" of his male favourites.\n\nIt's worth noting that Despenser does appear in Marlowe's play, but only as a relatively minor character called Spencer who is essentially a stand-in for Gaveston following his death. The real-life Despenser had much more agency. In 1324, amid growing tensions with France, he began to wield his influence against Queen Isabella because of her French heritage. Isabella fought back with support from her own favourite, Richard Mortimer, which ultimately led to Despenser's execution in 1325, and Edward II's forced abdication the following year. \"If he had just kept his public and private lives separate, he would probably have been fine,\" Heyam says.\n\nAlamy Celebrated gay British filmmaker Derek Jarman made a film of Edward II, that mixed medieval and modern settings (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIn Marlowe's play, the fallen monarch is killed at Mortimer's behest by a red hot poker through his anus. Warner says the idea that Edward II was murdered in this way is \"almost certainly a myth\" – one Marlowe didn't invent, but definitely helped to \"popularise\". Over 430 years later, it remains a shocking image with crassly homophobic overtones. But even if Marlowe's poker scene is apocryphal, the play still has a lot to say about the consequences of intolerance. When Edward complains about being forced to \"leave my Gaveston\", the disapproving Earl of Lancaster replies derisively: \"Diablo, what passions call you these?\" His use of the Spanish word for \"devil\" is surely no accident. \"I hope audiences who see this play think deeply about what happens when you try to ban love and sublimate someone's natural way of being,\" Evans says. \"The endless cycle of violence that this can create is something we can all learn from today.\"\n\nEdward II is at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until April 5, rsc.org.uk\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

In 1964, its director told the BBC why he broke every rule he could.\n\nJean-Luc Godard was crystal clear about what he planned to do with his feature-length film debut, Breathless (À bout de souffle), which was released 65 years ago this month. He wanted to blow up the whole idea of what cinema was. In 1964, the director told the BBC's Olivier Todd: \"It was a film which took everything the cinema had done – girls, gangsters, cars – exploded all this and put an end once and for all to the old style.\"\n\nStylish and semi-improvised, Breathless seemed revolutionary when it hit French screens on 16 March 1960. With its fragmented editing, offbeat dialogue and nonchalant approach to storytelling, it helped rewrite the language of modern cinema. As renowned US film critic Roger Ebert wrote: \"No debut film since Citizen Kane in 1942 has been as influential.\"\n\nWATCH: '[I protest] against everything, and especially against all the cinema'.\n\nOn its surface, Breathless's plot resembles that of a hard-boiled crime thriller. It tells the story of amoral, impulsive petty criminal Michel Poiccard (played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his doomed relationship with the enigmatic Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg), an American journalism student living in Paris. The film's plot plays out as Michel tries to evade arrest after murdering a policeman: he struggles to collect the money necessary to fund his escape and to convince the ambivalent Patricia to flee with him to Italy. But its director was not so much concerned with its crime narrative as he was with shattering cinematic conventions.\n\nBorn in 1930 to wealthy Franco-Swiss parents, Godard had spent the decade preceding Breathless's release immersed in cinema. At the beginning of the 1950s he had begun working as a film critic for the influential French magazine Cahiers du Cinéma. When he started, French cinema was dominated by studio-produced literary adaptations which valued polished storytelling over innovation. Godard, along with his fellow cinephiles at the magazine, railed against these films, arguing that they failed to capture any real emotion or show how people really behaved.\n\nAt the same time, US films that had been banned during the Nazi occupation were being shown in French cinemas. Following the Second World War, France had signed the Blum-Byrnes agreements which had opened up its markets to US products in return for eradicating its war debt. This led to a flood of US films that were enthusiastically embraced by these young French critics. They especially admired westerns and detective thrillers – genres they regarded as critically underappreciated. It was Italian-born French film critic Nino Frank who coined the term film noir or dark film. The Cahiers du Cinéma writers also revered film-makers who could stamp their own unique creative visions onto Hollywood productions, such as Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. They regarded these directors as the true \"auteurs\" or authors of those films, rather than the studio which produced them or the stars who appeared in them.\n\nWhen there is nothing useful left, we can start from scratch on fresh ground – Jean-Luc Godard\n\nThroughout the 1950s, these critics would debate and discuss the shortcomings of French cinema while developing their own ideas of what it should be. Many of the writers Godard worked alongside at Cahiers du Cinéma, such as François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol, would also end up becoming directors and leading proponents of the influential movement that would become known as La Nouvelle Vague (The New Wave).\n\nWith Breathless, Godard saw his chance to put the ideas he and his friends discussed into practice. He explained to the BBC in 1964 that he purposely set out to break rules he felt were holding back cinema. \"Conventions were exploded to make something with the remains, just as the debris is collected after an explosion. And when there is nothing useful left, we can start from scratch on fresh ground,\" he said.\n\nOut in the streets\n\nThe film's story was written by Truffaut, who based it loosely on a 1952 news article about a Paris criminal, Michel Portail. However, when Godard came to filming, he would pretty much abandon Truffaut's script. Instead, he got his actors to improvise scenes, or he would feed them lines from behind the camera while filming. This gave the dialogue a spontaneous and personal feel. But it meant that much of Breathless needed to be shot sequentially, so Belmondo and Seberg would know what had happened earlier in the story.\n\nDue to its limited budget, Godard's plan was to make the cheapest film possible. So instead of shooting in a studio where he would be able to control the lighting, the sound and the set, he took to the streets of Paris with his cinematographer, Raoul Coutard, who filmed on location using a lightweight handheld camera and relying on natural light. The camera, while portable and effective at filming in low-light conditions, was both noisy and unable to record synchronised sound. This meant that nearly all of the improvised lines of dialogue needed to be written down as Belmondo and Seberg ad-libbed, and then dubbed in post-production. This resulted in the later recorded dialogue often not matching the actors' lips, leading to debates that continue to this day about what the characters are actually saying.\n\nBecause much of Breathless's guerilla-style filming was done without permits or permission, random people going about their everyday lives in Paris's bustling streets and cafes were often captured in shot, lending an authenticity to its depiction of life in the city. Coutard had been a war photographer, and his reportage style of filming captured an immediacy and intimacy that made the film seem, at times, documentary-like. His camera moves restlessly around, capturing small everyday moments as the characters meet, talk and hang out. Sometimes the camera almost seems to be a participant in the action, sitting in the passenger seat of the car Michel has just stolen while he talks to it as if it were a friend. Breathless's lack of a conventional film crew added to its inventiveness. One of its most famous scenes, where Michel and Patricia are seen walking down the Champs-Élysées chatting as she advertises a newspaper, was achieved by Godard pulling Coutard along in a wheelchair while he filmed the actors walking towards him.\n\nIn History In History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\n\n\"The freedom of shooting on the Champs-Élysées, Jean Seberg walking down the curb with her unforgettable chanting, 'New York Herald Tribune'. It was like the invention of a mythology for me,\" the Italian director of Last Tango in Paris and The Last Emperor, Bernardo Bertolucci, told the BBC's The Film Programme in 2009.\n\nBut Godard wasn't trying to convince audiences that they were seeing unfiltered reality. He had been influenced by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht, who believed that a story could so absorb an audience that they became passive and unthinking. So, to keep viewers critically engaged, Brecht would remind them that they were watching a play and not real life.\n\nGodard embraced this idea, using a range of stylistic devices to make it impossible for viewers to forget that they were watching a film. Characters regularly break the fourth wall, addressing their dialogue directly to the audience. Often, they comment on their own situation, shaking the viewer's feeling of being an unseen spectator. And while a typical film's soundtrack subtly suggests the mood of a scene, in Breathless the music starts and stops suddenly, often disconnected from what is happening on screen at the time.\n\nNo easy answers\n\nBut it was Godard's rejection of the usual cinematic editing rules that would become the signature of the film. \"I was incredibly passionate about the style, the language of À bout de souffle,\" Bertolucci told the BBC. \"There were these jump cuts, for example. At school they were always telling you how to avoid jump cuts which were considered mistakes, and the movie was full of jump cuts.\"\n\nBreathless's use of jump cuts – abrupt transitions forward in time within the same scene – came about partly by accident. The finished film turned out to be much longer than intended, and Godard needed a way to cut it down to a manageable length. But instead of dropping whole scenes or sequences, the director chose to condense its running time by cutting out sections within takes. Often, he removes material from a continuous shot of movement or dialogue while making no attempt to match the edits, breaking the viewer's immersion in the film and giving it an energetic, skittish rhythm.\n\nAs a potential film-maker, it was like just being free, it was like being on a drug or something – Mike Hodges\n\nThis jittery editing style lent Breathless a feeling of unpredictability, grabbing the audience's attention and forcing them to be aware of the film-making process. Godard also did this by referencing other films, while at the same time subverting the very conventions that make those films work. Otto Preminger's 1950 film noir thriller Whirlpool is playing when Patricia enters a cinema in an effort to lose the police trailing her. In another scene, when she looks through a rolled-up poster at Michel, the shot mimics a scene in the western Forty Guns (1957) which is seen through a gun barrel. The admired French director of gangster films, Jean-Pierre Melville, has a cameo appearance playing a fictional celebrity author, while Godard himself crops up as a bystander on the street who recognises the fugitive Michel from the newspaper articles.\n\nIn another homage to Godard's influences, the protagonist, Michel, dresses like his hero Humphrey Bogart and practises trying to emulate his onscreen mannerisms. At one point, while gazing at the poster for Bogart's last film, The Harder They Fall (1956), he whispers \"Bogey\" in admiration. But Michel's behaviour, unlike that of a Bogart hero, comes across as neither heroic nor courageous. He displays no conscience over his crimes or remorse over his actions. His girlfriend, Patricia, who goes on to betray him to the police, could be seen as a classic femme fatale character, but instead of being driven by passion, their relationship seems oddly detached and her motives remain opaque. The meaning in Breathless is never simply spelt out for its audience, and its freewheeling plot and morally ambiguous characters provide no easy answers. The film leaves it to the viewer to come to their own interpretations and judgements.\n\nWith its distinctive storytelling, imaginative camerawork and photogenic young leads, who imbued it with an effortless sense of cool, Breathless was an immediate critical and commercial hit. It seemed to capture the mood of the times and people flocked to see it. \"They were in a sense ready for it,\" Professor James Williams told Kirsty Lang on the BBC's Last Word in 2022. \"I mean, people wanted something new and different.\" It would go on to win Godard the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 1960 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nFor the aspiring directors who saw Breathless, its effect was electric. \"As a potential film-maker, it was like just being free, it was like being on a drug or something. It was just amazing,\" Get Carter's director Mike Hodges told the BBC's The Film Programme in 2006.\n\n\"It broke all the rules – and rules of film-making are quite frightening in many ways. You've got to get the angles right, and you have lines that you don't cross. This was in the classical tradition. So in a sense, cinema was very like the classical painters, whereas when you saw Godard's film, it was like the impressionists coming to life, but on the screen.\"\n\nBreathless's impact would be felt in many of the US films that followed its release, with Godard influencing the Hollywood studios that had so affected him. Breathless's characters' moral ambiguity and its abrupt shifts in tone could be seen in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), its innovative camera angles and examination of relationship uncertainty were reflected in The Graduate (1967), and its low-budget filming techniques and improvised dialogue were embraced in Easy Rider (1969).\n\nThe Bob Dylan of cinema\n\nIn the 1970s, a slew of young directors inspired by the French New Wave, such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, would put their own singular \"auteur\" visions of cinema on the screen. The director Quentin Tarantino, who named his production company A Band Apart, after Godard's 1964 film Bande à part, has long acknowledged the effect the director had on him. He told Film Comment in a 1994 interview that \"Godard did to movies what Bob Dylan did to music: they both revolutionised their forms\".\n\nPart of Breathless's continuing influence on film-makers is in persuading them that it is possible for the viewer to do just what Godard did. As Shaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright wrote after Godard died in 2022: \"It was ironic that he himself revered the Hollywood studio film-making system, as perhaps no other director inspired as many people to just pick up a camera and start shooting.\"\n\n--\n\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the In History newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

The photo quickly went viral as it revealed the reality of Greenland's rapidly melting ice.\n\nIn June 2019, a striking image of husky dogs apparently walking on water in Greenland stunned the world and quickly went viral.\n\nThe photo was taken by Steffen Olsen, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute and lead of Blue Action, a European project which investigates the effect of a changing Arctic on weather and climate.\n\n\"The reaction surprised me,\" says Olsen. \"It surprised me that so many people saw this as a beautiful photo. I saw it as a scary situation.\"\n\nThat's because the dogs were in fact wading through ankle-deep meltwater on top of sea ice in Inglefield Bredning, an 80km-long (49.7 miles) system in northwestern Greenland.\n\n\"I learned to see the photo as an illusion. People don't see sea ice, but dogs walking on water,\" Olsen says.\n\nOlsen captured the photo while travelling with a team of scientists who were monitoring sea and ice conditions near the town of Qaanaaq, one of the world's most northerly towns. They were retrieving scientific instruments they had deployed during the winter.\n\n\"We had been travelling for some hours and it became clear that the melting was very extreme… [the ice] more or less melted beneath our feet while we were travelling on it,\" says Olsen. \"The local hunters and I were very surprised… we were searching for dry spots to get the dogs and the sleds out of the water and there were none in sight. We turned around and made it back to the coast.\"\n\nIt surprised me that so many people saw this as a beautiful photo. I saw it as a scary situation\n\nThe dogs are typically very hesitant to get their paws wet, says Olsen. \"Usually when we meet water, it's because there are cracks in the sea ice and the dogs have to jump over the water…they hate it. But it was actually very warm so I think they were happy to have cold feet,\" he says, adding that temperatures reached 14C (57F) on the day.\n\nThe scientists managed to retrieve their instruments a few days later once the water had drained away through small cracks in the ice sheet. \"Then you have a short period of time when you can then travel again before the ice collapses and breaks up,\" says Olsen.\n\nAlamy On average, Greenland loses 234 billion tonnes of ice per year (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOlsen says he was extremely surprised by the rapid melting he witnessed when he took the photo on 13 June 2019. He has only experienced such an extreme event once during his 15 years carrying out research in Greenland. It's unusual for melting to occur that quickly, Olsen explains.\n\n\"It requires a sudden onset of warm air while you still have fresh snow on the ice and solid sea ice. So it's an example of an extreme event developing early in the season... The local community have told me: 'you will have to wait 100 years to see [such an event] again'.\"\n\nMelting events such as the one Olsen witnessed would normally not occur until later in the season, in late June and July, but in 2019 melting started in mid-April, around six to eight weeks before the 1981-2020 average, and affected roughly 95% of Greenland's ice sheet, according to the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nSuch early melting events can have a \"snowball effect\" and lead to more melting as there is less snow and ice to reflect the Sun's rays back into space and keep the surface cool, explains Bianca Perren, a paleoclimatologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who studies sediment cores from polar regions to understand the long-term variability of the climate.\n\nGreenland experienced record ice loss in 2019, shedding a total of 532 billion tonnes from its giant ice sheet, according to a 2020 study. On average, Greenland loses 234 billion tonnes of ice per year – enough to pack into 6,324 Empire State Buildings.\n\n\"2019 was a really unusually warm year, but so was 2012,\" says Kelly Hogan, a marine geophysicist at BAS who studies the impacts of Greenland's melting ice sheet. In 2012, the summer period (June-August) was more than 2C (4F) warmer than the average for 1981-2010, and more than 1.5C (3F) warmer for the entire ice sheet. \"Those extremes are coming round more frequently than we had thought they would. They're happening every few years,\" says Hogan.\n\n\"What's really distinctive about Greenland is how much melting you get on the surface in the summer, because you don't get anywhere near as much as that in Antarctica,\" says Hogan. \"When you see huge volumes of water [on the ice], it is really shocking.\"\n\nBut it's rare to see \"giant pools of water\" on the surface like in Olsen's photo, says Perren, as usually the water seeps through cracks in the ice. \"It basically pops the ice sheet up and floats it out to the coast. So often you don't have this pooling of water, but instead you have warm water that's being sent down into the bowels of the Greenland ice sheet, basically warming the whole thing,\" she says.\n\nGetty Images Greenland's melting ice sheet is threatening local community's way of life (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe rapid melting of the ice is already affecting local communities' way of life. \"They are having to adapt the way they hunt and fish,\" says Olsen.\n\nIf the ice is unsafe to travel on, it also makes it more difficult for scientists to carry out their research, Olsen adds. \"We will have to adapt and rely more on automatic instruments instead of community-based monitoring.\"\n\nSafety is already a concern, says Perren, adding: \"I have promised my son that I will not step foot on the ice sheet because it's so dangerous.\"\n\nIt looks like the dogs are skating on something without a bottom… it feels like they could just sink at any moment – Kelly Hogan\n\nThe photo has helped raise awareness of Greenland's vulnerability to climate change, says Olsen. \"I have definitely found that you can get a lot of attention for the problem with a photo… so it has been very efficient.\n\n\"But I've also been challenged by people saying: 'how can you take a photo of climate change?' And I agree, you cannot take one photo and call it climate change, because that is something that unfolds over a longer time period,\" says Olsen. \"We need to explain the photo and provide the right context.\"\n\nPhotos are useful tools for starting conversation about the environment and explaining scientific phenomena, says Perren. \"Science has a communication problem,\" she says.\n\n\"When I first saw it in 2019 I remember thinking: 'oh my gosh, this is such a shocking image,'\" adds Perren. \"It's a symbolic image of what climate change looks like in Greenland. But there's also a scientific side to it: maybe this is unprecedented but it also [paints] a very good, kind of emblematic picture of what the future would look like.\"\n\nHogan says that photo \"really drives home the extent of the problem\". \"It looks like the dogs are skating on something without a bottom… it feels like they could just sink at any moment, which is maybe some sort of metaphor for the ice sheet and the future.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

But now, the world's steepest cable car whisks travellers to the 430-person village.\n\nOn a freezing day in December 2024, I took a scenic three-hour train ride from Geneva to Lauterbrunnen, an Alpine village nestled between Interlaken and the Jungfrau massif in central Switzerland. I was now at the gateway to the car-free mountain hamletof Mürren.\n\nFor most of Mürren's history, residents would lead their mules three hours down to gather essential supplies in the valley before trekking back up. Then in 1891, a narrow-gauge railway opened, connecting Mürren to the nearby mountain village of Grütschalp and a funicular that reached Lauterbrunnen. In 1965, a single-track cableway opened that could ferry residents down to another traffic-free village, Gimmelwald, above the valley.\n\nBut the day I arrived, this formerly secluded 430-person hamlet perched 1638m in the Bernese Oberland became directly connected with the outside world and valley below through the opening of the world's steepest cable car: the Schilthornbahn, which whisks travellers 775m up through some of the Swiss Alps' most jaw-dropping scenery in just four minutes.\n\nSchilthorn Cableway Ltd The world's steepest cableway now connects the medieval village of Mürren with the valley below (Credit: Schilthorn Cableway Ltd)\n\nAfter arriving at the Stechelberg car park, I was soon being hoisted from the valley floor up in a glass-enclosed cabin, staring down towards the storybook cottages below and surrounded by craggy mountains and snow-covered pines. The trip up the vertical Mürrenfluh rockface was so smooth that I barely noticed the 159.4% gradient (the world's previous steepest cable car, the Loen Skylift in Norway, rises 133%), until my ears started to pop.\n\nPerched on a natural terrace at the foot of the Schilthorn summit (2970m) overlooking the Lauterbrunnen valley, Mürren is a 13th-Century village with traditional stone and timber cottages that looks like it's clinging to the edge of a cliff. Because of its unique position, engineers have never been able to connect it to the outside world by road.\n\n\"Taking the cable car to school might seem unusual to many, but it was an everyday ritual for me,\" said Mürren native Michael Abegglen. \"Most everyday necessities and services are available in Mürren, but every time we need a doctor, hairdresser or dentist, we need to go down to the valley where many of us have our cars parked.\"\n\nAccording to Abegglen, the village's few year-round residents have long relied on one another. \"When you grow up here like I did, you know almost everyone, and there's a strong close-knit community,\" Abegglen adds. \"Some guests are like locals, as they return to Mürren every single year.\"\n\nAlamy Mürren is located in a stunning setting nestled in the Swiss Alps (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAfter checking into the Hotel Alpenruh, and admiring the awe-inspiring, 360-degree views of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau peaks from my balcony, I soon discovered that – unsurprisingly – this pocket-sized, car-free village is best explored on foot.\n\nMürren's few streets are lined with cosy inns; rustic restaurants serving Alpine cheeses and dry sausages; bars offering evening aperitifs; and quaint souvenir shops selling postcards, fine Swiss chocolates, cuckoo clocks and cowbells. One of Mürren's main landmarks is the Hotel Mürren Palace, built in 1874 and nicknamed \"Switzerland's first palace\" after its history of hosting celebrity skiers and Hollywood actors like Rita Hayworth. Oozing elegance and grandeur, its ballroom served as a meeting point for high society back in the 20th Century. As the snow fell, I popped into the pub at the Eiger Guesthouse to warm up over a mug of glühwein (traditional mulled wine).\n\nDespite its diminutive size, Mürren is a major winter sports hub. This former sleepy Walser settlement transformed in the late 1800s when British skiers discovered the village and fell in love with its scenery (and slopes).\n\n\"My great-grandfather Henry Lunn first came to Mürren in the 1890s and was smitten by its breathtaking beauty,\" said Bernard Lunn, a self-proclaimed \"ski bum\" and village resident. \"He soon started bringing British tourists here to witness the glorious 'triumvirate' of [the] Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau peaks. Later, my mountaineer grandfather Arnold Lunn and his wife Mabel started living here, and in 1922, Arnold founded the [world's] first slalom ski races. Mabel and a group of British Women established the Ladies' Ski Club here as well.\"\n\nAlamy Mürren's car-free streets are lined with cosy inns, restaurants and ski rental outfitters (Credit: Alamy)\n\nArnold's arrival also paved the way for the formation of the Kandahar Ski Club in 1924 and the inauguration of the country's first ski school in Mürren in 1930.A year later, the first Alpine World Ski Championships kicked off in this tiny town in February 1931.\n\nNearly a century later, the surrounding mountains are laced with 54km of fresh, powdery pistes connected through cable cars, funiculars and chairlifts. When snow conditions allow, you can ski 16km from the Schilthorn summit to the valley floor in Lauterbrunnen.\n\n\"A coffee at the peak and a trip down on skis with family and friends is how I love spending my winter days in Mürren,\" said Alan Ramsay, a sociable Scot who has called the village home for more than 25 years and helps organise the International Inferno, the world's biggest amateur ski race held in the town annually (21-24 January 2026).\n\nBut locals say there's more to Mürren than just skiing. From June through September, the area becomes a popular paragliding destination, offering magnificent birds-eye views over the region's soaring crags, turquoise lakes and more than 70 cascadingwaterfalls.You can also stroll the flower-studded trails and meadows dotted with grazing sheep.\n\nSchilthorn Cableway Ltd Mürren is also a popular paragliding and hiking destination (Credit: Schilthorn Cableway Ltd)\n\n\"The mountains are an ever-changing canvas,\" said Belinda Bühler, an avid trail runner who has lived her whole life in Mürren. \"In the winter, they wear a beautiful white coat. In the summer, the mood changes depending on whether we are having hot, rainy or foggy days. However, as winter slowly departs, you can already smell the scent of spring. As the earth starts to warm up, you see early summer blossoms and soon there are flower-filled meadows.\"\n\nBühler's main advice for those coming outside of ski season? \"Get out into nature onto the trails. You don't have to walk too far but as soon as you're on a trail, you're alone and can savour the stillness and beauty most palpably. The air is so pure and clean. I have grown up in Murren but I always call myself a local tourist, as I still tend to stop and take photos during my hikes. What I feel, see and hear on the trails in Mürren is indescribable!\"\n\nBernard's wife, Julia Lunn, who leads families and women on hikes in Murren added, \"People don't come here to shop or sightsee, but to experience life through skiing, snowshoeing, hiking, or simple pleasures like taking in the unrivalled views in solitude and dipping into the streams or the unspoiled Grauseeli lake.\"\n\nAt Ramsay's advice, I decided to experience one of those simple pleasures for myself. After grabbing a wooden sledge from the local Intersport rental shop, I took the funicular up to the Allmendhubel mountain station (the starting point of the infamous 3km Bob Chase featured in the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service). After a few quick practice runs, I whisked down the soft, powdery slopes of the Blumental Valley, peppered with pines and chalet-like holiday homes with a sense of wonder and a child-like grin plastered across my face.\n\nSchilthorn Cableway Ltd Attractions like the new Thrill Walk evoke a child-like sense of wonder (Credit: Schilthorn Cableway Ltd)\n\n\"When growing up in Mürren as a child, I didn't realise how lucky I was because I took [this] all for granted,\" said Bühler. \"As a teenager, I even found the village too small and limiting. However, after I travelled around a bit and returned to Murren, I fell in love with it all over again, especially with the sense of freedom it gave me. Today, I often feel speechless when I wake up here and find it hard to describe Mürren, because no words seem to do its beauty justice. It is a place that needs to be experienced and felt.\"\n\nEven after just a two-day visit, I think I know what she means.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

Here's what scientists say you can do about it.\n\nCarl Behnke had always wondered how clean his reuseable water bottle was. When he stuffed some paper towels inside and smeared them around, he was in for a shock.\n\n\"The towels were white – until I pulled them out,\" says Behnke, an expert in food safety at Purdue University in Indiana, US. \"I realised that the slippery sensation I felt in the interior of the bottle was not because of the material but rather because of a bacterial build-up.\"\n\nHis next step was to design a study. Behnke and colleagues stopped passers-by in a corridor at Purdue and asked if they would be happy to loan their water bottles to them as part of their research – to see how clean they were.\n\n\"One thing that stood out from the project was the number of people who didn't want to know the results,\" recalls Behnke. \"Basically, they knew that their cleaning habits were poor to non-existent – something the data later confirmed.\" The results confirmed that those bottles were brimming with bacteria.\n\nBut while they help people to stay hydrated, drinking from water bottles regularly, and taking them with us everywhere we go, may also pose health risks. So, should we ditch them, or can those risks be managed?\n\nWhat exactly is inside reusable water bottles?\n\nWhile it's usually safe to drink, water from our kitchen taps is not devoid of microbial life. This is why leaving water in your bottle for a few days will encourage bacteria to grow, says Primrose Freestone, associate professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Leicester, in the UK.\n\nBacteria that can cause human infections thrive at around 37C (98F) Freestone says, but can also multiply at room temperature, around 20C (68F).\n\n\"The longer water in a bottle is stored at room temperature, the more bacteria will grow,\" she says.\n\nOne study conducted in Singapore using boiled tap water – which should have killed most bacteria in it – found that bacteria populations can grow rapidly inside water bottles as they are used throughout the day. On average they found that water inside bottles used by adults went from having around 75,000 bacteria per millilitre in mid-morning to more 1-2 million per millilitre over the course of 24 hours.\n\nGorka Olmo Every sip you take from a water bottle or even a glass can leave microbes behind that mingle with those already in the liquid (Credit: Gorka Olmo)\n\nOne way to slow bacterial growth down is to store your bottle in the fridge between sips, Freestone says, though this doesn't stop it from growing altogether.\n\nBut while some of a water bottle's bacterial activity comes from the water itself, most contamination is actually introduced by the drinker. Whether you take your bottle to work, the gym, or even just keep it in the house, the outside of your bottle will carry many microbes. And these microbes are easily transferred into the contents of the bottle, along with bacteria from your mouth every time you take a sip, Freestone says.\n\nWater bottle users who don't wash their hands regularly will also find that their bottles can harbour bacteria such as E. coli, Freestone says.\n\n\"Poo-associated bacteria, such as E. coli, can come from our hands and end up on our lips if we're not good at toilet hygiene,\" she says.\n\nAnd we can pass on, or catch, viruses by sharing water bottles with others. Diseases such as norovirus could easily be passed on in this way.\n\nPeople generally have between 500 and 600 different species of bacteria living in their mouths says Freestone. \"What isn't necessarily disease-causing for you isn't always the case for others. You can carry an infection and not realise it, because our immune systems are so good at protecting us,\" she adds.\n\nAnother way you can encourage bacterial growth in your bottle is by putting anything other than fresh water in them. Drinks that nourish you also feed microbes – so any drinks containing sugar, for example, can stimulate the growth of any bacteria or mould present in your bottle, Freestone says.\n\n\"Anything other than water is heaven for bacteria and fungi, especially protein shakes,\" she says.\n\nIf you've ever left milk in a glass for a few hours, you may have noticed that it leaves behind a thin film on the glass when you pour it away. Bacteria happen to adore this film, Freestone says.\n\nHow can this bacteria affect us?\n\nWe are all surrounded by bacteria in the soil, air and on our bodies, but it's worth remembering that most bacteria are harmless or even beneficial.\n\nWater that's been contaminated with bacteria such as E. coli can cause diarrhoea and vomiting but not all the time. E. Coli are a large group of bacteria found naturally in the environment but also are common natural inhabitants of the human gut. It is only when the bacteria turn pathogenic – in other words they pick up certain traits that make them harmful – that they make people ill.\n\nBehnke and his colleagues also suggest using a dishwasher with a sanitisation cycle could be the most effective approach\n\nMost microbes aren't harmful to humans, but people whose immune systems are impaired can be more prone to infections, Freestone says.\n\nAlso, getting sick with a stomach bug can, in some cases, lead to long-term changes in the gut.\n\n\"Our guts are changing all the time, but there are over 1,000 species present in the gut so it's hard to shift in terms of composition,\" says Freestone. \"There are too many variables to say, but getting food poisoning from the bacteria in a water bottle will never lead to a positive change.\"\n\nPeople who've recently taken antibiotics that can affect their gut microbiome can also experience changes that leave them more vulnerable to other infections. One swab of a reusable water bottle taken at a newspaper office in the UK also revealed that these bottles can be a breeding ground for emerging strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Researchers discovered a species of bacteria called Klebsiella grimontii – which is capable of forming biofilms on otherwise sterile surface –in the sample taken from the water bottle. While it can be found as part of the normal microflora of the gastrointestinal tract, it can also cause severe diarrhoea in people who have recently taken antibiotics.\n\nIf mould or fungi grows in your bottle, this can trigger symptoms in anyone with allergies.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, there are no examples of severe illness that have been traced back to reusable water bottles in the scientific literature. This doesn't mean they don't happen, of course, as identifying single point sources of infection is notoriously difficult.\n\nHow should we clean reusable bottles?\n\nFor Behnke, it was the creeping sense that he should perhaps be cleaning his own water bottle more thoroughly that made him look closer at what could be inside it. He'd been using a filtered water bottle and had started to notice that the water he was drinking from it tasted bad.\n\n\"Every now and then I would flush it with hot water, but never really did anything more than that,\" he says.\n\nAfter his paper towel-based investigations revealed how manky his water bottle was, the study he and colleagues carried out went on to look at people's water bottle habits in greater detail.\n\nBehnke found that just over half of the 90 participants surveyed during the research said they share their bottle with others, and 15% said they never cleaned their bottles. Unsurprisingly, whether or not people rinsed or washed their water bottles affected the contamination level. However, Behnke found that how often they cleaned the bottles, or how they cleaned them, didn't enormously affect how contaminated the containers were.\n\nPeople who washed their bottle with tools such as a brush or used a dishwasher tended to have the lowest counts of bacteria inside. Behnke and his colleagues also suggest using a dishwasher with a sanitisation cycle could be the most effective approach.\n\nHowever, the study's conclusion states that these findings may have been skewed by the fact the researchers were relying on participants self-reporting their cleaning behaviours, and they may have changed their answers to appear more socially acceptable.\n\nThe study also found that bottles containing tea, coffee or juice were more contaminated than bottles that only contained water.\n\nGorka Olmo Storing your water bottle in the fridge between sips can be one way to slow down microbial growth (Credit: Gorka Olmo)\n\nCleaning our water bottles regularly and properly is the only way to be confident you are not consuming harmful bacteria alongside your water. Even if the water inside it is sterile, Freestone says, your saliva will end up in the bottle, along with trace levels of nutrients, which bacteria happily feed on.\n\nRinsing your bottle out with cold water isn't sufficient, Freestone says, because this won't get rid of biofilms – the slimy layer of bacteria that can build up on the inner surface of your bottle, which provides the perfect environment in which bacteria can thrive.\n\nFreestone recommends cleaning reusable bottles with hot water (over 60C (140F) as this temperature kills most pathogens), and using washing-up liquid – swirling it around, and leaving the bottle for 10 minutes before rinsing well with hot water.\n\nThen, allowing the bottle to air-dry is the best way to avoid a build-up of bacteria in your bottle, because microorganisms prefer moist environments.\n\nYou should clean your bottle this way after each use – or at the very least, several times a week, Freestone says. And never wait until it starts to smell, she warns.\n\n\"If your bottle starts to smell, you've reached a point where you should chuck it away,\" she says.\n\nOnce you have a nice, clean bottle, Freestone adds, remember to wash your hands before touching it.\n\nThe most hygienic bottles are simply those that are the easiest to clean\n\nBehnke, for one, is now a reformed water bottle-user. He washes and air dries his bottle every week using a bleach spray and bottle brush, which he uses to clean the spout or nozzles and other small surfaces.\n\nIs there any type of water bottle we should avoid?\n\nAlthough some studies have found that the bacterial load of plastic bottles can be higher than those of stainless steel bottles, the cleaning strategy used tends to make a far bigger difference. The most hygienic bottles are simply those that are the easiest to clean, Freestone says. It's important, she adds, to ensure you clean every part of the water bottle, including the outside, the lid and straw, if it has one.\n\nHowever, there may be another reason to opt for metal over plastic.\n\n\"Plastics usually have chemical additives that lend them their advantages: their flexibility, durability, heat-resistance and how lightweight they are,\" says Amit Abraham, assistant professor of clinical population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine in Qatar.\n\n\"These additives are physically bound to plastics, which means they can leach into the water,\" Abraham says,\n\nThey also appear to leach into water, Abraham says, regardless of whether the bottle is made of disposable or reusable plastic. Also, the plastic material itself can break down, increasing the concentration of microplastics in bottled water. Bottles made of glass or stainless steel may be safer alternatives.\n\nWhatever water bottle you opt for, it seems that good hygiene habits are fundamental to ensuring that the water you end up drinking isn't overflowing with harmful bacteria.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'\n\n1 day ago Share Save Dayna Camilleri-Clarke Share Save\n\nAlamy\n\nThe tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\n\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\n\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page, Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\n\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’s Blue Lagoon is a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\n\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\n\nViewing Malta Comino's Blue Lagoon is one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations (Credit: Viewing Malta)\n\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\n\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\n\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds, protesting what they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\n\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\n\nAlamy Locals hope that the new daily visitor cap will help with the island's overtourism issues (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\n\nThey go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed… Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference – Joanne Gatt\n\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations to combat overtourism. Venice has introduced entry fees for day-trippers, while Athens has capped daily visitor numbers to the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\n\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\n\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Om Ali: An 'unforgettable' sweet with a sinister history\n\n4 days ago Share Save Soumya Gayatri Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs millions of people break their Ramadan fast, many believers around the world reach for a wildly popular dish tied to an unbelievable legend.\n\nOn a hot and sultry August evening in 2011, I sat at a table in my favourite restaurant in Kuwait City, facing the calm waters of the Persian Gulf, waiting for my iftar platter to arrive. The elaborate meal – consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf, shish tawook (a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts – was delicious.\n\nYet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.\n\nFlash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.\n\nSoumya Gayatri The author seeks out Om Ali in every Middle Eastern city she visits (Credit: Soumya Gayatri)\n\n\"A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,\" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog, Chez Nermine. \"It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition – the star of Egyptian cuisine,\" she adds.\n\nOm Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.\n\nWhere to find Om Ali Although Om Ali is available at all major cafes and bakeries in Egypt throughout the year, the variety and volume are staggering during Ramadan. Some of the best places to sample authentic Om Ali in Cairo are El Malky, Simonds Bakery & Café and Nola Bakery.\n\nOm Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumption skyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted a video of Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.\n\n\"I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,\" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and my local tour guide in Cairo. \"Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?\" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is especially popular during Ramadan, and is one of Egypt's most beloved sweets (Credit: Alamy)\n\nWith my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding at El Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.\n\nOm Ali, which means \"Mother of Ali\" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusual name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.\n\nOm Ali was the first wife of the first sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Shajar Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-Durr had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.\n\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beating Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killing Al-Durr, Om Ali instructed her cook to bake something special to commemorate her success and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.\n\nAlamy Om Ali is rumoured to hark back to the Mamluk dynasty – and a bizarre murder (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.\n\n\"There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,\" says Dr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. \"Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murder… I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nFurther, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titled Kitāb nasị̄hạt al-anām fī hụsn al-tạʻām, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.\n\nYet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. \"Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread called roqaq since ancient times,\" she says. According to the book The Pharaoh's Kitchen by Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. \"So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.\"\n\nAlamy Om Ali is also known as Egyptian bread pudding or Egyptian bread roqaq (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDespite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil – in this case, the unjust queen.\n\n\"We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,\" says Omran. \"Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,\" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama series Abbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts the legend of Om Ali to his onscreen family.\n\nThe popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providing instant nourishment to a fasting body that has run out of glucose. \"In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,\" Mansour points out. \"That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,\" she adds. (A calorie analysis reveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts like kunefe and baklava.)\n\nBesides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. \"It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,\" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.\n\nAlamy The dish provides simple, sugary nourishment to those during Ramadan (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOm Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. \"The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad – a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,\" says Omran.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

A new exhibition explores this close friendship, and how it benefited art history.\n\nOn 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin.\n\nA rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. \"Roulin… has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,\" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Van Gogh's Postman Joseph Roulin, 1888 – Roulin was a close friend and loyal ally of the artist (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nPaying homage to this touching relationship is the exhibition Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits, opening at the MFA Boston, USA, on 30 March, before moving on to its co-organiser, the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in October. This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.\n\nRoulin wasn't just a model for Van Gogh – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship – Katie Hanson\n\n\"So much of what I was hoping for with this exhibition is a human story,\" co-curator Katie Hanson (MFA Boston) tells the BBC. \"The exhibition really highlights that Roulin isn't just a model for him – this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship.\" Van Gogh's tumultuous relationship with Gauguin, and the fallout between them that most likely precipitated the ear incident, has tended to overshadow his narrative, but Roulin offered something more constant and uncomplicated. We see this in the portraits – the open honesty with which he returns Van Gogh's stare, and the mutual respect and affection that radiate from the canvas.\n\nA new life in Arles\n\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in February 1888, believing the brighter light and intense colours would better his art, and that southerners were \"more artistic\" in appearance, and ideal subjects to paint. Hanson emphasises Van Gogh's \"openness to possibility\" at this time, and his feeling, still relatable today, of being a new face in town. \"We don't have to hit on our life's work on our first try; we might also be seeking and searching for our next direction, our next place,\" she says. And it's in this spirit that Van Gogh, a newcomer with \"a big heart\", welcomed new connections.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A pen, ink and chalk portrait of Roulin, 1888, is among the exhibits in the show Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nBefore moving into the yellow house next door, now known so well inside and out, Van Gogh rented a room above the Café de la Gare. The bar was frequented by Joseph Roulin, who lived on the same street and worked at the nearby railway station supervising the loading and unloading of post. Feeling that his strength lay in portrait painting, but struggling to find people to pose for him, Van Gogh was delighted when the characterful postman, who drank a sizeable portion of his earnings at the café, agreed to pose for him, asking only to be paid in food and drink.\n\nBetween August 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh made six portraits of Roulin, symbols of companionship and hope that contrast with the motifs of loneliness, despair and impending doom seen in some of his other works. In each, Roulin is dressed in his blue postal worker's uniform, embellished with gold buttons and braid, the word \"postes\" proudly displayed on his cap. Roulin's stubby nose and ruddy complexion, flushed with years of drinking, made him a fascinating muse for the painter, who described him as \"a more interesting man than many people\".\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Portrait of Joseph Roulin, 1889 – Van Gogh's paintings of the Roulin family were full of warmth and optimism (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin was just 12 years older than Van Gogh, but he became a guiding light and father figure to the lonely painter – on account of Roulin's generous beard and apparent wisdom, Van Gogh nicknamed him Socrates. Born into a wealthy family, Van Gogh belonged to a very different social class from Roulin, but was taken with his \"strong peasant nature\" and forbearance when times were hard. Roulin was a proud and garrulous republican, and when Van Gogh saw him singing La Marseillaise, he noticed how painterly he was, \"like something out of Delacroix, out of Daumier\". He saw in him the spirit of the working man, describing his voice as possessing \"a distant echo of the clarion of revolutionary France\".\n\nThe friendship soon opened the door to four further sitters: Roulin's wife, Augustine, and their three children. We meet their 17-year-old son Armand, an apprentice blacksmith wearing the traces of his first facial hair, and appearing uneasy with the painter's attention; his younger brother, 11-year-old schoolboy Camille, described in the exhibition catalogue as \"squirming in his chair\"; and Marcelle, the couple's chubby-cheeked baby, who, Roulin writes, \"makes the whole house happy\". Each painting represents a different stage of life, and each sitter was gifted their portrait. In total, Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the Roulins, a significant output for one family, rarely seen in art history.\n\nCourtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Roulin's wife is portrayed in Lullaby: Madame Augustine Rocking a Cradle (La Berceuse) 1889 (Credit: Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nVan Gogh had once hoped to be a father and husband himself, and his relationship with the Roulin family let him experience some of that joy. In a letter to Theo, he described Roulin playing with baby Marcelle: \"It was touching to see him with his children on the last day, above all with the very little one when he made her laugh and bounce on his knees and sang for her.\" Outside these walls, Van Gogh often experienced hostility from the locals, who described him as \"the redheaded madman\", and even petitioned for his confinement. By contrast, the Roulins accepted his mental illness, and their home offered a place of safety and understanding.\n\nThe relationship, however, was far from one-sided. This educated visitor with his unusual Dutch accent was unlike anyone Roulin had ever met, and offered \"a different kind of interaction\", explains Hanson. \"He's new in town, new to Roulin's stories and he's going to have new stories to tell.\" Roulin enjoys offering advice – on furnishing the yellow house for example – and when, in the summer of 1888, Madame Roulin returned to her home town to deliver Marcelle, Roulin, left alone, found Van Gogh welcome company.\n\nVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston The Baby Marcelle Roulin and Armand Roulin, both 1888 – Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the family (Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nRoulin also got the rare opportunity to have portraits painted for free, and when, the following year, he was away for work in Marseille, it comforted him that baby Marcelle could still see his portrait hanging above her cradle. His fondness for Van Gogh shines through their correspondence. \"Continue to take good care of yourself, follow the advice of your good Doctor and you will see your complete recovery to the satisfaction of your relatives and your friends,\" he wrote to him from Marseille, signing off: \"Marcelle sends you a big kiss.\"\n\nVan Gogh lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies\n\nVan Gogh's portraits placed him in the heart of the family home. In his five versions of La Berceuse, meaning both \"lullaby\" and \"the woman who rocks the cradle\", Mme Roulin held a string device, fashioned by Van Gogh, that rocked the baby's cradle beyond the canvas, permitting the pair the peace to complete the artwork. The joyful background colours – green, blue, yellow or red – vary from one family member to another. Exuberant floral backdrops, reserved for the parents, come later, conveying happiness and affection – a blooming that took place since the earlier, plainer portraits.\n\nArt history has also greatly benefitted from the freedom this relationship granted Van Gogh to experiment with portraiture, and to develop his own style with its delineated shapes, bold, glowing colours, and thick wavy strokes that make the forms vibrate with life. In the security of this friendship, he overturned the conventions of portrait painting, prioritising an emotional response to his subject, resolving \"not to render what I have before my eyes\" but to \"express myself forcefully\", and to paint Roulin, he told Theo, \"as I feel him\".\n\nCredit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston A photograph of Joseph Roulin in 1902, two years after the death of his friend Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Courtesy Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)\n\nHad Van Gogh not felt Roulin's unwavering support, he may not have survived the series of devastating breakdowns that began in December 1888 when he took a razor to his ear. With the care of those close to him, he lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies.\n\nLike the intimate portraits he created in Arles, the exhibition courses with optimism. \"I hope being with these works of art and exploring his creative process – and his ways of creating connection – will be a heartwarming story,\" Hanson says. Far from \"shying away from the sadness\" of this period of Van Gogh's life, she says, the exhibition bears witness to the power of supportive relationships and \"the reality that sadness and hope can coexist\".\n\nVan Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits is at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 30 March to 7 September 2025, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam from 3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The European towns that give away free chickens\n\n5 hours ago Share Save Lucy Sherriff Share Save\n\nGetty Images (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nTowns in France and Belgium have been giving out free chickens for years to combat food waste – could the idea catch on elsewhere?\n\nAround Easter in 2015, the small French village of Colmar started handing out free chickens to its residents. The aim of this experimental new scheme, launched by the waste collection department in the small village in north eastern France, was to reduce food waste.\n\nThe project had been in the works for some time. The then-president of Colmar Agglomération (a role similar to a mayor), Gilbert Meyer, had been reelected in 2014 with the slogan \"one family, one hen\", which aimed to encourage residents to adopt a chicken. The following year the operation was launched, in partnership with two nearby chicken farms. Residents were encouraged to think of the free eggs – the effort put into raising a chicken would pay off quickly.\n\nMore than 200 homes in four municipalities signed up and were given two chickens each – either red chickens (Poulet Rouge) or Alsace chickens, an old and local breed.\n\nEach household signed a pledge committing to raising the chickens, with the understanding that the waste department could conduct welfare spot checks on the animals at any time. Henhouses were not provided; it was up to the residents to build or buy their own. The department ensured that each home had enough space for the hens – between 8 and 10 sq m (86 and 108 sq ft).\n\nThe scheme was a success – and is still underway. \"Over the years, other municipalities have joined and since 2022 all 20 municipalities of the agglomération have participated,\" says Eric Straumann, current president of the Colmar Agglomération.\n\nTo date, 5,282 hens have been distributed to local residents, and applications are currently open for the next round of distribution in June 2025. Not only have the residents received a plentiful supply of free eggs, but food waste has also been averted from landfill as chickens are fed kitchen scraps which would otherwise be thrown away.\n\n\"Considering that a hen has a life expectancy of four years on average and that she consumes 150g (5.3oz) of bio-waste per day, we estimate that we have avoided 273.35 tonnes of bio-waste [since 2015],\" says Straumann.\n\nGetty Images The small French village of Colmar has been handing out free chickens to its residents since 2015 (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nFood waste contributes more methane emissions to the atmosphere than any other landfilled materials, due to its quick decay rate. In the US, around 58% of methane emissions released into the atmosphere from waste landfills are from food waste. Although shorter-lived in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane has a global warming impact more than 80 times higher than CO2 over a 20-year period.\n\nAround one third of food produced for humans is lost or wasted globally, amounting to 1.3 billion tonnes per year. Food loss and waste account for 8-10% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions – which is nearly five times the total emissions from the aviation sector.\n\nEven though chicken owners in the UK have been advised to avoid to feeding the birds kitchen scraps due to concerns about spreading disease, it's perfectly legal to do so elsewhere in the world, and it can have a meaningful impact on reducing food waste – and kickstart a cycle that benefits everyone.\n\n\"Proposed with the aim of reducing food waste, chickens make it possible to promote traditional circular economy practices that are still relevant today, particularly in villages, and which are now developing even in urban areas: chickens fed on our food waste in return provide us with fresh eggs,\" says Straumann.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the chickens can teach children in Colmar about animals and the importance of protecting the natural world, he adds.\n\nCarbon Count The emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view. Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\n\nColmar is not the only town to hand out free birds – nor was it the first to do so. In 2012 in another a small north-western French town called Pincé, ­two chickens were offered to each household to help them cut down on organic waste. \"To begin with it was a joke, but then we realised it was a very good idea,\" Lydie Pasteau, the mayor of Pincé, told local media at the time. A total of 31 families were given chickens, along with a bag of feed, with Pasteau calling the scheme a \"surprising\" success.\n\nIn Belgium, chickens have been handed out in the cities of Mouscron and Antwerp and the province of Limburg, although residents had to sign an agreement not to eat the chickens for at least two years. More than 2,500 families adopted hens in one year alone in Limburg, according to some reports, while in Mouscron, 50 pairs of chickens were given out in the second round of the scheme, after the initial giveaway was a success. Residents, who had to prove they had sufficient space in their gardens to keep the birds, were given basic instructions on chicken keeping.\n\nAlamy Colmar residents have been left with a plentiful supply of eggs since 2015 (Credit: Alamy)\n\nIn theory, the scheme seems like a good idea, especially in parts of the world where eggs are either in shortage or very expensive. In California or New York, for example, a dozen eggs cost around $9 (£7). As some chicken breeds can lay up to 300 eggs every year, one chicken could lay up to $225 (£178) worth of eggs each year.\n\nIn practice though, Paul Behrens, a professor at the University of Oxford focusing on food systems, says there are some hurdles in the way: \"I'm sure it could be done in the UK but I'm not sure it's a good idea,\" he says. \"Bird flu is an ever-present worry. Current regulations mean you have to keep birds in fenced areas or indoors – this may again be a problem for animal welfare, or even disease spread if people don't do this.\"\n\nThe idea wouldn't work well in the US either, says Mark Bomford, director of Yale University's sustainable food programme. \"I love chickens, but I don't love the sound of this, especially in the US,\" Bomford says.\n\nThe US is currently experiencing an egg shortage due to an outbreak of bird flu – and as a result egg prices have skyrocketed 36% compared to 2023 – but handing out free chickens would not be an \"appropriate\" response, Bomford says.\n\n\"Economically, steep inflation for a basic grocery item like eggs hurts the poor far more than it hurts the rich. To care for chickens you need feed, water, housing, space and free time,\" he says. \"Most people with lower incomes don't have access to these things. By the time you have factored in all these costs, chickens are rarely 'free' and few people realise any net cost savings on eggs.\"\n\nRising egg prices in the US spark chicken rental trend in New Hampshire\n\nOne couple, however, did come up with a unique solution – renting chickens. Christine and Brian Templeton of Rent The Chicken in New Hampshire provide hens, feed and support for six months, allowing customers to collect fresh eggs at home. Business, the couple reports, is booming.\n\nIt's important to temper egg expectations though, warns Behrens – industrial birds lay far more eggs than a home-kept healthy bird would. \"Common and modern egg-laying birds are often in huge pain their entire lives, partly due to their genetics which are centred on providing as much 'output' as possible,\" he says. \"If you use older breeds and allow them to live a long, healthy life then you can avoid many of the most egregious animal welfare issues.\"\n\n\"But people should then understand the tradeoff and expectations around that, you are having a much healthier bird in return for fewer eggs,\" he says.\n\nAnd from a food waste perspective, the ideal thing is to simply not waste the food in the first place – some researchers believe that composting can actually increase food waste.\n\n\"They think 'oh, it's okay as we compost',\" says Behrens. \"Which is better than nothing but much worse than not wasting things in the first place. It could be even worse with chickens because you are getting eggs from them. People might waste even more than if they composted.\"\n\nBut one unexpected benefit that was observed in Colmar – that had nothing to do with eggs or food waste – was the community the chickens created. Residents would bond over raising the chickens and would work with neighbours to care for the chickens when they went on holiday. \"Residents have welcomed this operation since its launch,\" says Straumann. \"And that's why all the municipalities in Colmar still participate in our programme today.\"\n\n--\n\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.",

But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevičiusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things – it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevičius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\n\nWhile Eidukevičius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity – particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce – in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\n\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė The fermentation process produces a slightly carbonated drink that's full of \"good\" bacteria (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria – meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\n\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick – consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva Šidlaitė, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\n\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus – like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\n\nIeva Šidlaitė Kvass is often made with fruit or vegetables, with beetroot being a popular option (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\n\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\n\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogailė Čojūtė, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\n\nIeva Šidlaitė In Lithuania, traditionalists see gira as a tonic for the common cold (Credit: Ieva Šidlaitė)\n\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\n\nWhere to try Gira In Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmyninė, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\n\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation’s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\n\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says Čojūtė.\n\nInstead, Eidukevičius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevičius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\n\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevičius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "The grannies who saved Albanian cuisine\n\n7 March 2025 Share Save Tristan Rutherford Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAfter being sealed off from the outside world for decades and experiencing a mass exodus, Albania is leaning into its culinary roots with the help of grandma chefs.\n\nTefta Pajenga, aged 76, is one of many pension-age TV chefs in Albania. In her nationally televised cooking show, the retired teacher instructs a younger housewife how to cook japrakë, a traditional platter of vine leaves stuffed with rice and herbs.\n\nJaprakë holds a special place in Albanian hearts. It's typically prepared by families together and then shared on Christian and Muslim feast days in this religiously diverse nation. Like so many dishes in this culinary crossroads, the recipe comes from elsewhere (the name derives from the Turkish word for \"leaf\", courtesy of Albania's more-than 500 years under Ottoman rule). Yet, the ingredients are all local: dill, peppers and mint from northern Albania.\n\nToday, Albanian grannies like Pajenga are teaching multiple generations in one of Europe's youngest-aged countries how to cook age-old dishes. That's because the Balkan nation has suffered not one, but two bouts of culinary amnesia over the past 80 years.\n\nAlamy Japrakë is a popular Albanian dish among both Christians and Muslims (Credit: Alamy)\n\nFirst, from 1946 to 1991, Albania was ruled by hardline communists who effectively sealed the small, mountainous nation off from the outside world, leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say it was once \"the North Korea of Europe\". During this period, cookbooks were burnt, imports were prohibited, foreign travel was banned, food was collectivised and shortages were widespread. It was a recipe for disaster.\n\nSecond, in the violent build-up and aftermath of communism's collapse in the 1990s, 710,000 citizens – 20% of the population – fled Albania from 1989 to 2001 in search of work in other countries. Over time, Pajenga said that many of these emigrants forgot their grandmothers' recipes as they adapted to new countries and cultures. Between the widespread food shortages during communism and the subsequent emigration after it, by the early 21st Century, many Albanians at home and abroad had forgotten how to prepare traditional Albanian cuisine – except for women of a certain age.\n\nIronically, Pajenga says that the Albania's transition to democracy compounded the problem. \"During communism, people had one fixed job from 07:00 until 15:00,\" she recalls. \"When democracy came, you needed more than one job to feed the family.\" Therefore, many of those who did recall how to prepare traditional Albanian dishes now no longer had the time to make them.\n\nAlamy Albania was once known as \"the North Korea of Europe\" (Credit: Alamy)\n\nSo, when Pajenga started her TV show in 2004, \"my audience was not for chefs but for housewives\" and also young people, \"who were lacking the knowledge or had forgotten how to make traditional cuisine\".\n\nAlbania's culinary culture has long reflected its status as a stepping stone between East and West. The Romans introduced grapes, olives and other modern Albanian staples when they took hold of the area in the 2nd Century BCE. Starting in the 16th Century, dishes like Arnavut ciğeri (Albanian liver) spread east from Albania across the Ottoman Empire, while sutlijaš (rice pudding) likely arrived in Albania courtesy of the Ottomans. And after World War Two, imported dishes like ajvar (a relish made from roasted red peppers, aubergine and spices) migrated south from the northern Balkans.\n\nSome indigenous foods, like mishavinë (a type of white, grainy cheese), cannot be found anywhere else. Its preparation method, in which curd is packed tightly for three months inside animal fat until it ferments into a piquant cheese, has been passed down by generations of transhumant herders in the Albanian Alps. Other age-old Albanian dishes include flia, a pancake with crepe-like layers brushed with cream, and byrek me mish, a Turkish-style borek laced with paprika.\n\nGjyste Bici, 67, learned centuries-old recipes at her grandmother's knee in Albania's northern Alps, where snowy winters can still cut off residents for months at a time. \"Even before communism there was little material published, so recipes were always passed from grandmothers to younger generations,\" she says.\n\nAlamy Flia is a typical and very popular Albanian dish (Credit: Alamy)\n\nMany Albanian recipes have a religious root. This was frowned upon under communism, especially after 1967, when authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha banned all religious practices.\n\n\"The dictatorship tried to destroy all religions,\" recalls Dallendyshe Xhahysa, a 91-year-old amateur chef who memorised Albanian recipes from her ancestors and made them through the country's near-half century of communist rule. According to Xhahysa, \"recipes used in Muslim and Christian celebrations never would have survived if it wasn't for the efforts of grandmothers like me\".\n\n\"We had to cook special dishes secretly during Easter or Ramadan,\" continues Xhahysa. One such dish was halva, a dense, fudge-like dessert traditionally shared on the holiest day of Ramadan, Lailat al Qadr.\n\n\"If you cooked halva over Ramadan, neighbours would spy on you in order to get a bonus from the state,\" Xhahysa remembers. So as not to attract attention, the ingredients were purchased weeks in advance. \"We would cook halva with the windows closed or curtains drawn\" to curtail the fragrant waft of sugar, nuts and rosewater.\n\nAlamy Albanians had to make certain religious dishes, like halva, in secret during communism (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe punishment if caught preparing a religious feast was harsh. \"We could be taken to a re-education camp for many months to be given a bad job, like cleaning a jail in a remote area,\" recalls Xhahysa, shuddering.\n\nExtreme food shortages led to the loss of other recipes. \"Very few people were allowed to keep animals or farm land,\" explains Bici. Only those in rural areas were allowed to work a 50-sq-m plot and keep a few chickens. \"It was forbidden to own a pig or sheep.\"\n\nEverything was rationed, continues Bici. \"Each month you were allowed 10kg of potatoes and 2kg of cheese per family.\"\n\nWithout easy access to ingredients or cookbooks, centuries-old recipes like tavë krapi (a baked carp casserole) were largely forgotten due to the prohibition of private fishing.\n\nUka Farm Following the fall of communism, many farmers migrated to Albanian cities, leaving only the elderly behind (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\nWhen Albania's borders finally opened up in the 1990s and its national television networks were no longer controlled by the state, many grannies started using TV to revive the nation's long-lost culinary heritage.\n\nBici began cooking on the show The Albanian Sunday in 2007, showcasing recipes she says were cooked \"for thousands of years\", like lakror me arra (an Albanian pie often made with layered ricotta, nettles, leeks, lamb and nuts).\n\nBut while Bici and Pajenga's cooking shows were helping to revive traditional recipes, they were fighting against another tide: farmers in rural Albania were migrating to Tirana in search of work and many rural villages became ghost towns. \"Farming has still not fully recovered from what happened [in the decades after communism],\" says Pajenga.\n\nBici has made it her mission to ensure Albania's traditional recipes aren't forgotten a third time. The grandmother has collated age-old cooking methods in a book, Unique Cuisine of the Albanian Highlands. She also cooks mountain recipes on the TV show Histori Shqiptare (Albanian History).\n\nUka Farm Uka Farm uses recipes from grandmothers like Xhahysa (Credit: Uka Farm)\n\n\"I have many requests from Instagram for old recipes,\" Bici says. \"If youngsters follow my recipe for lakror on TikTok, that's fine too.\"\n\nXhahysa, now a great-grandmother, is also still sharing her knowledge. She started cooking with her grandmother in the 1930s and contributed recipes to Albania's first farm-to-fork restaurant, Uka Farm, a Tirana-based wine bar and agrotourism that has inspired 100 rural farm stays across Albania.\n\nXhahysa's recipe of fërgesë (a baked vegetable dish with cheese) is a popular appetiser at Uka Farm. The farm's butter-fried peppers served with a big dollop of gjizë (a ricotta-style cheese) is a taste of Albania’s forgotten past.\n\nInspired by Pajenga, Bici and other TV-cooking grannies, a 2018 event in Tirana pairing 12 grandmothers with 12 top chefs became an instant Albanian sensation, spawning several granny-meets-millennial TV shows like Gjyshet Milionere (\"Millionaire Grandmothers\").\n\nMullixhiu Chef Bledar Kola has been turning to Albanian grandmothers to revive the nation's traditional cuisine (Credit: Mullixhiu)\n\nThe event was hosted by one of Albania's most famous chefs, Bledar Kola, who has dedicated much of his career to championing traditional Albanian cuisine. \"Not being too cocky,\" says Kola, \"but this show started a small spark on a big fire.\"\n\nAfter a career working in Europe's top restaurants, including stages at Le Gavroche in London and noma in Copenhagen, Kola returned to Tirana a decade ago to present ancient Albanian recipes in a more modern way at the capital's top restaurant Mullixhiu. In the absence of cookbooks, he also picked up skills from an Albanian granny.\n\nNow Kola is going one step further by opening a traditional restaurant in Gjirokaster, a Unesco-inscribed city in southern Albania. At the forthcoming rural restaurant Mullixhino (which is expected to open in late 2025), the focus is squarely on Albania's age-old dishes. \"The cuisine will be garden-inspired, everything cooked on an open fire, in an open kitchen,\" says Kola.\n\nThe restaurant's recipes are an homage to Albanian grandmothers. \"We've been meeting grandmothers for coffee to come up with a great concept,\" says Kola. \"We will serve traditional food from Albania's south, influenced by grandmothers in the region.\"\n\nAlamy Thanks to Albanian grandmothers, the nation's once-forgotten foods are returning (Credit: Alamy)\n\nA new foodie almanac containing 7,000 Albanian ingredients, dishes and cooking methods – many sourced from grandmothers – is also in progress and is being co-written by Kola's brother Nikolin, alongside nine academics.\n\nNikolin believes the book \"will raise awareness of Albanian food, like what René [Redzepi] did for Danish cooking\".\n\nThanks to grannies, Albanian cuisine is finally being reborn.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Rembrandt to Picasso: Five ways to spot a fake masterpiece\n\n6 days ago Share Save Kelly Grovier Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe recent discovery of an art forger's workshop reminds us of the long history of fraudulent artworks – here are the simple rules to work them out.\n\nIt's everywhere: fake news, deep fakes, identity fraud. So ensnared are we in a culture of digitised deceptions, a phenomenon increasingly augmented by artificial intelligence, it would be easy to think that deceit itself is a high-tech invention of the cyber age. Recent revelations however – from the discovery of an elaborate, if decidedly low-tech, art forger's workshop in Rome to the sensational allegation that a cherished Baroque masterpiece in London's National Gallery is a crude simulacrum of a lost original – remind us that duplicity in the world of art has a long and storied history, one written not in binary ones and zeroes, but in impossible pigments, clumsy brushstrokes and suspicious signatures. When it comes to falsification and phoniness, there is indeed no new thing under the Sun.\n\nOn 19 February, Italy's Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage uncovered a covert forgery operation in a northern district of Rome. Authorities confiscated more than 70 fraudulent artworks falsely attributed to notable artists from Pissarro to Picasso, Rembrandt to Dora Maar, along with materials used to mimic vintage canvases, artist signatures, and the stamps of galleries no longer in operation. The suspect, who has yet to be apprehended, is thought to have used online platforms such as Catawiki and eBay to hawk their phoney wares, deceiving potential buyers with convincing certificates of authenticity that they likewise contrived.\n\nNews of the clandestine lab's discovery was quickly followed by publicity for a new book, due for release this week, alleging that one of The National Gallery's highlights is not at all what it seems. According to artist and historian Euphrosyne Doxiadis, author of NG6461: The Fake National Gallery Rubens, the painting Samson and Delilah – a large oil-on-wood attributed to the 17th Century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens and purchased by the London museum in 1980 for £2.5m (then the second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction) – is three centuries younger than the date of 1609-10 that sits beside it on the gallery wall and is incalculably less accomplished than the museum believes.\n\nAlamy Samson and Delilah, by Peter Paul Rubens (Credit: Alamy)\n\nDoxiadis's conclusion corroborates one reached in 2021 by the Swiss company, Art Recognition, which determined, through the use of AI, that there was a 91% probability that Samson and Delilah is the work of someone other than Rubens. Her assertion that the brushwork we see in the painting is crass and wholly inconsistent with the fluid flow of the Flemish master's hand is strongly contested by The National Gallery, which stands by its attribution. \"Samson and Delilah has long been accepted by leading Rubens scholars as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens\", it said in a statement given to the BBC. \"Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality. A technical examination of the picture was presented in an article in The National Gallery's Technical Bulletin in 1983. The findings remain valid.\"\n\nThe divergence of opinion between the museum's experts and those who doubt the work's authenticity opens a curious space in which to reflect on intriguing questions of artistic value and merit. Is there ever legitimacy in forgery? Can fakes be masterpieces? As more sophisticated tools of analysis are applied to paintings and drawings whose legitimacy has long been in question (including several works attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, such as the hotly disputed chalk and ink drawing La Bella Principessa), as well as those whose validity has never been in doubt, debates about the integrity of cultural icons are only likely to accelerate. What follows are a handful of handy principles to keep in mind when navigating the impending controversies – five simple rules for spotting a fake masterpiece.\n\nRule 1: Pigments never lie\n\nAlamy Portrait of Saint Jerome (Credit: Alamy)\n\nTo be a successful art forger requires more than technical proficiency and a misplaced ethical compass. It isn't enough to approximate the dibby-dabby dots of a Georges Seurat, say, or the thick expressive swirls of Vincent van Gogh. You need to know your history as well as your chemistry. Anachronistic pigments will give you away every time and were the downfall of German art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi and his wife Helene, who succeeded in selling makeshift modernist masterpieces for millions before a careless squeeze of prefab paint onto their audacious palettes in 2006 sealed their fate.\n\nBeltracchi, whose modus operandi was to create \"new\" works by everyone from Max Ernst to André Derain, rather than recreate lost ones, was always careful to mix his own paints to ensure they contained only ingredients available to whomever he was attempting to impersonate. He only slipped up once. And that was enough. Fabricating a wonky Der Blaue Reiter-ish red landscape of jigsawed horses that he attributed to the German Expressionist Heinrich Campendonk, Beltracchi reached for a readymade tube of paint, which he hadn't realised contained a pinch of titanium white – a relatively new pigment to which Campendonk would not have had access. It was all investigators would need to prove the work, which had sold for €2.8m, was a fake.\n\nBeltracchi was unlucky. The gap between titanium white's availability and its potential use by Campendonk was only a few years. On occasion, the divide is shockingly wide. Analysis of a Portrait of Saint Jerome, once attributed to the Italian master Parmigianino and sold by Sotheby's auction house in 2012 for $842,500, exposed the prevalence throughout the work of phthalocyanine green, a synthetic pigment invented in 1935, four centuries after the 16th-Century Renaissance artist worked. Artists may be visionaries, but they're not time travellers.\n\nRule 2: Keep the past present\n\nMuseum Boijmans Van Beuningan The Men at Emmaus, by Han van Meegeren (Credit: Museum Boijmans Van Beuningan)\n\nIt is uplifting to believe that one's value, as a person, is not tethered to the past. Not so with art. A painting, sculpture, or drawing without a heavy history is not, alas, more inspiring for its lack of baggage. It is suspicious. Or rather, it should be. All too often, greed can interfere in the clear-sightedness of assessing the authenticity of a painting or sculpture. Things have histories we want them to have. That was certainly the case with a succession of phoney Vermeers that issued from the workshop of a Dutch portraitist, Han van Meegeren – one of the most prolific and successful forgers of the 20th Century. Desperate to believe that the miraculous appearance of canvases, including a depiction of Christ and The Men at Emmaus, might be lost masterpieces from the same hand that made Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Milkmaid, collectors were blind to the glaring absence of any trace of the paintings' provenance – their prior ownership, exhibition history, and proof of sales. Everyone was fooled.\n\nIn authenticating the painting in the Burlington Magazine, one expert insisted \"in no other picture by the great Master of Delft do we find such sentiment, such a profound understanding of the Bible story – a sentiment so nobly human expressed through the medium of the highest art\". But it was all a lie. In a remarkable twist, Van Meegeren eventually chose to expose himself as a fraudster shortly after the end of World War Two, after being charged by Dutch authorities with the crime of selling a Vermeer – therefore a national treasure – to the Nazi official Hermann Göring. To prove his innocence, if innocence it might be called, and demonstrate that he had merely sold a worthless fake of his own forging, not a real Old Master, Van Meegeren performed the extraordinary feat of whisking up a fresh masterpiece from thin air before the experts' astonished eyes. Voilà, Vermeer.\n\nThe Hay Wain, by John Constable (Credit: BBC)\n\nMore recently, in a 2017 episode of BBC's popular arts programme Fake or Fortune?, presenter Philip Mould's long-held hunch that a painting he once sold for £35,000 was really a priceless original by the English Romantic artist John Constable – an alternative, and previously undocumented, view of the landscape artist's 1821 masterpiece The Hay Wain – was dramatically confirmed after Mould and fellow presenter Fiona Bruce excavated long-buried financial records. Having traced the painting's ownership back to a sale by the artist's son, the team recalculated the canvass true value to be £2m, proving that some pasts are worth hanging onto.\n\nRule 3: Squint\n\nArtists' gestures – their simultaneously studied and instinctive brushwork and draughtsmanship – are nothing less than fingerprints writ large across canvases and works on paper. One artist's lightness of touch and another's sturdiness of stroke are exceedingly tricky to falsify, especially if you are conscious that every twitch of your brush and jot of your pen will be scrutinised by suspicious eyes and cutting-edge equipment. Pressure under pressure is hard to maintain, an obstacle that the British forger Eric Hebborn (who died under suspicious circumstances in Rome in 1996 after a career spent counterfeiting more than 1,000 works attributed to everyone from Mantegna to Tiepolo, Poussin to Piranesi) overcame with alcohol.\n\nBy all accounts, brandy was Hebborn's tipple of choice for calming his rattling nerves. It allowed him to inhabit, without inhibition, the mind and muscle of whichever old master he was channelling. Whereas fakes from the hands of Beltracchi and Van Meegeren have since been found under closer inspection to be riddled with incoherent gestures, the fluidity of drawings falsified by the tipsy Hebborn in his heyday in the 1970s and 80s continues to confound the experts. To this day, institutions that possess works that passed through his hands refuse to accept they are all fakes, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's pen and ink drawing View of the Temples of Venus and of Diana in Baia from the South, a work it still insists is from the circle of Jan Brueghel the Elder. What do you think?\n\nRule 4: Go deeper\n\nGetty Images Still life with meadow flowers and roses, by Vincent van Gogh (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhen the analysis of pigments, provenance, and paintbrush pressure still leaves you stumped, it may be necessary to dive a little deeper. For 20 years since the 1990s, the authenticity of a still life purportedly by Vincent van Gogh was serially confirmed and refuted by experts. To some, the garish reds and submarine blues that echoed eerily from the bouquet of roses, daisies, and wildflowers didn't have the ring of truth and seemed at odds with the painter's palette. The absence of any ownership record for the painting didn't help.\n\nBut an X-ray undertaken in 2012 put questions to rest when it revealed that the artist, pinching pennies, reused a canvas on which he had created another image entirely – one to which he makes explicit reference in a letter from January 1886. \"This week\", Van Gogh remarked to his brother Theo, \"I painted a large thing with two nude torsos – two wrestlers… and I really like doing that.\" As if proleptically anticipating the ensuing scholarly wrangle over the work's authenticity that the painting would in time trigger, the static tussle of the two athletes, trapped beneath paint for over a century, not only rescued the work from unfair allegations of illegitimacy, it created a kind of fresh composite painting, a vivid compression – a freeze frame of a restless mind forever scuffling with itself, desperate to survive.\n\nRule 5: It's the little things that give you away\n\nAs a final safeguard in authenticating a work of art, run the spell check. Doing so would have saved the collector Pierre Lagrange $17m – the price he paid in 2007 for an otherwise compelling forgery of a small 12x18in (30x46cm) painting falsely attributed to the American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock. Famous for his drippy style, Pollock has a surprisingly legible signature, an unmistakable \"c\" before the final \"k\". The skipped consonant would do more than expose a single forgery; it would shatter the reputation of an entire gallery.\n\nThe sloppy signature was just one of many missed red flags in works falsely attributed to Rothko, De Kooning, Motherwell and others that the Knoedler & Co gallery, one of New York's oldest and most esteemed art institutions, succeeded in selling for $80m. The fraudulent works had been supplied by a dubious dealer who claimed they came from an enigmatic collector, \"Mr X\". Just before the scandal erupted in the press, the gallery closed its doors after 165 years, while the suspected perpetrator of the fakes, a self-taught Chinese septuagenarian by the name of Pei-Shen Qian, who had operated from a forger's workshop in Queens, vanished; he later turned up in China.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "content": "Kek lapis: The most beautiful cake for Ramadan\n\n5 March 2025 Share Save Charukesi Ramadurai Share Save\n\nKitchen Confidante Kek lapis is an integral part of Ramadan festivities (Credit: Kitchen Confidante)\n\nThe cake is a sublime art form, involving numerous colours and flavours commingling into an oh-so-soft and delicious cake that hides a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\n\nThe rich, buttery aroma of kek lapis (layer cake) greets me when I walk into Seri's (short for Sharifah Zainon) small baking studio at her home near Kuala Lumpur. The alluring aroma is not surprising, given that Malaysia is gearing up to celebrate Raya, which is short for Hari Raya (the Day of Celebration in Malay), and refers to the festive occasion marking the end of Ramadan. Kek lapis is an integral part of these festivities.\n\nSeri puts her academic training as an engineer to good use in her current career as a baker. Watching her hands spreading the batter evenly on the pan, I think that baking a kek lapis is a bit like conducting a scientific experiment. Preparing this multi-layered Malaysian cake with colourful and complex patterns not only requires knowledge and skill, but also oodles of patience, an eye for precision and a steady hand.\n\nA degree in the sciences seems to come in handy for kek lapis bakers, seeing the elaborate designs that Karen Chai, another engineer turned baker, creates at her baking studio in a quiet Kuala Lumpur suburb. When Chai returned to Malaysia after studying pastry arts at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, she decided to focus on kek lapis, using her mother's recipe as a starting point. \"Learning about the science of baking has been very useful in making kek lapis,\" she said.\n\nThis layer cake first came to Malaysia from neighbouring Indonesia through the state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo. In the mid-19th Century, Dutch colonisers introduced the plain European spit cake – made with layers of dough deposited one by one onto a cylindrical rotating spit – to the nation then known as Batavia (now Jakarta). Indonesians added local spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg and turned it into the lapis legit, often known as the thousand-layer cake.\n\nKitchen Confidante This multi-layered cake not only requires knowledge and skill, but oodles of patience (Credit: Kitchen Confidante)\n\nUpon its arrival in neighbouring Malaysia in the 1970s, Sarawakians elevated the cake to a sublime art form, involving multiple layers and numerous colours and flavours commingling into the oh-so-soft and delicious kek lapis. While the classic kek lapis often looks like a plain loaf on the outside, cutting it reveals a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\n\nAlso called the Sarawak layer cake, kek lapis typically has a minimum of 12 layers. The cake is created by carefully adding one thin layer of batter after another onto a baking pan every few minutes, broiling (or grilling) each layer in the oven to ensure the lower layers are never burnt. The plain version alternates light and dark strips of cake batter, whereas the coloured cakes have geometric patterns that, depending on the final pattern, can involve 20 or more layers.\n\nThe final cake is cooled and then cut into strips, with different pieces reassembled using thick jam or condensed milk as adhesive. Often, multiple cakes have to be baked, and pieces from each of them are assembled to create a complex pattern. This is then wrapped up in a thin cake layer of a single colour, or arranged between two sets of plain (ie, with no colours or patterns) multi-layered cakes.\n\nIf all this sounds confusing, then imagine what it is like for the baker. Even the most experienced of them first draws these patterns on paper, clearly marking out sizes and colours, after which they get to work with the batter. A complex design can take up to eight hours to complete, with several chances for error at every step in the assembly process.\n\nCharukesi Ramadurai Seri puts her training as an engineer to good use in her current career as a baker (Credit: Charukesi Ramadurai)\n\nChai explains that as opposed to other complex layered cakes, it is particularly tough with kek lapis, since the error often becomes apparent only after the baker has finished assembling the pieces, \"so all the hard work goes down the drain\".\n\nShe then shows me photos of her mother's signature 16-piece design that was born out of an error in calculation. \"She baked a few extra layers by mistake and didn't want to throw those pieces away. She just cut that up and tried to form another block, and this design came out. So this is not something that you will find from other bakers,\" she said.\n\nBoth Seri and Chai say that the long and laborious baking process is worth the reward of seeing a perfectly executed design. \"But there are no short cuts,\" Chai warned. Indeed, seeing Seri at work, cutting and sticking these long strips together with a generous lashing of raspberry jam, brings to mind a complicated jigsaw puzzle slowly taking shape. \"It's like therapy, [but] it's also fun and creative\" she said.\n\nWhen I visited in mid-February, the bakers had been working non-stop for weeks, fulfilling Raya orders received through their social media channels. Back in their hometowns in Sarawak, kek lapis is part of every holiday celebration, including Chinese New Year, Raya, Christmas and the midyear harvest festival of Gawai Dayak, cutting across communal and religious boundaries.\n\nLapis by Seri The long and laborious baking process is worth the reward of a perfectly executed design (Credit: Lapis by Seri)\n\nSeri's long-term client and self-professed cake lover, Farazaila Wahet, said, \"This is an anytime cake for me, but of course for Raya, it is a must.\" The Sarawak native, who moved to Kuala Lumpur more than 10 years ago, said that the satisfaction she gets from kek lapis is unparalleled, because \"the texture is heavier and the taste is richer compared to any other cake.\"\n\nKek lapis is available in many flavours, such as chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, red velvet and pandan (a tropical plant with a strong aroma, commonly used in Southeast Asian cooking). Even popular malted drinks like Horlicks and Milo are used for flavouring. And now, artisanal bakers like Seri and Chai are trying to modernise this traditional cake to make it relevant to younger generations, while also staying true to the original recipe.\n\nSeri, for instance, makes exquisite chocolate batik art on the top layer to make her cakes even more attractive. \"Batik is traditional to Malaysia, so is kek lapis, and I love to combine the two to create this new version,\" she said.\n\nChai keeps experimenting not just with more complicated patterns, but also new ingredients and flavour pairings. In the past, she has created gluten-free kek lapis using coconut flour with peanut butter topping, and another unique version with fig, apricot and cinnamon.\n\nBaking a good kek lapis requires a lot of time and high-quality ingredients, which means that they are also expensive, with prices going up to RM300 (roughly £50) or more for a square, one-kilogram cake. But thankfully for the small-batch bakers, this traditional cake is constantly in demand from individual clients and it's also gaining in popularity as corporate gifts and wedding favours.\n\nThese bakers are on a mission to maintain this Sarawak culinary tradition, despite all the long hours and thin margins. As Seri said, \"Every time I make a kek lapis, it feels like a piece of home to me.\"\n\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\n---\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.",

        "content": "Visiting Antarctica or the Arctic? Here's how to minimise your impact\n\n3 hours ago Share Save Thea de Gallier Share Save\n\nAlamy (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs polar tourism surges, experts warn of its environmental impact. From transport choices to local food, here's how to visit responsibly while protecting fragile ecosystems.\n\nI first learned of Greenland's existence from a world map pinned on my childhood bedroom wall. Decades later, I finally made it to the capital, Nuuk. I'd long been fascinated by pictures of the brightly coloured wooden houses lining its rocky shores – red, yellow, green and blue against an icy backdrop. Small icebergs floated just offshore and the absence of trees gave a stark, otherworldly feel. I looked forward to experiencing the crisp, biting air, exploring Inuit art at the Nuuk Kunstmuseum and maybe, if I was lucky, spotting some seals or a passing whale.\n\nI'm not the only one entranced by Greenland's icy beauty: between 2018-2023, tourism to the country grew by 46%, with 131,767 visitors arriving in 2023. Much of this surge is due to the increasing number of cruise ships navigating Arctic waters.\n\nAccording to the Arctic Council, ships entering the Arctic Polar Code area – a regulated maritime zone around the North Pole – increased by 37% between 2013 and 2024. Many cruise operators, like Hurtigruten, Swan Hellenic and Ponant, offer routes encompassing Iceland, Svalbard and Greenland, with the latter expecting visitor numbers to keep growing thanks to a 2024 airport expansion in Nuuk and two more international airports set to be built by 2026.\n\nMeanwhile on the opposite side of the planet, Antarctica is seeing a similar tourism boom. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports a steady rise in visitors since the 1990s. In the 2022-23 season, 104,897 people visited the continent, rising to 124,262 last year. More than 80,000 of those set foot on Antarctic land – an alarming statistic for conservationists who warn that human presence can disrupt fragile ecosystems, alter animal behaviour and unwittingly bring invasive foreign organisms with them.\n\nAlamy The polar regions are threatened – and travellers can make careful choices to lessen their impact (Credit: Alamy)\n\nAs tourism to the poles increases, organisations like the Arctic Council, the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO) and Visit Greenland stress the urgent need to balance economic benefits with environmental responsibility. The lure of the polar regions is undeniable: the near lunar landscapes; the intensity of the blue sky on a freezing, sunny day; the thrill of fresh snow crunching underfoot; and the unique wildlife that calls these places home.\n\nJames Grecian, a marine ecologist at Durham University, UK, and scientist-in-residence at climate advocacy nonprofit Arctic Basecamp, has spent years studying polar wildlife. Last year, he was in Antarctica studying snow petrels – or more specifically, their vomit.\n\nThoughtful Travel Want to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\n\nSnow petrels' stomach oil deposits freeze into solid lumps that contain, when analysed in a lab, data on how their diet has changed over the years, and in turn, what that means about the local ecosystem. \"We can tell a lot about past conditions by taking samples from the environment, or from animals,\" Grecian explains. \"For example, the baleen plates of whales can be taken from dead animals, and the chemical signatures will tell you something about the environmental conditions or what the animal was eating.\"\n\nAs a fairly frequent polar visitor, he understands the appeal of these environments – and also the impact. He notes there are choices we can make to reduce the damage to these vital but threatened regions. Polar tourism is showing no signs of slowing down, but Grecian hopes that, with increased awareness of its drawbacks, visitors can make the most ethical choices possible. Here are his suggestions on how to do that.\n\nJames Grecian Marine ecologist James Grecian has spent years studying polar wildlife (Credit: James Grecian)\n\nPlanes, trains or cruise ships?\n\nFirst of all, you'll need to weigh up your travel options to reach the polar region of your choice.\n\nThe problem with a cruise ship is that you're bringing the hotel and all the services with you,\" he says. \"I've heard stories of towns being quite unhappy about the disruption when lots of people disembark. They get all their meals catered on the ship so they won't go to the local cafes. Contrast that to planes – if you fly into an area, you're going to be staying in local hotels, you're going to be using local tour operators. The communities have a chance to benefit economically. But you need to offset that against the massive carbon emissions of planes.\"\n\nWhile ships may seem a greener alternative to flying, global data suggests otherwise. Aviation accounts for 2.5% of CO2 emissions globally, while shipping contributes slightly more at 3% (although most of that is from cargo ships). There's also the noise pollution issue – the hum of ships' engines has been shown to disrupt whales' echolocation ability.\n\n\"There's a horrible video – an animation based on real blue whale migration tracking, and it's a blue whale caught in shipping lanes,\" says Grecian. \"It's like a pinball in a machine; it keeps turning around and turning back because of the amount of noise that the ships produce.\"\n\nSo what's the alternative?\n\n\"Using trains is about a 90% or 95% reduction in CO2, so from a climate perspective, a train to Norway for the fjords is a better option.\" It is possible – but takes much longer – to reach parts of the Arctic by train, even if flights are required for some of the journey. There's direct trains to Narvik in the Norwegian Arctic from Stockholm; from Trondheim to Bodø in Norway or from Helsinki to Rovaniemi in the north of Finland.\n\nAlamy Many travellers don't realise that there is train access to some parts of the Arctic (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOr you could – if you have the money – charter a small sailing boat. \"I know people in the Falklands who sail to Antarctica fairly regularly,\" says Grecian. \"The cost of [a private charter] probably wouldn't be far off the cost of a berth on a fancy cruise ship.\"\n\nThink before you selfie\n\nPolar wildlife is a big draw for visitors, but Grecian cautions against disturbing the very animals people come to see.\n\n\"You must be appreciative of being a guest in that environment and try to treat it with as much respect as you can,\" says Grecian. \"There can be a tendency these days to try and get selfies with animals and that can cause a lot of disturbance. They're not used to seeing people, so give them space. You shouldn't be trying to chase them down.\"\n\nGrecian recommends patience. \"If you sit quietly, some animals are quite curious. I haven't seen penguins in Antarctica but I have in the Falklands, and they came within 3-4m (10-13ft). So if you're quiet and still, you might get a visitor.\"\n\nLocal guides can also provide essential knowledge – plus Grecian says that sometimes it's about noticing the small things. \"Some people say you should always look up, but if you look down, you can see signs of animals. You might see footprints in the mud, or scat that will give you a suggestion of what animals might have passed through.\"\n\nJames Grecian Polar wildlife is a big draw for visitors, but travellers should be respectful and give animals space (Credit: James Grecian)\n\nConsider eating seal\n\nThat might sound drastic, but if you're visiting on land rather than on a cruise, there is a good reason to eat local products. Transporting supplies to these remote areas carries a significant carbon footprint – globally, food production contributes three billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually.\n\nIn Greenland and parts of Arctic Canada, many Inuit communities still subsistence hunt. Their hunting rights are legally protected in Canada and in Greenland, and are regulated to prevent over-hunting. \"The rights of the Indigenous population to pursue traditional hunting practices is enshrined in law,\" says Grecian. \"The meat of a ring seal or a harp seal in Greenland will have a much lower carbon footprint than imported meat or non-native crops.\"\n\nOf course, your personal comfort levels at the idea of eating seal meat are yours to decide, but bear in mind that if you're visiting a majority-Inuit region like Greenland, the alternatives are limited and local meat is the more environmentally-friendly option – a study comparing the carbon footprint of imported meat and local seal in Greenland found seal had the lowest footprint compared to pork and poultry.\n\nThink outside the box when packing\n\nFor the intrepid travellers planning on camping or venturing off the beaten track, it's vital to have the right gear – and not just the obvious things like base layers, shoe spikes and waterproofs.\n\n\"If you're going somewhere particularly cold or out camping in more remote parts, you can hire gear in the country,\" says Grecian. Not only will it make your suitcase lighter; it'll benefit the local economy.\"\n\nAlamy Plan your trip for May or June to see icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBut when it comes to packing for your visit, Grecian offers tips on some practical but often forgotten items. \"Nasal spray,\" he says. \"Cold environments tend to be dry, so the inside of your nose can dry out and can bleed.\" And don't underestimate the strength of polar Sun – Grecian recommends taking factor 50 sunscreen. If you're camping or in other basic, remote accommodation, you might want some creature comforts, too: \"On an expedition, coffee is vital for me. On my last trip I took a moka pot and a French press!\"\n\nSync up with nature\n\nGrecian laughs when I tell him that, on my visit to Greenland, I didn't see a single whale. I went in October – the start of winter, just as humpback whales begin their migration to the Caribbean.\n\n\"If there's a specific activity or animal you want, look up their migration patterns,\" he says. And if it's a natural phenomenon, check when it occurs. \"For instance, a lot of people go to Newfoundland in May or June [to see] grass and flowers against the backdrop of icebergs. If you want to see that you have to go at that specific time of year.\"\n\nHis advice underscores a broader idea: polar travel should be guided by what's best for the natural world, not just what looks good on social media.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todolí is showing me the secret side of citrus – and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\n\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\n\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todolí warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todolí is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\n\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try at Todolí Citrus Fundació, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todolí's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such as Tate Modern in London and Milan's Pirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\n\nLucy Lovell Todolí Citrus Fundació is home to more than 500 varieties of citrus (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nNow, Todolí considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todolí Citrus Fundació came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todolí did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\n\nAround the same time, Todolí was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adrià, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed) El Bulli (once-billed as the world's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todolí asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adrià replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\n\nWorld's Table BBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\nTodolí was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todolí Citrus Fundació is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todolí is blessed with buckets of it.\n\nLucy Lovell Vicente Todolí was inspired by history's most illustrious citrus gardens (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todolí explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\n\nPlan your trip: Tours cost €15 for adults and €10 for children up to 15 and are available from around November to April (depending on when the fruit matures). Book at todolicitrusfundacio.org. The closest airport is Valencia Airport; it takes around an hour to drive from Valencia city centre to Todolí Citrus Fundació.\n\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todolí.\n\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todolí Citrus Fundació seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\n\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is the world's leading exporter of citrus, shipping around 4 million tonnes a year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plants more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todolí Citrus Fundació, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todolí cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\n\nLucy Lovell Tours include an exploratory walk and a tasting of seasonal citrus fruits (Credit: Lucy Lovell)\n\nAs well as tours of the farm, the garden comes alive with events throughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annual Poecítrics festival (14 June 2025), while Cine de Vanguardia is a celebration of experimental cinema.\n\nBack on the tour, and Todolí's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\n\nPeople think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago – Vicente Todolí\n\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todolí's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\n\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London's Toklas restaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible.

        "content": "New details on last interaction U.S. college student had before disappearing in Punta Cana\n\nSearch efforts pressed on into their second week for Sudiksha Konanki, a college student at the University of Pittsburgh who went missing earlier this month during a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.\n\nDetails surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.\n\nKonanki seen on video walking to beach\n\nKonanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.\n\nShe has been missing since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu República hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.\n\nPower outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.\n\nSudiksha Konanki Defensa Civil Dominicana\n\nOne of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.\n\nVideo shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said.\n\nRiibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.\n\nHe is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.\n\nKonanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.\n\nThe Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.\n\nKonanki's family seeking closure\n\nThe Loudoun County Sheriff's Office in Virginia told CBS News that the family of Sudiksha Konanki has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work, and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic on March 6.\n\nThe family provided the request in writing to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, according to LCSO spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.\n\nKonanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nRiibe faces questioning, says he is cooperating\n\nRiibe has been in Punta Cana for questioning since the investigation got underway.\n\nAuthorities confiscated his passport, his attorney Guzmán Ariza said Saturday, noting his client is confined to a hotel with police escorts anywhere he goes. Yeni Berenice Reynoso, the Dominican attorney general, was interrogating Riibe directly, Ariza told CBS News.\n\nRiibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorney.\n\n\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"\n\nOriginally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.\n\nHis family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"\n\nThey also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.\n\nIntensifying search efforts\n\nMore than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.\n\n\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching … because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"\n\nDominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"\n\n, and contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump claims Biden's pardons of Jan. 6 committee members are \"void, vacant\" because they were allegedly signed with an autopen",
        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Washington — President Trump claimed late Sunday that preemptive pardons former President Joe Biden granted to members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol are \"void\" and \"vacant\" because they were allegedly signed with an autopen.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department two decades ago said the president can use an autopen to sign legislation, and the Constitution imposes few limits on the president's pardon power.\n\nIn a post to Truth Social shared just after midnight, Mr. Trump claimed without evidence that Biden himself did not sign the pardons he issued to the members of the Jan. 6 select committee, staff members, and officers from the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department and U.S. Capitol Police who testified before the panel.\n\nBiden signed the \"full and unconditional pardon\" for any offenses arising from the committee's activities on Jan. 19, one day before he left the White House. Others who received preemptive pardons were Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and several Biden family members.\n\nWhat did Trump say about Biden's pardons?\n\nMr. Trump claimed that the pardons his predecessor issued to the select committee members are \"hereby declared void, vacant, and of no further force of effect, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.\" The president wrote that Biden did not sign the pardons and \"did not know anything about them,\" though Mr. Trump did not provide evidence about the circumstances surrounding Biden's clemency decision.\n\nHe said the select committee members \"should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level.\"\n\nA representative for Biden did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe pardons were issued to the House members who served on the panel in response to Mr. Trump's threats on the campaign trail that he would target them if elected to a second term. He had accused the former and current lawmakers of destroying evidence and committing a \"major crime\" during their probe, and told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in December that \"everybody\" who served on the committee \"should go to jail.\"\n\nLast July, Mr. Trump circulated a social media post accusing former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the committee's vice chair, of being \"guilty of treason\" and promoting \"televised military tribunals.\"\n\nThe president's latest message shared to Truth Social suggests that his administration may investigate Cheney and the others who served alongside her on the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nWhat is an autopen signature?\n\nPatented in the early 1800s and used by Thomas Jefferson, the autopen is a device used to replicate handwritten signatures.\n\nPresidents have signed documents and correspondence using an autopen for decades. According to Smithsonian Magazine, Harry Truman was the first president to use autopen, and it was said to have been used frequently by President John F. Kennedy. But Barack Obama became the first president to use an autopen for legislation when he directed it to be used to sign an extension of the Patriot Act while in France in May 2011.\n\nPresident George W. Bush's administration weighed in on the legality of signing legislation with an autopen in 2005, when the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that \"the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.\"\n\n\"Rather, the president may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the president's signature to such a bill, for example by autopen,\" then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Howard Nielson, Jr., wrote in an opinion for the White House counsel.\n\nAs to the pardon power, the Constitution gives the president the exclusive authority to grant clemency, with few limits. And in 2024, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found that pardons or commutations do not have to be issued in writing.\n\n\"We readily determine that nothing in the Constitution restricts the president's exercise of the clemency power to commutations that have been rendered through a documented writing,\" the unanimous 4th Circuit panel wrote.\n\nWhile the court found that a writing \"will generally be the means of proving to a third party that the act has occurred,\" it noted that \"a clemency warrant or, indeed, any writing, is not required for the president to exercise this authority under the Constitution.\"\n\nThe case before the 4th Circuit also involved Mr. Trump and claims raised by James Rosemond, who is serving life sentences for numerous offenses arising from his role in drug trafficking and a murder. Rosemond claimed that Mr. Trump told two supporters, former Cleveland Browns running back Jim Brown and his wife, during a telephone call in December 2020 that his sentence had been commuted.\n\nBut Rosemond was not among those who received written clemency warrants during Mr. Trump's first term, and his petition was listed after the president left the White House in January 2021 as \"pending.\"\n\nThe judges who issued the decision are Steven Agee, appointed by Bush, Stephanie Thacker, named by Obama, and Allison Jones Rushing, nominated by Mr. Trump.",

        "content": "MLB star Shohei Ohtani made a triumphant return to Japan last week for an exhibition game, playing in front of a home crowd for the first time in a major league uniform.\n\nIn a rare interview a day before the game, the Los Angeles Dodgers' phenom spoke about his return to Japan, season expectations and his impact on kids through baseball.\n\n\"Coming back this time and being able to start the season here is really special,\" Ohtani said. \"I hope it becomes an unforgettable year for me.\"\n\nEven for Ohtani, who has become a household name on both sides of the Pacific, it will be challenging to top last year's historic performance. He hit 54 home runs, stole 59 bases and won his first World Series championship with the Dodgers.\n\nHe said their goal as a team is to win back-to-back championships, but on a personal level, Ohtani said, \"this is the year I'm returning as a pitcher, so I want to approach that carefully while also making sure to deliver solid results as a batter.\"\n\nHis rare blend of impressive hitting and pitching has led many to refer to Ohtani as this generation's Babe Ruth. The \"Sultan of Swat,\" Ruth was a transformative figure in the growth of the game in Japan, popularizing the sport during a series of exhibition games held in the country in 1934.\n\n\"Babe Ruth is definitely one of the players I respect, so being compared to or used as an example alongside such a player is something I always feel is very special for me,\" Ohtani said.\n\nAlthough baseball is known as America's pastime, in Japan you'll find advertisements and merchandise featuring Ohtani along the bustling streets of Tokyo.\n\nDodgers' manager Dave Roberts, who has Japanese ancestry on his mother's side, said Ohtani is shouldering the responsibility of an entire nation.\n\n\"We're an hour before the first pitch and this place is jam packed,\" Roberts said ahead of the exhibition game. \"You've got fans all over the world that are here.\"\n\nJust like it did with Babe Ruth nearly a century ago, the MLB is betting on Ohtani's popularity.\n\n\"It really means a lot to me when kids who play baseball say they want to be like Shohei Ohtani. This has happened a lot both when I played in Japan and after I started playing in America,\" Ohtani said. \"I feel a strong responsibility to make sure I don't let those kids down.\"\n\nOhtani's former interpreter\n\nOne year ago Ohtani learned his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, stole nearly $17 million from him to pay off gambling debts.\n\nOhtani has not spoken publicly about the incident since last March and is looking forward to the year ahead.\n\nMizuhara was sentenced in February to more than four years in prison and ordered to pay $18 million in restitution.\n\nThe Dodgers open their season with a series in Japan starting Tuesday against the Chicago Cubs.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nLong-term care insurance costs are increasing, but there are ways to make your policy more affordable now. Getty Images\n\nAs the costs of healthcare and long-term care continue to rise, the need for long-term care insurance coverage has become increasingly critical for seniors. According to data from Genworth, the average cost of a private room in a nursing home is estimated to be about $10,326 per month in 2025, or over $120,000 annually, while in-home care services are estimated at $6,675 monthly, or over $80,000 per year. These costs are only expected to climb over time, making long-term care insurance an essential consideration for seniors planning their financial future.\n\nThe cost of long-term care isn't the only expense that's rising, though. The premiums for long-term care insurance policies have also seen significant increases in recent years. This trend has made it challenging for many seniors to afford the coverage they need and those living on fixed incomes or relying primarily on retirement savings may find it even more difficult to fit these costs into their budgets. The combination of rising premiums and increasing care costs has also led many seniors to search for strategies to make long-term care insurance more affordable.\n\nThe good news is that there are several effective ways seniors can work to lower their long-term care insurance costs in 2025. By taking a proactive approach, older adults can potentially save significantly on the cost of their long-term care policy while still maintaining the coverage they need.\n\nGet a free long-term care insurance price quote today.\n\n5 ways seniors can lower their long-term care insurance costs in 2025\n\nHere are five key strategies to consider when looking to reduce long-term care insurance expenses:\n\nCustomize your elimination period\n\nThe elimination period — which is the time between when you need care and when your policy begins paying benefits — can substantially impact your premium costs. While a shorter elimination period of 30 days means you'll receive benefits sooner, opting for a longer period of 90 or even 180 days can reduce your premiums in many cases. Before choosing a longer elimination period, though, it's important to ensure you have sufficient savings to cover care costs during this waiting period. You may also want to consider coordinating your elimination period with any short-term care coverage you might have through Medicare, which may help bridge the gap.\n\nFind out what your best long-term care coverage options are now.\n\nAdjust your daily benefit amount\n\nRather than selecting the maximum daily benefit amount when purchasing a long-term care insurance policy, carefully analyze your potential care needs and local care costs and use that to inform your coverage amount. For example, choosing a daily benefit that covers 70% to 80% of the average care costs in your area and supplementing the remainder with personal savings or other resources can result in lower premiums while still providing substantial protection against long-term care expenses. Just remember to factor in inflation and regional cost variations when determining your optimal daily benefit amount.\n\nConsider shared care policies\n\nIf you're married, it may be worth considering a shared care policy. These types of policies can offer significant cost savings compared to individual policies, as they create a pool of benefits that either spouse can use, which typically provides more flexibility and better value than two separate policies. While both spouses need to qualify for coverage, shared care policies often cost substantially less than purchasing individual policies. Plus, if one spouse dies without using their benefits, the surviving spouse retains access to the remaining benefit pool.\n\nExplore hybrid policies\n\nHybrid policies, which combine long-term care insurance with life insurance or annuities, have become increasingly popular alternatives to traditional long-term care insurance. These policies can offer premium guarantees and return of premium features that traditional policies don't provide — and they may be worth considering if you're trying to find an affordable solution to long-term care coverage. While hybrid policies typically require a larger upfront investment, they can be more cost-effective in the long run and provide greater financial certainty. They also offer the advantage of ensuring that your beneficiaries receive a death benefit if you don't need long-term care services.\n\nTailor your coverage to specific needs\n\nCustomizing your long-term care insurance policy to include only essential coverage is another way to reduce costs. For example, you have the option to opt for a policy with a lower daily benefit amount, shorter benefit duration or limited inflation protection, all of which can help lower the costs of a policy. While it's crucial to avoid underinsuring, tailoring your coverage to reflect realistic care needs and financial capabilities can make premiums more manageable.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSecuring affordable long-term care insurance is possible, but it requires careful planning and consideration of various policy options and features. By implementing these cost-saving strategies, you can potentially reduce your premium costs while maintaining adequate coverage for future care needs. However, it's essential to work with a qualified insurance professional who can help evaluate your specific situation and recommend the most appropriate coverage options. While reducing costs is important, the primary goal should be securing coverage that provides adequate protection for your long-term care needs while remaining within your budget constraints.",

Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nAmericans are increasingly turning to gold for stability as economic uncertainty continues. Last year, interest in gold catapulted to new heights, primarily due to a weak economy and heavy central bank purchases around the globe. Consequently, the spot price of gold surpassed even the most optimistic experts' opinions, hitting new peaks in 2024 and continuing into 2025.\n\nAmid disappointing economic reports, stocks plummeted last week, and both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.7%, marking their worst one-day decline of the year. Meanwhile, the price of gold is up over $250 per ounce since the start of the year (as of February 27, 2025).\n\nWhile the economy certainly figures heavily, gold's upward trend also reflects rising interest in this precious metal.

Markup is common practice among gold dealers and retailers, and 2% is on the low end of industry standards.\n\nFor example, the spot price of gold is about $2,850 per ounce currently (as of February 27, 2025). At the same time, a 1-ounce, 24-karat gold bar at Costco runs slightly higher at just over $2,900. The Costco member price for a one-ounce gold American Buffalo Coin is marginally higher at about $3,030 and is limited to one transaction per membership with a five-unit daily maximum.

For example, APMEX allows you to return your gold within seven days, subject to certain conditions.\n\nWhat other precious metals does Costco sell (and in what amounts)?\n\nIn addition to gold bars and coins, Costco offers a limited selection of precious metals online, including silver and platinum. You can buy the 2024 one-ounce PAMP American Buffalo silver round in sets of 20. Customer satisfaction is high, with 788 reviews giving the coins an average rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars.\n\nIf you're looking to diversify your portfolio with platinum, Costco offers members a one-ounce PAMP Suisse Lady Fortuna Veriscan platinum bar. This is 99.95% pure platinum and certified for authenticity.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you're considering purchasing gold, Costco may provide a convenient option to buy gold bars and coins. Bear in mind, though, that gold prices fluctuate and the metal's recent historic run doesn't guarantee future results will be the same. But with commodities analysts adjusting their gold price projections for 2025 upward, this may be a good time to purchase the yellow metal before its price rises further.",

Officials said autopsies showed Hackman died of heart disease and Arakawa died from hantavirus, a rare respiratory illness spread mainly by rodents. It is believed Arakawa died days before Hackman and both bodies showed signs of decomposition, officials previously said.\n\nPrior to getting access to phone records, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said earlier this month that Arakawa's last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11. On that day, she had exchanged emails with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store.\n\nCellphone records, however, showed Arakawa made three calls the morning of Feb. 12, the sheriff's office said in a statement. All three calls were to Cloudberry Health, which provides medical concierge services, in Santa Fe.\n\nThere also was one incoming call from Cloudberry Health in the afternoon that Arakawa appeared to miss, the sheriff's office said.\n\nNo other information about the calls was released Monday.\n\nIt remains unclear how and when exactly Arakawa got hantavirus. The disease spreads from animals, mainly rodents, to humans. Hackman tested negative for the virus.\n\nHackman was also suffering from advanced Alzheimer's, which contributed to his death, the state's chief medical investigator said.\n\nOne of the couple's three dogs was also found dead in their home. Arakawa had brought the kelpie mix named Zinna home from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said. The dog likely died of starvation and dehydration, according to a report obtained by The Associated Press.",

        "content": "What to know about Voice of America after Trump guts agency\n\nWhat to know about Voice of America after cuts\n\nWhat to know about Voice of America after cuts\n\nWashington — President Trump's dismantling of the government-funded Voice of America will pave the way for America's adversaries to have greater influence abroad, predicted the agency's director Michael Abramowitz.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump signed an executive order that seeks to make sweeping cuts at the nation's largest international broadcaster, about 1,300 employees, including Abramowitz, learned over the weekend they had been placed on administrative leave, and another 500 contractors were terminated. Mr. Trump accused the news agency, which began broadcasting during World War II, of spreading \"radical propaganda.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News Monday, Abramowitz called VOA \"an incredibly important soft power tool\" for the U.S. and said shuttering it would be a \"self-inflicted blow\" to national security because VOA's news coverage helps to combat Chinese, Russian and Iranian disinformation.\n\n\"If America pulls off the playing field and cedes it to our adversaries, then they're going to be telling the narratives that people around the world are going to be hearing, and that can't be good for America,\" he said. \"They're going to be hearing an anti-America narrative. We need to fight that with truth.\"\n\nVOA reports news about the U.S. in nearly 50 languages — with much of its focus trained on countries that lack a free press. By law, the broadcasts do not air inside the U.S., but news programming is viewed widely — with an audience of about 360 million people per week worldwide.\n\n\"We are getting through to an audience that might otherwise hear propaganda,\" Abramowitz said, adding that many VOA journalists are from countries under authoritarian control. \"The major challenge for the United States in general is this global information war in which countries like China and Russia are essentially really having our lunch. … So, I really feel that we need an organization that is accurate, unbiased, objective, and that tells the truth about America to the rest of the world in the languages that they understand.\"\n\n\"That has never been more important with a sea of lies and disinformation that are going on around the world,\" he added.\n\nStill, Abramowitz acknowledged that VOA, which has a $270 million annual budget, could be reformed and that it should \"not be resistant to change.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying it has to be the way it's always been,\" Abramowitz said. \"Change is great. Change is needed. Change is required.\"\n\n\"I don't personally think it's a waste of taxpayer money,\" he argued. \"Does that mean that it has to be a $270 million budget? Maybe it could be [$240 million], maybe it could be [$200 million]. Look, we are in an era where the taxpayer expects a smaller, more modernized, more streamlined government.\"\n\nHe defended VOA's journalists as non-partisan and said if they harbored any bias, it is against totalitarianism, tyranny and authoritarianism.\n\n\"If you care about a free Iran, if you care about more openness in China, if you care about freedom in Russia, if you care about freedom in Venezuela and Nicaragua, then you have an incredibly important tool in VOA to help push back and to get accurate and objective information into these places that don't have it,\" he said. \"That is incredibly important.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Tel Aviv — A United Nations report published Thursday accuses Israeli military forces of engaging in \"sexual, reproductive and other forms of gender-based violence against Palestinians\" in the war-torn Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank since Hamas' terror attacks against Israel on October 7th, 2023. The U.N. Human Rights Council's report also claims Israel's troops have committed \"genocidal acts\" in the war against Hamas, which was sparked by the U.S. and Israeli designated terrorist group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel.\n\nIn making the latter claim, the council cited what it called the \"systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities\" including maternity wards and Gaza's primary in-vitro fertility clinic.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a statement shared by his office, quickly and angrily refuted the report and attacked the council as an \"anti-Semitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting and irrelevant body.\"\n\nIsraeli soldiers are seen in the city of Tulkarem, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, during a raid, Feb. 6, 2025. WAHAJ BANI MOUFLEH/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty\n\n\"The U.N. is once again choosing to attack the State of Israel with false accusations, including unfounded accusations of sexual violence,\" the statement said.\n\n\"It is one of the worst cases of blood libel the world has ever seen (and the world has seen many),\" said Israel's Foreign Minister Oren Marmorstein in a post on social media. \"It accuses the victims of the crimes committed against them.\"\n\nThe explosive report was published just over a year after a U.N. expert on sexual violence published a paper accusing Hamas of similar actions, saying there were \"reasonable grounds to believe\" sexual violence, including rape and gang rape, had occurred at several locations during the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7 terrorist attack.\n\nThat previous report, by the U.N. special envoy on sexual violence Pramila Patten, said there was also reason to believe sexual abuse of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza was \"ongoing.\"\n\nU.N. experts interviewed dozens of witnesses and reviewed thousands of photos and 50 hours of video shot during the terrorist attack, but Patten said the team had been unable to meet with any survivors of sexual violence.\n\nHamas rejected the allegations.\n\nNavi Pillay, who chairs the U.N. inquiry commission behind the report published Thursday, said it had gathered evidence that \"reveals a deplorable increase in sexual and gender-based violence\" by Israeli forces.\n\n\"There is no escape from the conclusion that Israel has employed sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians to terrorize them and perpetuate a system of oppression that undermines their right to self-determination,\" Pillay said.\n\nThe report documents a broad range of accusations against Israel's security forces, alleging crimes against Palestinian women and girls, but also men and boys in the Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. commission cites incidents of alleged forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment, rape and threats of rape and violence to the genitals, which it claims have become \"standard operating procedures toward Palestinians\" and are \"committed either under explicit orders or with implicit encouragement by Israel's top civilian and military leadership.\"\n\nThe commission's findings were published after two days of public hearings in Geneva that included testimony from purported victims, witnesses, medical staff, academics and lawyers.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration and Israel approached the governments of Sudan and Somalia, and have also been interested in Syria, as potential places to resettle Palestinians from Gaza, according to three sources familiar with the effort.\n\nThe idea of Palestinian resettlement in another country is one of several options the Trump team is chewing over as part of the U.S. president's larger goal of ending Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian enclave.\n\n\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" President Trump said Wednesday, when the Irish Prime Minister was asked during the two leaders' Oval Office meeting by a Voice of America reporter about the president's controversial remarks in February when he suggested taking ownership of Gaza to rebuild it.\n\nMr. Trump made the remarks during a Feb. 4 press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Gaza could be the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"\n\n\" We should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nA combination of Israeli and U.S. officials communicated to Sudan and Somalia, two diplomatic sources confirmed to CBS News. Senior far-right Israeli government officials have already been calling for Palestinians to migrate from the enclave. Mr. Trump's remarks have only emboldened Israel to reach out to other countries to explore opportunities for Palestinian resettlement, one source said.\n\nThree sources familiar with Mr. Trump's idea of resettling Gazans to another country told CBS News that his administration and Israel have also been interested in Syria. One source familiar with the Trump administration's Middle East policy said that the administration has attempted outreach to Syria's new interim government via a third-party interlocutor. Another source from the region told CBS News that Syria's government had been approached, but it was unclear whether there had been any response from Syria to the outreach.\n\nA senior Syrian official told CBS News that they are unaware of any outreach to their government by Israel or the U.S. about resettlement of Gazans.\n\nDahir Hassan, Somalia's ambassador to the U.S., told CBS News that \"neither the U.S. administration nor Israeli authorities have approached the Somali government regarding any proposed relocation of Palestinians to Somalia.\" Hassan also cited concern that \"the dissemination of such unverified information risks fueling recruitment propaganda for extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab, potentially exacerbating security challenges in the region.\"\n\nThe Sudanese government has not responded to a CBS News' request for comment.\n\nSyria's fledgling interim government is just three months old, after toppling Bashar al-Assad and his brutal regime which held an iron fist over the Syrian people for decades. The Arab northeast African nation of Sudan is currently embroiled in civil war and a refugee crisis while suffering pockets of famine. Tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees have sought asylum in Israel over the last two decades, only to be detained in the country's desert-based detention centers or left to live without any formal status. The East African country of Somalia is a fragile, formerly failed state where the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab continues to wage a deadly insurgency.\n\nSince his Feb. 4 news conference, Mr. Trump has suggested Palestinians would have a choice on whether to leave but also indicated that their departure from Gaza could be permanent. In a Fox News interview several days later he said, \"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities, could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they (the Palestinians) are.\" In the same interview, he said that Palestinians wouldn't have the right to return to Gaza under his plan because the enclave \"is not habitable\" and won't be for years to come.\n\nThe United Nations reported in January that over 90% of housing units in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million Gazan civilians have been displaced. Gaza's health ministry says more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in which Hamas killed more than 1,000 Israelis and took roughly 100 more hostage.\n\nMultiple Arab governments, the United Nations and some Democratic lawmakers, quickly denounced Mr. Trump's idea of emptying out Gaza with some defining the idea as ethnic cleansing. Instead, Arab leaders endorsed an alternative Egyptian post-war construction plan for Gaza last week, but the Trump administration and Israel were both quick to reject it, again citing that the Gaza Strip is uninhabitable.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden's administration had been sending U.S. officials on a regular basis to meet with the new Syrian government in Damascus in the lead-up to Mr. Trump's inauguration when the visits stopped. Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, was quick to condemn Mr. Trump's remarks in February, saying that the U.S. president's plan \"is a serious crime that will ultimately fail\". It is unclear what the Trump administration's overall policy toward the new Syrian government will be.\n\n\"The Trump administration should engage directly with the new government in Damascus, particularly after the agreement between Damascus and the SDF (the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces). And to ensure that Iran never again gains a foothold in Syria, for the true, enduring defeat of ISIS, and to conduct a full withdrawal of U.S. forces in the right way unlike what unfolded in Afghanistan,\" Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Washington-based advocacy and humanitarian organization Syrian Emergency Task Force, told CBS News.\n\nIsrael has conducted widespread airstrikes in Syria since December, on what it described as Assad regime weapons sites, and seized territory in the buffer zone between both countries. This past week, Israel struck inside a Damascus suburb, saying it was taking out the headquarters of the Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group that has a substantial foothold in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.\n\nA State Department spokesperson deferred to the Israeli government, and told CBS News that Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff \"continues to work tirelessly towards either an extension of Phase One (of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement) or an advance to Phase Two with these principles in mind\".\n\nThe State Department also referred to remarks by Witkoff from a February Fox News interview in which he said, \"We need to explore new policy prescriptions that ultimately end up in a better life for Gazans and Palestinians.\"\n\nWitkoff also suggested in the same Fox interview that Gaza's entire Palestinian population could go to other Middle East-based Arab nations and other countries beyond the region: \"I think that the president's solution is: how do we address where two million people can go? And I think the obvious answers are: in some respects, Egypt, in some respects, Jordan; but in some respects other countries who have called us up and voluntarily said this is a humanitarian effort, we want to help you\".\n\nAsked by \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday about whether the Trump administration is talking to other countries about relocation of two million Palestinians in Gaza, Witkoff said again \"I think we're exploring, Margaret, all alternatives and options that lead to a better life for Gazans. And, by the way, for the people of Israel. So we're exploring all of those things.\"\n\nMillions of displaced Palestinians already live in surrounding Arab countries as refugees, including in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Far-right Israeli ministers have increasingly called for moving Palestinians in Gaza and also in the West Bank off their land as part of the extreme view it would fulfill a Biblical claim by Jews to the land, and increase Israel's security.\n\nThe Israeli government, the White House and its National Security Council all declined to respond to multiple CBS News requests for comment.\n\nTrump's son-in-law and former advisor Jared Kushner first suggested that Gaza's \"waterfront property could be very valuable, if people would focus on building up livelihoods\" during an on-camera discussion at Harvard University in February 2024.\n\nThe Associated Press was the first to report Friday that the U.S. and Israel had contacted Sudan, Somalia, and also Somaliland, about resettling Palestinians from Gaza.\n\ncontributed to this report.",

        "content": "Millions take on labor and costs of aging loved ones' long-term care\n\nMillions take on labor of aging loved ones' care\n\nMillions take on labor of aging loved ones' care\n\nSince 2017, three generations have taken care of Gladys Ortiz, an 83-year-old woman who lives in Miami and struggles with Parkinson's and dementia. Among them is her daughter, Yanira Portuondo, who views being a caregiver for Ortiz as a second, full-time job.\n\n\"She's having hallucinations. Sometimes she doesn't recognize me. There are days that, going from the living room to the bathroom, she gets lost,\" Portuondo said.\n\nWithout help, Portuondo says her mom \"wouldn't last a week by herself.\"\n\nThe family is luckier than some. Medicaid pays for a home care aide to pitch in 38 hours a week. But that still leaves 130 hours in a week — every week — where the family's spending time and money on her care.\n\n\"Everyone has a life of their own, of course, but the priority is making sure she's okay. We try to make sure that everybody's needs have been met,\" Portuondo said.\n\nNearly 70% of Americans aged 65 and older will require some form of long-term care during their lifetime, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — and the cost of this type of care will likely be difficult to pay out of pocket for many Americans.\n\n\"If you're not a caregiver, you'll either need caregiving or you'll become a caregiver,\" said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, the CEO of AARP.\n\nThat's why the issue is one of the organization's top priorities.\n\n\"I definitely think it's a crisis. How do I make decisions about their care? How do I have the financial means to be able to do this?\" Minter-Jordan said.\n\nIn the U.S., family caregivers, on average, spend a quarter of their income taking care of loved ones, according to AARP.\n\nSome states are looking to help ease the burden. In 2023, Washington state added a payroll tax, money now used to fund long-term care insurance for its residents. A dozen other states are considering variations of long-term care taxes. AARP is also advocating for a $5,000 federal tax credit to benefit caregiving families.\n\n\"It's not going away, and the problem is only going to increase,\" Minter-Jordan said.\n\nMeanwhile, Portuondo worries about the future — in 20 years, will her daughter have to care for her?\n\n\"I could never have imagined I would be in this position ever,\" Portuondo said. \"Most of the time, I'm exhausted. But every time she gives me one of those smiles, you know, it gives me a little strength to keep going.\"\n\nFor millions of American families, caregiving is a labor of love that can demand every bit of both.",

Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year — and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.\n\n\"The bills keep going, whether I've got a fishery or not,\" said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \"There's no season on when people die.\"\n\nCalifornia's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.\n\nCaptain Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat is offering historic tours in place of catching salmon says, \"One is hamburger, and one is filet mignon.\" Noah Berger / AP\n\nSalmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways — something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.\n\nThe dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.\n\nBut salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.\n\n\"We are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\" said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.\n\nDecline in salmon population\n\nThe history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.\n\nCalifornia's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.\n\nJamie O'Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.\n\nCharter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.\n\nWhile fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren't coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.\n\n\"One is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\" said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \"It makes the cash register ring.\"",

        "content": "A 48-year-old woman and 29-year-old man were arrested for allegedly providing illegal abortions and operating a network of unlicensed clinics in the Houston area, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced Monday.\n\nPaxton said that Maria \"Dr. Maria\" Rojas is a known midwife in Northwest Houston and was taken into custody in Waller County.\n\nDuring an investigation, the attorney general's office found that Rojas owned and operated multiple clinics under the names Clinica Waller Latinoamericana in Waller, Clinica Latinoamericana Telge in Cypress, both northwest of Houston, and Latinoamericana Medical Clinic in Spring, just north of Houston.\n\nThe press release from Paxton's office alleged that Rojas' clinics employed unlicensed people who \"falsely presented themselves as licensed medical professionals.\"\n\nJose Manuel Cendan Ley was also taken into custody on Monday and charged with an unlawful performance of an abortion and unlicensed practice of medicine. According to Paxton, Ley performed illegal medical procedures and assisted Rojas in at least one abortion procedure.\n\nRojas is also accused of performing illegal abortions, which violates the Texas Human Life Protection Act.\n\n\"In Texas, life is sacred. I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state's pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individual endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,\" Paxton said. \"Texas law protecting life is clear and we will hold those who violate it accountable.\"\n\nHolly Shearman, a friend of Rojas', told CBS News she spoke with her after the arrest. \"She was adamant she was innocent. Midwives around the state are rallying around her,\" Shearman said.\n\nCourt records did not list an attorney for Rojas who could speak on her behalf, The Associated Press reported. The clinics advertise various services on their Facebook pages, including physical exams, ultrasounds and vaccines, AP noted.\n\nFollowing Rojas' arrest, Paxton's Healthcare Program Enforcement Division filed for a temporary restraining order to shut down all of the clinics Rojas owned and operated.\n\nMarc Hearron, interim associate director of U.S. litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement: \"While details of this case remain unclear, we know that Texas officials have been trying every which way to terrify healthcare practitioners from providing care and to trap Texans. Their ultimate goal is to end abortion access for all Texans entirely—and they will throw people in jail to get there.\"\n\nRubildo Labanino Matos, 54, was also arrested on March 8 in connection to the investigation. Paxton said Matos is a nurse practitioner whose license is currently on probation by the Board of Nursing. He was charged with conspiracy to practice medicine without a license.\n\nWhat is the Texas Human Life Protection Act?\n\nUnder the Texas Human Life Protection Act of 2021, the Texas attorney general has the authority to seek civil penalties of at least $100,000 per violation for the unlawful performance of an abortion.\n\nThe Waller County district attorney referred Rojas' case to Paxton for prosecution.\n\nAttorney Will Vaughn, who is not involved in the case, told CBS Houston affiliate KHOU it could lead to a legal challenge of the state law. \"We can all foresee this being a constitutional challenge at the U.S. Supreme Court, and that would be not so much challenging the conviction, if there were one, but challenging the constitutionally of the statute as a whole,\" Vaughn said.",

        "content": "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.\n\nThe gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nThe HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old — just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.\n\n\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\nHR 8799 (NIRCam Image) NASA\n\nThey used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.\n\n\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.\n\nNormally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.\n\nThis \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.\n\nBut for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.\n\nThis is not easy — Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.\n\nWhile these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.\n\nThere are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.\n\n\"Key piece of proof\"\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.\n\nBecause CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.\n\nJupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.\n\nSo the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.\n\nBut how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.\n\n\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is—or how normal.\"\n\nYoung Gas Giant HR 8799 e (NIRCam Spectrum) NASA\n\nAstronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive — and none of them known to be habitable.\n\nThe \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.\n\nNASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.\n\nLast year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.\n\nBalmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.\n\nLast week the Trump administration announced that NASA's chief scientist has been dismissed, indicating that more cuts were to come for the U.S. space agency.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nInvestors should take a strategic approach to gold in today's high-price climate. Mark Evans/Getty Images\n\nThe gold market is buzzing thanks to record-breaking gold prices. Amid market uncertainty, ongoing inflation and other concerns, investors are looking toward gold as a safe-haven asset. In turn, the price of gold has skyrocketed to $3,000 per ounce. Given gold's remarkable rise, investors have a renewed interest in this precious metal.\n\nIf you've been on the sidelines and want to join the action, you might want to start investing in gold. But as a commodity, figuring out how to buy gold and get started with gold investments can be challenging. We spoke to gold experts about the key factors to consider when choosing a gold firm and how to get started.\n\nExplore your top gold investing options here now.\n\nHow to choose a gold firm to buy precious metals\n\nBefore choosing a gold firm, consider the type of gold investment you want to make. For example, you could stick to gold bars or gold coins.\n\n\"The benefit of the physical is that you actually own it, just like central banks, large governments. Whenever they invest in gold, they actually want to own the product outright,\" says Alex Ebkarian, COO and co-founder of Los Angeles-based precious metals dealer, Allegiance Gold.\n\n\"Gold is not intended to compete against your Apple stocks or Nvidia. Yes, it's not going to pay you dividends or interest in the short term. But its intention is actually to preserve your buying power,\" says Ebkarian.\n\nIf you're not sure about owning physical gold, you can look into alternatives such as gold stocks and gold ETFs. But before deciding on which form to go with, consider your goals.\n\n\"Owning gold in your portfolio, you're buying a fund or an exchange-traded fund. That's for investing. Now, if you're buying physical gold, you have to think of that as purely financial insurance. Sometimes people conflate the two,\" says Jordan Roy-Byrne, author of \"Gold & Silver: The Greatest Bull Market Has Begun.\"\n\nAfter reviewing your gold investing options, you can choose the product that serves your goals. From there, here are things to consider when choosing a gold firm:\n\nBusiness longevity\n\nIf you're new to gold investing, you want to work with a company that has experience in the field and can answer your questions. \"Look for a firm that has some longevity. It's important for investors to validate that through the State registration website and not just rely on Trustpilot,\" says Ebkarian. A gold firm with experience and longevity is more likely to be legitimate and be able to help you get started.\n\nStart exploring your top gold investing options online today.\n\nCustomer reviews\n\nWhen choosing a gold firm, it's key to check out what current and former customers are saying about the business.\n\n\"Look for companies that have a good track record and solid reviews,\" says Brett Elliott, the director of marketing at American Precious Metals Exchange (APMEX).\n\nYou can look at customer reviews on the Better Business Bureau (BBB), Trustpilot and other outlets you trust online. You can also search the company name on various social media platforms to see what users are saying. Another option is to search the company name and look for potential lawsuits and instances of fraud.\n\nTransparent pricing\n\nYou may be able to choose a gold firm online or in person. The key is to choose a gold firm with transparent pricing. Know what you're buying and understand the transaction costs and potential fees. If applicable, review setup fees and maintenance and storage expenses.\n\n\"If you opt for an online experience, you'll have the advantage of transparent pricing, a wider selection of products, and there's no pressure. You can buy when you want, from the comfort of your home and it's easy to research the legitimacy of online stores,\" says Elliott.\n\nDo your homework and compare the gold cost at a firm you're considering with others, to avoid being overcharged. If you're looking at in-person options, some places may be more legitimate than others.\n\n\"If you prefer an in-person experience, local specialty coin shops can be found in most major metropolitan areas. In general, these are safer storefronts to shop at than pawn shops,\" says Elliott.\n\nCollaborative relationship\n\nEbkarian notes that there are different types of gold dealers. You'll have an online dealer that's very transactional. You can go to their website, input your credit card or ACH information, and make a purchase. Those types of dealers are more hands-off.\n\nOn the other hand, Ebkarian says, \"There are boutique firms that actually help the client in terms of the product selection, where and how to store it and essentially help with the exit strategy in terms of in the future if they need the liquidity.\"\n\nThe gold firm you choose should support your interests. The experts we spoke to said it's a red flag if a gold firm is using high-pressure tactics or fear-mongering.\n\n\"You should steer clear of any metals dealer that wants to ignore your desired type of gold purchase and only wants to move you to other types of gold,\" says William A. Stack, financial advisor and author at Stack Financial Services LLC.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nInvesting in gold can be a hedge against inflation. If you're new to gold investing or just getting started, consider options that have a low barrier to entry. \"Gold bullion coins and bars are the most liquid form of gold, with the lowest premiums available,\" says Stack.\n\nWhen choosing a gold firm and making a purchase, Stack recommends asking if the company has vaulting options or services or if you have to find your own. Roy-Byrne recommends that new gold investors do their due diligence and look into multiple gold firms. It's important to look at prices and avoid fake gold potential scams.\n\n\"You have to be careful because you can get really overcharged. And then, if you don't know exactly where it's coming from, it's not actually gold that you bought,\" says Roy-Byrne. In short, do your research and due diligence and don't rush into making an emotional decision. That way you can take advantage of the benefits of gold and avoid potential issues.",

        "content": "Secretary of State says airstrikes on Iran-backed Houthis are \"doing the world a favor\"\n\nWashington — Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who is being detained by federal immigration authorities, is \"going to leave — and so are others.\"\n\n\"We're going to keep doing it,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, served as a negotiator on behalf of students during Columbia University's 2024 student encampment protests. He was arrested March 8 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained in New Jersey before being transported to a federal detention facility in Louisiana. Officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, Khalil's attorney said, but when they were informed that he was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.\n\nRubio said after the arrest that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"\n\nOn Sunday, when asked whether he could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"\n\n\"Negotiating on behalf of people that took over a campus, that vandalized buildings,\" Rubio said. \"That's a crime in and of itself, that they're involved in being a negotiator, the spokesperson.\"\n\nThe secretary of state explained the thought process, which he called \"very simple,\" outlining that when someone entered the U.S. with a visa — whether as a student or tourist — they do so as a \"guest.\"\n\n\"And if you tell us, when you apply for a visa, 'I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events,' that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America,\" Rubio said. \"If you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" March 16, 2025. CBS News\n\nNeither Rubio nor the White House have provided evidence that Khalil supported Hamas in any way other than support for the protesters at Columbia University, and Khalil's lawyers say he is being punished for exercising his right to protest. Khalil's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, and declare that his arrest and detention violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nA top ICE official in New York said in a court filing on Thursday that ICE charged Khalil as \"removable … in that the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that his presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"\n\nRubio said that if Khalil had said he planned to enter the U.S. to become a \"spokesperson and one of the leaders of a movement that's going to turn one of your allegedly elite colleges upside down,\" preventing students from attending classes and resulting in vandalization of buildings, \"we never would have let him in.\"\n\nMore broadly, Rubio said the administration \"every day now\" is approving visa revocations, suggesting that if the visa led to a green card, that has implications for the green card process as well.\n\nAsked whether people with pro-Palestinian views would be the sole target having their visas revoked, Rubio said members of the Tren de Aragua prison gang would be targeted as well, adding that \"we don't want terrorists in America.\"\n\n\"We don't want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,\" Rubio said. \"It's that simple.\"",

The resumption of Israel's war against Hamas on Monday came after almost two months of relative calm in Gaza under a ceasefire the U.S. helped to broker, but which Israel and Hamas could not agree on how to continue.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement its military is \"currently attacking targets of the Hamas terrorist organization throughout the Gaza Strip, with the aim of achieving the war goals as determined by the political echelon, including the release of all our hostages — living and dead.\"\n\n\"From now on, Israel will act against Hamas with increasing military force,\" the prime minister's office said.\n\nThe health ministry in Gaza, a densely populated coastal enclave that has been run by the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization Hamas for almost two decades, said at least 404 people had been killed in Israel's fresh strikes by midday on Tuesday. Video from the territory showed bodies lined up on the floors of hospitals as more casualties streamed in.\n\nMourners gather near the bodies of Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes, at a hospital in Gaza City, March 18, 2025. Stringer/REUTERS\n\nThe statement from Netanyahu's office said Israel was resuming strikes because of Hamas' repeated refusals to release its hostages and its rejection of all offers it received from the U.S. presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and mediators.\n\n\"If Hamas does not release all the kidnapped, the gates of hell will open in Gaza and Hamas' murderers and rapists will meet the IDF with forces they have never known before,\" Defense Minister Israel Katz said. \"We will not stop fighting until all the kidnapped return home and all the war's goals are achieved.\"\n\nOver the weekend, Witkoff warned that Hamas must release living hostages immediately \"or pay a severe price.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday evening that the Trump administration was consulted by the Israelis on their attacks in Gaza.\n\n\"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,\" National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes told CBS News on Monday.\n\nHostages families, U.N. and Egypt condemn resumption of war\n\nThe group representing the Israeli hostages' families condemned Netanyahu's decision to resume the fighting, accusing him of a \"complete deception,\" arguing that it would endanger the remaining captives, and quickly organizing a new protest against the move.\n\n\"The families' greatest fear has come true — the Israeli government has chosen to give up on the abductees. We are shocked, angry and anxious about the deliberate disruption of the process to return our loved ones from Hamas captivity,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.\n\n\"Returning to fighting before the last abductee is returned will come at the cost of the 59 abductees who are still in Gaza and could be saved and returned,\" the group said, accusing Netanyahu's government of having \"refused to declare an end to the war in order to implement the next steps in the [ceasefire] deal and return all the abductees.\"\n\nThe forum dismissed Netanyahu's claim that the resumption of fighting was intended to secure the remaining hostages' release as \"a complete deception.\"\n\nThe forum said \"families are now making their way to Jerusalem and calling on the people of Israel to stand with them\" in a protest on Tuesday. \"There is nothing more urgent than this! With each passing day, the danger to the hostages grows. Military pressure could further endanger their lives and complicate efforts to bring them home safely.\"\n\nUnited Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said he was \"horrified by last night's Israeli airstrikes and shelling in Gaza, which killed hundreds, according to the Ministry of Health in the strip,\" adding that it would \"add tragedy onto tragedy.\"\n\nFarhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the U.N. chief was \"shocked by the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, in which a meaningful number of civilians have been killed. He strongly appeals for the ceasefire to be respected, for unimpeded humanitarian assistance to be reestablished and for the remaining hostages to be released unconditionally.\"\n\nEgypt, which helped negotiate the ceasefire along with the U.S. and Qatar, issued a statement condemning Israel's actions, which it called \"a flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement and a dangerous escalation that threatens to have dire consequences for the stability of the region.\"\n\n\"Egypt reiterates its complete rejection of all Israeli attacks aimed at re-igniting tension in the region and thwarting efforts aimed at calming the situation and restoring stability. It calls on the international community to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli aggression on the Gaza Strip and prevent the region from re-entering a new cycle of violence and counter-violence,\" Egypt's foreign ministry said.\n\nHamas says Israel \"fully responsible for violating and overturning\" ceasefire\n\nHamas also condemned the attacks, accusing Israel of breaching the ceasefire and putting the fate of the remaining hostages in jeopardy.\n\nIn a statement, Hamas said it would hold Netanyahu's government \"fully responsible for the repercussions of the treacherous aggression on Gaza, and for the defenseless civilians and our besieged Palestinian people, who are subjected to a brutal war and a systematic policy of starvation.\"\n\n\"Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement, exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate,\" said Hamas, adding a demand for the U.S. and its negotiating partners Egypt and Qatar to \"hold Netanyahu and the Zionist occupation fully responsible for violating and overturning the agreement.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou said Israel's \"coordination with the U.S. administration prior to the attacks confirms the U.S. partnership in the genocide perpetrated against our people and its role in covering up Israeli war crimes.\"\n\nWhat happened during the ceasefire?\n\nThe new strikes come amid the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and after nearly two months of a ceasefire to pause the 17-month-long war that saw dozens of hostages released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The first phase of the ceasefire ended on March 1 but the pause in major fighting held until Monday.\n\nSince the first phase of the ceasefire ended, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward to a second phase aimed at releasing the nearly 60 remaining hostages and ending the war altogether. Netanyahu had repeatedly threatened to resume the war, and President Trump had also issued several warnings and ultimatums to Hamas — some contradicting the agreed-upon terms of the ceasefire — as negotiations on a second phase of the ceasefire struggled to materialize.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States had been trying to mediate the next steps in the ceasefire.\n\nEarlier in the month, Israel cut off aid into Gaza, stopping the entry of all goods and supplies into the Palestinian territory. Israel said the aid blockade was aimed at pressuring Hamas to accept a proposal drafted by the Trump administration to extend the first phase of the ceasefire. Under the proposal, Israel had demanded Hamas immediately hand over half of the remaining hostages held in Gaza, which would have been a significant change in the terms initially agreed to under the deal brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.\n\nOn Friday, Hamas said it had accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual-nationals who had died in captivity. Netanyahu's office cast doubt on the offer last week, accusing the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.\n\nIn a separate Friday statement, Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed what he said was Hamas' commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.\n\nThe agreement had called for negotiations to begin on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.\n\nThe war erupted with Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, cross-border terrorist attack, which killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a military offensive that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population. The territory's Health Ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children.\n\nWhile the ceasefire largely halted the fighting, Israel has left troops in Gaza throughout the past two months and continued to strike targets, claiming that Palestinians were trying to carry out attacks or approaching troops in no-go zones. A number of strikes earlier Monday killed a total of 10 people, according to Palestinian officials.",

        "content": "A federal judge on Monday canceled a hearing for a doctor who was denied reentry to the U.S. and sent back to Lebanon despite his earlier order to keep her in the country. Immigration officials said they had found photos on Rasha Alawieh's phone that appeared to depict Hezbollah fighters and she allegedly told them she had attended the funeral of a Hezbollah leader.\n\nLawyers for the government said the doctor \"had already departed the United States\" by the time Customs and Border Protection officers at Boston's Logan Airport received notice of Judge Leo Sorokin's instructions, the judge said in a brief order Monday.\n\nAlawieh, a Rhode Island transplant doctor and assistant professor at Brown University, was detained on Thursday in Boston after visiting family in Lebanon, her cousin claimed in a lawsuit challenging Alawieh's detention.\n\nSorokin ordered on Friday that Alawieh be kept in the U.S. and brought to a court hearing on Monday. He wrote Monday morning that \"Dr. Alawieh is now in Lebanon.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on Monday that Alawieh had told Customs and Border Protection officers that she traveled to Beirut to attend the funeral of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.\n\n\"A visa is a privilege not a right—glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied. This is commonsense security,\" the DHS statement continued.\n\nAccording to court documents filed by the government, Alawieh was questioned by a CBP officer about photos on her phone that appeared to depict Hezbollah fighters. Alawieh allegedly said they were shared by others within WhatsApp messaging groups of friends and family.\n\nAlawieh allegedly said her interest in Nasrallah was in his standing as a religious figure within the Shia Muslim community, as opposed to his role as a political leader, according to the documents.\n\nCBP spokeswoman Hilton Beckham said those \"who promote extremist ideologies or carry terrorist propaganda are inadmissible to the U.S., plain and simple.\"\n\n\"Officers act swiftly to deny entry to those who glorify terrorist organizations, advocate violence, or openly support terrorist leaders and commemorate their deaths,\" Beckham said. \"Anyone found with extremist materials linked to a U.S.-designated terrorist group will be removed.\"\n\nAn attorney for Alawieh's cousin did not immediately reply to questions sent by CBS News. On Sunday, Sorokin ordered the government to explain before the now-canceled Monday hearing why Alawieh was removed. Lawyers for her family claimed the government \"willfully\" disobeyed his order by sending Alawieh outside the U.S.\n\nThe government made a filing under seal, and Sorokin said in his latest order that the filing included an affidavit from a CBP watch commander and government attorneys said at \"no time would CBP not take a court order seriously or fail to abide by a court's order.\"\n\nAlawieh has been in the U.S. since 2018 on an H-1B visa. A transplant nephrology specialist, she was involved with the care of patients before, during and after receiving kidney transplants.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Alawieh's cousin claims she was issued a visa on March 11, and her family has not been provided with information explaining why Alawieh was detained or removed. President Trump's crackdown on immigration has recently targeted university-affiliated visa holders who the administration claims have taken actions that are contrary to the national interest.\n\nIn a statement, Customs and Border Protection said \"arriving aliens bear the burden of establishing admissibility to the United States.\"\n\nCBP went on to say that its officers \"adhere to strict protocols to identify and stop threats, using rigorous screening, vetting, strong law enforcement partnerships, and keen inspectional skills to keep threats out of the country.\"",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Sen. Chuck Schumer on Israeli strikes, his leadership in the Senate and new book\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued Tuesday that he remains the \"best leader for the Senate\" despite backlash from some Democrats over his decision to allow a Republican-led measure to advance, avoiding a government shutdown.\n\n\"We have a lot of good people,\" Schumer said on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"But I am the best at winning Senate seats.\"\n\nSchumer initially signaled last week that his caucus would fight back against a partisan measure to keep the government funded. But a day later, he reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage. The move has prompted frustrations among some within his party, and questions about his leadership, but Schumer has repeatedly defended his decision.\n\n\"I knew when I took this vote there'd be a lot of protests, but I felt I had to do it for the future, not only of the Democratic Party, but the country,\" Schumer said, adding that \"as bad as that CR bill was — and it was bad — a shutdown is 10 times worse.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on \"CBS Mornings,\" March 18, 2025. CBS News\n\nSchumer said a shutdown would have given \"sole power\" to the executive branch and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to determine what remained open and closed during a shutdown, saying \"within two weeks, everyone would have been howling.\"\n\nThe New York Democrat said he and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries had a strategy to try to get a bipartisan bill to keep the government funded. But they didn't expect that House Republican leadership would be able to keep its conference together to advance the partisan continuing resolution — a heavy lift that defied the typical political dynamics, with conservatives who routinely oppose continuing resolutions joining their party to support the measure.\n\nSchumer said a \"shutdown would have been the greatest disaster,\" putting the government in the hands of \"evil, nasty, nihilistic people\" like Musk, President Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought.\n\n\"We would have had half the federal government we have now,\" Schumer said. \"So I thought I did the thing a leader should do: Even when people don't see the danger around the curve, my job was to alert people to it — and I knew I'd get some bullets.\"\n\nOn the question of his leadership, Schumer said he isn't going anywhere, citing his record as leader on winning Senate seats, including in 2021, when Democrats secured a majority in the upper chamber with two surprise runoff victories in Georgia. Schumer came to Congress in 1981, representing New York in the House before being elected to the Senate in 1998. He's led Democrats as leader in the Senate since 2017.\n\nSchumer said Democrats are fighting back against the Trump administration with a message focused on how GOP leaders want to \"screw every average American so they can get tax cuts for the rich,\" saying the strategy is \"beginning to work.\"\n\n\"If we keep at it everyday, relentless fighting and showing how they're hurting people so badly, Trump's numbers will get much lower, and his both popularity, but also his effectiveness will decline,\" Schumer said. \"I believe that strategy will work.\"\n\nTuesday's interview was held one day after Schumer postponed events to promote his book, \"Antisemitism in America: A Warning,\" this week, citing security concerns following backlash from his move to keep the government funded. Schumer had a number of events scheduled this week in Maryland, New York City, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania and California.\n\nSchumer said he wrote the book aimed at a number of audiences — including his \"friends on the left.\" He noted that while \"we've always seen antisemitism on the right,\" more recently \"a lot of it's trickled over to the left.\"",

There are as many as 18 people on this Detail, which is ridiculous!\" Mr. Trump wrote, noting that the former president's son was vacationing in South Africa, where his wife is from. \"Likewise, Ashley Biden who has 13 agents will be taken off the list.\"\n\nSecret Service chief of communications Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement the agency was \"aware of the President's decision to terminate protection for Hunter and Ashley Biden. The Secret Service will comply and is actively working with the protective details and the White House to ensure compliance as soon as possible.\"\n\nSecret Service protection for a president's family typically ends when that leader departs the White House, while former presidents and their spouses receive Secret Service protection for life.\n\nBiden extended protection for his adult children through July via an executive order, according to multiple sources familiar with the protective agreement.\n\nIt's not unusual, however, for a president before they leave office to authorize an extended period of protection for their children.\n\nMr. Trump did the same for his four adult children and two of their spouses before his first term ended in 2021, multiple sources confirmed to CBS News. Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump received six months additional protection following their father's exit for the White House. By law, Secret Service was required to protect Mr. Trump's youngest son, Barron Trump, until he turned 16.\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics, a watchdog organization, released Secret Service records showing that Mr. Trump's children's travel cost taxpayers more than $140,000 in the first month after he left the White House.\n\nMr. Trump's predecessors also extended protection for their children.",

        "content": "With a fresh crew now aboard the International Space Station, the four fliers they are replacing — including long-delayed Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams — undocked early Tuesday for a long-awaited return to Earth, finally closing out an extended 286-day space odyssey.\n\nLaunched last June aboard Boeing's problem-plagued Starliner capsule, Wilmore and Williams are sharing the 17-hour ride home with Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, who were launched to the station last September aboard the same SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying all four of them home.\n\nThe Crew 9 Dragon drifts away from the International Space Station after undocking early Tuesday. On board: Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams NASA\n\n\"On behalf of Crew 9, I'd like to say it was a privilege to call the station home, to live and work and be a part of a mission and a team that spans the globe, working together in cooperation for the benefit of humanity,\" Hague radioed as the Crew Dragon drifted away from the station.\n\nHague, left, and Gorbunov, right, monitor the Crew Dragon's departure from the International Space Station . NASA\n\n\"To our colleagues and dear friends who remain on the station ... we know the station's in great hands. We're excited to see what you guys are going to accomplish.\"\n\nSplashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast south of Tallahassee is expected at 5:57 p.m. EDT.\n\nWearing white SpaceX pressure suits, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams wave farewell to their space station crewmates before floating into their Crew Dragon ferry ship for a long overdue return to Earth. NASA\n\nFor Wilmore and Williams, the long overdue trip back to Earth will wrap up a repeatedly extended mission totaling 286 days and 7 hours spanning 4,576 orbits and 121 million miles. They originally expected to spend just eight days or so in orbit.\n\nHow will the astronauts return to Earth?\n\nAfter bidding their station crewmates farewell, Hague and company floated into their Crew Dragon and undocked from the ISS Harmony module's space-facing port at 1:05 a.m. EDT.\n\nSixteen hours later, the flight plan called for an automated seven-and-a-half-minute de-orbit thruster firing starting at 5:11 p.m. to slow the ship down for re-entry.\n\nAfter a 27-minute free fall, the spacecraft was expected to plunge back into the discernible atmosphere for the final 12 minutes of the descent, making a parachute-assisted splashdown off the Florida panhandle's Gulf Coast a few minutes before 6 p.m.\n\nA SpaceX recovery ship will be stationed nearby to haul the spacecraft on board so the crew can be helped out of the Crew Dragon's cabin and onto stretchers for initial medical checks.\n\nCBS News will have live coverage of the astronauts' return starting at about 5:50 p.m. EDT. Watch in the video player above or download the free CBS News app for your mobile or streaming device.\n\nWhy were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?\n\nWilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.\n\nNASA launched the next crew rotation mission — Crew 9 — in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew 9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.\n\nWilmore and Williams, in white pressure suits, join Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, wearing pressure suit undergarments, pose for photos before boarding their Crew Dragon and undocking from the International Space Station early Tuesday. NASA\n\nBy keeping them in space as part of Crew 9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.\n\nNASA cleared the way for Crew 9's return to Earth by launching four replacements — Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi — last Friday.\n\nNormal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.\n\nWearing dark blue flight suits, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi are welcomed aboard the space station after arrival early Saturday. With Crew 10 on board, Crew 9, including the two Starliner astronauts, were cleared for return to Earth. NASA\n\nAll station astronauts spend two hours a day exercising to minimize bone and muscle loss in the weightlessness of space. Even so, Wilmore and Williams will face extensive rehabilitation over the next several weeks and months as their bodies re-adapt to the unfamiliar tug of gravity.\n\nHague and Gorbunov, who spent spent 171 days in space, will re-adapt more quickly, perhaps, but both will require physical therapy.\n\nWas this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?\n\nWhile 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight — 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.\n\nIronically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.\n\nAs a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.\n\nGiven Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

Both traditional and hybrid long-term care policies have pros and cons, and we spoke with three insurance experts to help you determine which could be better for your individual circumstances.\n\nSee how much a long-term insurance plan could cost you here.\n\nLong-term care vs. hybrid long-term care insurance: Which is better?\n\nTo more accurately determine which of these insurance types could be better for you, it first helps to understand what they are and how each operates.\n\nTraditional long-term care insurance is a standalone policy that covers a wide range of services, including skilled medical care and supportive services in nursing homes, community-based facilities, or even in your own home.\n\n\"Traditional long-term care insurance was typically an insurance policy that is, let's say, a one-trick pony,\" says Eric Mangold, the founder of Argosy Wealth Management. \"Meaning that it was a policy that was designed to help pay for some or all of the costs associated with long-term care. But there were usually some underlying disadvantages.\"\n\nTraditional long-term care insurance operates under a use-it-or-lose-it system, similar to your home or auto insurance. If you never need to file a claim, you'll never recoup any of the premiums you paid over the years.\n\nAnother downside to these policies is that premiums can — and often do — increase over the life of the policy. So, while you might choose a policy based on what you can afford, you could end up paying far more.\n\nHybrid long-term insurance, on the other hand, ties the benefits of life insurance and long-term care insurance together. These plans are more expensive than traditional long-term care, typically requiring a large lump-sum payment or installment payments paid over a shorter period (rather than the full policy term). But in return, you get a long-term care policy combined with life insurance.\n\n\"Since they were built on a life insurance foundation, if you never needed care, if you never used it and passed away, your beneficiaries would receive the death benefit,\" says Mangold.\n\nSome hybrid long-term care insurance policies even offer a guaranteed death benefit, meaning your beneficiaries could still receive a small sum (often 10% of the total death benefit) when you die if you've already utilized your long-term care coverage.\n\nCompare your long-term and hybrid care insurance insurance options here to learn more.\n\nWhen long-term care insurance could be better\n\nBecause traditional long-term care insurance policies focus on one specific service, they may have more robust coverage options than you could get with a hybrid policy. For that reason, they may be a good option if long-term care coverage is your only priority.\n\n\"Traditional long-term care insurance is best for those who want dedicated, robust coverage for extended care needs later in life,\" says Brandy Burch, the CEO of Benefitbay, an insurance company.\n\nAdditionally, because traditional policies tend to be cheaper than hybrid ones, they're also a good option for policyholders who are on a budget but who still want protection in case their health declines and they need long-term care.\n\n\"It also works well for those who can budget for annual premiums and are focused on securing high-quality care rather than building wealth transfer opportunities through their insurance,\" says Burch.\n\nIt's especially ideal for those who are on a budget but are okay with the use-it-or-lose-it nature of traditional long-term care insurance.\n\nWhen hybrid long-term care insurance could be better\n\nHybrid long-term care insurance is a better option for those who want the protection that long-term care coverage offers, but who don't want to feel like they're wasting their premiums if they don't end up needing care services during their lifetime.\n\n\"You could tap into it for LTC expenses if you need it, or else it can behave like life insurance or an annuity that your heirs or you still benefit from,\" says Lily Vittayarukskul, the CEO and co-founder of the long-term care insurance planning company Waterlily.\n\nThe stable premiums on hybrid policies are a major advantage. But because they tend to be more expensive than traditional policies, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, they're often better for those who can afford the large upfront cost.\n\n\"Hybrid policies tend to have more stable premiums, which can help with budgeting, but the trade-off is often a higher cost for the same LTC benefit level than you'd find with a dedicated LTC policy,\" says Vittayarukskul.\n\nHow to choose your long-term care insurance policy\n\nIf you're in the market for long-term care insurance, it's important to compare your options and choose the right policy for your situation. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\nConsider the best type of policy for your situation: It's important to fit your long-term care policy into your overall financial plan, so be sure to consider your budget, health status, and other insurance coverages. A financial planner can advise you on the best type of policy for your situation. Get multiple quotes: Premiums may vary significantly across different insurers and different types of long-term care policies. Get quotes from several providers. Read the fine print: While cost is important, it's not everything. Other factors to consider and compare include benefit triggers Explore other options: It's possible to be denied long-term care insurance life insurance riders\n\nThe bottom line\n\nMany seniors today will need long-term care services at some point in their lives, but many can't afford the high cost out of pocket. That's where long-term care insurance comes in. While traditional long-term care policies were the norm for decades, hybrid policies, which offer a death benefit if you don't use your entire long-term care coverage limit, have become increasingly popular. There's no type of policy that's right for everyone. Instead, the policy type that's right for you depends on your age, health status, budget, and other key factors. So be sure to explore both to determine which is most applicable.\n\nHave more questions? Learn more about your long-term care insurance options here.",

        "content": "The family of missing college student Sudiksha Konanki has asked authorities that she be declared deceased, the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office in Virginia told CBS News, almost two weeks after she disappeared while visiting Punta Cana for spring break.\n\nThe family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.\n\nThey also expressed gratitude to investigators for their work, and a desire for closure following Konanki's disappearance, the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nKonanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe student, 20, was last seen in the early morning hours of March 6 on a beach near the resort town's Riu República hotel where she and her friends and had been staying. Surveillance video from the night she disappeared showed Konanki walking toward the beach with a group of three women and two men, one of whom authorities identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, who is presumed to be the last person to see her alive. She and Riibe stayed behind on the beach after the four others left, a police source told CBS News, citing video footage.\n\nRiibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and struggled in rough waters. He said he believed Konanki made it out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.\n\nKonanki lives in the D.C. suburb Loudon, Virginia, and attends University of Pittsburgh. Her disappearance sparked a missing persons investigation and massive search effort by authorities in the Dominican Republic and the United States, with agencies probing land, sea and air in hopes of locating her. The Dominican Republic National Police said they created a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, while Interpol issued a missing person alert to police around the world.\n\nAuthorities in the U.S. and the Dominican Republic have repeatedly emphasized that this is not a criminal investigation. Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso said investigators are exploring whether Konanki may have drowned but have not ruled out the possibility of foul play.\n\nSince Konanki vanished, Reynoso has directly interrogated Riibe, a student at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota who is originally from Iowa, his attorney Guzmán Ariza told CBS News. Authorities confiscated Riibe's passport while holding him for questioning in Punta Cana and assigning him \"permanent\" police escorts, Ariza said.\n\nAnna Schecter, Andre Tinoco and Manuel Bojorquez contributed reporting.",

        "content": "The remains of a second Indigenous woman murdered by a convicted serial killer have been found in a landfill in central Canada, authorities confirmed Monday, after another victim's remains were identified earlier this month.\n\nMarcedes Myran was one of the Indigenous women slain three years ago by Jeremy Skibicki, who is serving multiple life sentences after being convicted of four murders last year.\n\nSkibicki met his victims in homeless shelters, in a case seen as a symbol of the dangers faced by Indigenous women in Canada, where they disproportionately fall victim to violence, termed a \"genocide\" by a national public inquiry in 2019.\n\nTestimony at Skibicki's trial said he raped, killed and dismembered Myran and another woman, Morgan Harris, in 2022.\n\nAuthorities believed their remains were dumped at the Prairie Green Landfill site, north of Winnipeg, the capital of the province of Manitoba. They had been searching the site for months.\n\nOn a tree out front of Camp Marcedes, located next to the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, a photo and red dress signify the loss of Marcedes Myran with a call to action in searching the landfills for her remains from Downtown Winnipeg, Canada on September 27 2023. Shay Conroy for The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nLast month, Manitoba authorities announced the discovery of two bodies.\n\nMorgan Harris's remains were identified on March 7.\n\nFederal police in Manitoba on Monday confirmed the other set of \"human remains found in the Prairie Green Landfill search have been identified as those of Marcedes Myran of Long Plain First Nation,\" a statement said.\n\nThe families of Harris and Myran had pushed authorities in Manitoba to search for the bodies.\n\nThe body of another of Skibicki's victims, Rebecca Contois, was found in a separate landfill and in a garbage bin, while the remains of a fourth unidentified victim in her 20s are still missing.\n\nIn December 2022, Winnipeg Police Chief Danny Smyth wrote an open letter to Indigenous leaders, acknowledging the \"unimaginable\" pain surrounding the case.\n\n\"The investigation involving the murders of Rebecca Contois, Marcedes Myran, Morgan Harris, and Buffalo Woman has been one of the most complex and important homicide investigations during my tenure,\" Smith wrote. \"I have heard the calls from the families, the Indigenous leadership, and the community. I understand your calls; the pain and sorrow is unimaginable.\"\n\nIndigenous women represent about one-fifth of all women killed in gender-related homicides in the country — despite comprising just 5% of the female population.\n\nA similar crisis exists in the U.S., where Native American women are disproportionately targeted in murders, sexual assaults and other acts of violence, both on reservations and in nearby towns.\n\nThere were more than 5,700 reports of missing Native women and girls in 2016, according to the anti-sexual assault organization RAINN, which cites statistics from the National Crime Information Center. The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimated more recently that roughly 4,200 cases of missing and murdered Indigenous people remain unsolved.",

        "content": "How to protect yourself from carbon monoxide poisoning as travel ramps up\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning Americans to take precautions while traveling abroad on spring break.\n\n\"Whether it's families looking to escape the final throes of winter or a college student seeking a brief respite from the rigors of academic life, know that the risks are there,\" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Akil Davis said in a news release Monday. \"Maintain vigilance throughout your travels and be prepared to contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate should the need arise.\"\n\nThe warning comes after University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki disappeared while on a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.\n\nThe spring break travel season covers most of March and April. Airlines and airports said they expect to be busier this season, CBS News reported, with the Transportation Security Administration saying it expects a 5% jump in flyers over last year.\n\nFBI tips for staying safe on spring break\n\nThe FBI recommends that travelers \"be vigilant of their surroundings and use caution\" while traveling. Their advice includes establishing points of contact for family members to reference in case of an emergency, using only authorized taxis or shuttles, and being on the lookout for suspicious activity, including someone following you or \"new acquaintances who probe for information about you or who attempt to get you involved in what could become a compromising situation.\"\n\nThe FBI also recommends avoiding illegal and \"improper\" actions as well as \"offers of sexual companionship,\" which may lead to a \"room raid, photography and blackmail.\"\n\nThe agency urges people to avoid traveling alone, especially after nightfall.\n\nTravel advisories\n\nAnyone traveling abroad should check the travel advisories for their intended destination, the FBI says. Travel advisories range from Level 1 to Level 4, and are regularly reviewed and updated for each country. The levels are based off several factors, including crime levels, threats of terrorism, civil unrest, health concerns and the possibility of a natural disaster, CBS News previously reported. A country may have multiple advisories, if certain regions are known to be more of a risk than others.\n\nIn Level 1 countries, travelers should exercise normal precautions and be aware that all international travel includes some level of risk. Level 2 recommends increased caution due to \"heightened risks to safety and security.\" Level 3 suggests Americans reconsider travel to that destination, and Level 4 advises against any travel to that location.\n\nThe map below shows the advisories by country. Hover over a country to see what level advisory it has and search for a specific nation in the table.\n\nCarbon monoxide safety\n\nWhile it was not mentioned in the FBI's statement Monday, another possible threat travelers should be aware of is carbon monoxide. The invisible, odorless gas is the leading cause of poisoning deaths in the United States, killing more than 400 Americans each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overseas, the deaths of American tourists in Mexico and the Bahamas have been linked to carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nTo avoid carbon monoxide poisoning, experts suggest ensuring your hotel room or rental has at least one carbon monoxide detector. Travelers can also bring a portable detector. If a carbon monoxide detection alarm begins going off, experts advise getting out of the building immediately.\n\nSymptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, weakness, chest pain and confusion, CBS News has reported, although not all people who encounter the gas experience symptoms.",

Kennedy. Mr. Trump, who was speaking at the Kennedy Center Monday, added that he didn't believe the material, \"approximately 80,000 pages,\" would be redacted.\n\n\"I said during the campaign that I'd do it, and I'm a man of my word,\" the president said of the impending release.\n\nLast month, the FBI said it had discovered roughly 2,400 records related to the assassination during a search stemming from Mr. Trump's executive action ordering files related to the 1963 killing to be declassified.\n\nThe bureau said that the documents, which have been inventoried and digitized, \"were previously unrecognized as related to the JFK assassination case file.\" The FBI in February was transferring the records to the National Archives and Records Administration to be included in the ongoing declassification process that has been ongoing. The bureau did not say what the records contain.\n\nIn his first week in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that called for the declassification of these files and also those related to the assassinations of his brother Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe order gave the director of national intelligence and attorney general 15 days to present a plan to the president for the \"full and complete release of records\" related to Kennedy's assassination.\n\nCongress in 1992 enacted the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which required all assassination-related material be kept in a single collection within the National Archives and be publicly released. The law gave federal agencies 25 years to process and disclose the documents, with exceptions. The collection at the National Archives consists of more than 5 million pages of records.\n\nThe National Archives has over the last three decades made material related to Kennedy's assassination available to the public, with the latest batch disclosed in August 2023. The agency said in December 2022 that more than 97% of records in its Kennedy collection are available to the American people.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "A federal judge admonished the Justice Department Monday for disobeying his order to turn around two planes en route to El Salvador that were carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members. He also demanded explanations about removal flights ordered since President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act Saturday.\n\nDuring a hearing on the Trump administration's compliance with his order, D.C District Chief Judge James Boasberg demanded answers by Tuesday at noon to clarify what occurred Saturday — both before and after he blocked the government's removal flights. He asked the government whether additional planes have left the U.S. with Tren de Aragua gang members, and he wants a timeline showing when the flights took off from the U.S. and landed in El Salvador and a count of remaining members of the gang in U.S. custody.\n\nBoasberg also demanded detailed timing on when President Trump's order invoking the Alien Enemies Act was signed and went into effect. The 1798 act is a wartime authority allowing the president to detain and deport noncitizens. Mr. Trump is utilizing the act to detain and deport all Venezuelan migrants 14 years of age and older who are suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nA Justice Department attorney argued that because the judge did not put his order demanding the planes to return to the U.S. in writing, the government was not bound by it, but he added that even if the order had been written, the president had the authority to keep the flights en route to their final destination.\n\n\"You're telling me your first argument is when I said those things, because I didn't say it in a minute order that the plaintiffs didn't have to turn around, you didn't have to comply?\" Boasberg said. \"You're saying that you felt you could disregard it because it wasn't in a written order?\"\n\nThe attorney did not provide details about how many deportation flights left Saturday, claiming that there were \"operational issues\" prohibiting him from answering. When Judge Boesberg mentioned the two flights that departed Texas at 5:26 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. local time, the attorney said that he was \"not at liberty\" to provide information about the flights.\n\nIt sparked a tense back and forth between Judge Boesberg and the government over whether or not it was asserting the flight information was classified.\n\nThe Justice Department also argued that because the planes were over international waters and airspace by the time the judge ordered them to turn around, that Boasberg no longer had jurisdiction over the migrants.\n\nThe judge responded that his order applied to the planes, regardless of where they were in the air.\n\nThe Trump administration said the two planes had left before the judge made his decision, and a third plane left for El Salvador shortly afterwards, though details about the passengers on that plane are unclear.\n\nDespite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday,137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said.\n\nThe judge's ruling responded to a federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials filed Saturday by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.\n\nBoasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days. The Justice Department appealed that decision, arguing the D.C. federal court has no authority over the case because none of the five men are being held in the District of Columbia.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X Saturday night that the \"written order and the Administration's actions do not conflict,\" and said a \"single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil.\"\n\nWrapping up the hearing, Boasberg said he'd issue a written order quickly because \"apparently my oral orders don't seem to carry much weight\" with the Justice Department.\n\nBefore the hearing, the Justice Department filed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals requesting Boasberg's removal from the case, arguing that his actions in the case have been an \"inappropriate exercise of jurisdiction\" and claiming he had followed \"highly unusual and improper procedures,\" in his hearing on Saturday evening.",

While Putin said he accepted the idea for a ceasefire in principle, he did not commit to a deal and said more discussions were needed.\n\n\"The idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it,\" Putin said during a news conference in Moscow last week. \"But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.\"\n\nMr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin last week.\n\n\"We made a lot of progress in that meeting,\" Witkoff said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday. \"We talked about a lot of specifics, and I point to the large gap that existed between Ukraine and Russia prior to the inauguration, and where we are today. We have narrowed the issues between both of these parties, making a lot of progress, in my opinion.\"\n\nWitkoff said he expected the call between Mr. Trump and Putin to be productive.\n\n\"I think this is going to be a very positive and constructive call between the two men, between the two presidents,\" Witkoff told Brennan.\n\nMr. Trump said he expected his call with Putin to involve discussions of specific assets.\n\n\"We'll be talking about land. We'll be talking about power plants. That's a big question,\" Mr. Trump said aboard Air Force One. \"But I think we have a lot of it already discussed, very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets, and they've been working on that.\"\n\nAfter launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia illegally annexed four regions, which it does not fully control: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Zaporizhzhia is where Europe's largest nuclear plant is located.\n\nRussia also annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.",

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nIt's important to understand who may qualify for long-term care insurance coverage if you're planning to buy a policy this year. Getty Images\n\nAs Americans live longer and healthcare costs grow, planning for future care needs has become increasingly important. After all, nearly 70% of Americans aged 65 and older will require some form of long-term care during their lifetime, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — and the cost of this type of care will likely be difficult to pay out of pocket for many Americans. As of 2025, the average cost of a private room in a nursing home exceeds $120,000 per year, and home health aide services can cost upward of $75,000 per year. These types of expenses are only expected to grow over time, highlighting the financial hurdles that many seniors currently face, or will face, in terms of long-term care.\n\nAnd, as the population ages, the price of long-term care won't be the only thing that grows. Demand for long-term care services is also expected to grow substantially. By 2030, all baby boomers will be at least 65 years old, which will almost certainly lead to a sharp increase in the need for assisted living, nursing homes and in-home care. With these services becoming more expensive, long-term care insurance offers a way to mitigate the financial burden while ensuring access to quality care.\n\nBut if you plan to purchase this type of coverage, understanding who qualifies for long-term care insurance coverage is an important part of the decision. Below, we'll break down who exactly qualifies for long-term care coverage this year.\n\nSee how long-term care coverage could benefit you now.\n\nWho qualifies for long-term care insurance coverage?\n\nLong-term care insurance is generally available to adults aged 18 and 75, though the sweet spot for purchasing coverage typically falls between ages 50 and 65. That said, insurance companies will also evaluate several key factors when determining eligibility, which typically include:\n\nHealth status\n\nApplicants must be in relatively good health to qualify for this type of coverage. To determine if this is the case, insurance companies will typically review your medical records and may require a physical examination. Pre-existing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or a history of strokes could result in a denial. Less severe health issues, like well-controlled diabetes or high blood pressure, may be acceptable but could result in higher premiums.\n\nCompare your long-term care insurance options online now.\n\nActivities of daily living\n\nInsurers will also assess your ability to perform basic activities of daily living (ADLs) independently. These include bathing, dressing, eating, transferring (moving from bed to chair) and maintaining continence, among other tasks. Those who already need assistance with these activities typically won't qualify for long-term care insurance coverage.\n\nCognitive function\n\nMental acuity is a crucial factor in terms of qualifying for coverage. Those showing signs of cognitive decline or memory problems are less likely to be approved, as these conditions often lead to long-term care needs.\n\nAge\n\nWhile coverage is generally available up to age 75, long-term care insurance premiums increase significantly with age, and qualifying becomes more difficult. Some insurers may limit new policies to those under 70 or even 65.\n\nWhen should you purchase long-term care insurance?\n\nIf you want to get the timing right for when to purchase long-term care insurance, it may help to weigh these factors:\n\nCost vs. benefits: Premiums increase significantly with age, so purchasing coverage in your 50s rather than your 60s can result in substantially lower premiums over the life of the policy. However, this means paying premiums for a longer period before benefits might be needed.\n\nPremiums increase significantly with age, so purchasing coverage in your 50s rather than your 60s can result in substantially lower premiums over the life of the policy. However, this means paying premiums for a longer period before benefits might be needed. Health changes: Waiting too long\n\nFinancial readiness: Premiums must be paid consistently to maintain coverage, so ensure you can afford them\n\nPremiums must be paid consistently to maintain coverage, so Family history: If longevity and health conditions requiring long-term care run in your family, purchasing coverage earlier might be prudent.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nLong-term care insurance can provide valuable protection against the high costs of extended care needs, but qualifying for coverage requires meeting specific health and age criteria. The best candidates are typically those in good health who purchase policies in their 50s or early 60s, have stable financial resources to maintain premium payments and want to protect their assets from potential long-term care costs.\n\nBefore applying, though, be sure to carefully review different insurance companies' qualification requirements and policy options. And, remember that while long-term care insurance premiums can be substantial, the cost of long-term care without insurance can be financially devastating, making this protection worth considering for many who qualify.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Trump says \"nobody is expelling any Palestinians\" from Gaza in proposed U.S. takeover plan\n\nDuring a meeting on Wednesday with Ireland's leader Michel Martin, President Trump made an offhand remark that was quickly picked up in the Middle East as a major change in his stance on the war-torn Gaza Strip and its roughly 2 million Palestinian inhabitants.\n\n\"Nobody is expelling any Palestinians,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.\n\nThat came after he repeatedly said that under his own proposal to rebuild Gaza, all of its residents would be moved out, while the U.S. moved in to \"take over\" the coastal territory to turn it into a luxury real estate development. Just a month ago, Mr. Trump was clear that, in his mind, not only would Palestinians need to leave Gaza, they would not be permitted to return.\n\nThat plan was roundly and clearly rejected by Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan, which Mr. Trump had said would take in the displaced masses.\n\nEgypt, which has led efforts to present an alternative plan for Gaza that does not involve displacing Palestinians, welcomed the change in tone by Mr. Trump.\n\n\"Egypt expresses its appreciation for the statements made by U.S. President, Donald Trump… regarding the non-displacement of the residents of the Gaza Strip,\" the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday. \"Egypt affirms that this position reflects an understanding of the importance of avoiding further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the Strip and the necessity of working towards finding just and sustainable solutions to the Palestinian cause.\"\n\nA boy looks over a newly established tent camp for displaced Palestinians whose homes were damaged by Israeli army strikes in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City on Friday, March 7, 2025. Jehad Alshrafi / AP\n\nHamas, the U.S. and Israeli designated terrorist organization that sparked the war in Gaza with its brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, also cautiously welcomed the shift in Mr. Trump's rhetoric.\n\n\"If Trump's statements represent a retreat from the idea of Palestinian displacement, then they are welcomed,\" a statement from the group's spokesperson said.\n\nMr. Trump's remarks came Wednesday after his senior envoy Steve Witkoff met with the foreign ministers of five Arab nations in Qatar to discuss Gaza's post-war future. That future, regardless of what reconstruction plan is eventually implemented, can only start taking shape once there is an official end to the war, however.\n\nA fragile truce between Israel and Hamas has largely kept the peace since January 19, but the two sides have not yet agreed on whether to extend the first phase of the agreement, or to move onto a second phase as originally envisioned. The dialogue in Doha, Qatar, involving delegations from the host-nation as well as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and the U.S. is aimed at pushing the process forward – and keeping the guns silent in Gaza.\n\nThe five Arab nations involved have pushed the Egyptian-crafted alternative to Mr. Trump's \"Riviera of the Mideast\" proposal in their talks with American officials.\n\nThe Arab plan, the rough outline of which officials shared with CBS News earlier this month, carries a price tag of $53 billion and envisions all of the enclave's residents remaining in Gaza throughout the years-long reconstruction. The Trump administration initially rejected the plan, with U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes issuing a statement saying it failed to \" address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.\"\n\n\"President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" Hughes said at the time, adding: \"We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"\n\nIt appeared on Wednesday, with Mr. Trump's remarks at the White House, that those further talks with America's regional partners may have convinced the White House that displacing the entire population of Gaza was not a tenable proposition.\n\n\"The Arab foreign ministers presented the Gaza reconstruction plan, which was approved at the Arab Summit held in Cairo on March 4, 2025,\" the five Arab nations that met in Doha said in a joint statement shared Wednesday. \"They also agreed with the U.S. envoy to continue consultations and coordination on this plan as a basis for the reconstruction efforts in the sector.\"\n\nThat Egyptian plan has been adopted by the broad Muslim solidarity group of 57 countries known as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It envisions the Gaza Strip eventually being run by the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, not by Hamas.\n\nThat will likely prove an ongoing point of contention as the PA holds little support among Palestinians and has been dismissed as a potential future Gaza administrator by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, showing there's still much negotiation ahead if Mr. Trump is to make good on his vows to end the crisis in the heart of the Middle East.",

        "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com/",
        "content": "Johannesburg — It sounds like the plot of a horror movie. Researchers stuck on a remote research base in Antarctica send an email out to the world, pleading for help as a colleague is accused of assault.\n\nBut this was real. An urgent email was sent by a researcher at South Africa's isolated Sanae IV base in Antarctica accusing a man, one of the nine team members, of becoming violent and mentally unstable. In the email sent to a journalist at South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, the researcher, who has not been identified publicly, requests immediate action to ensure the team's safety.\n\nAccording to the Times, the researcher alleged that the male team member had physically assaulted a colleague, threatened to kill a different colleague and sexually assaulted another. However, South African officials later said the report of a sexual assault was not correct.\n\n\"His behavior has become increasingly egregious, and I am experiencing significant difficulty in feeling secure in his presence,\" the newspaper quoted the researcher as writing, adding: \"It is imperative that immediate action is taken to ensure my safety and the safety of all employees.\"\n\nSouth Africa's Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment released a statement saying the alleged assault at the base was reported on Feb. 27, triggering a response plan that saw the government agency use \"trained professionals\" to mediate. The department said those mediators continued to engage with the team at the base on \"an almost daily basis.\"\n\nAccording to the agency, the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended.\"\n\nThe statement went on to say the male perpetrator had written an apology to the victim and was willing \"to verbally apologize to other team members.\"\n\nSouth African Environment Minister Dion George told CBS News on Tuesday that \"the situation at the base remains calm and all is under control.\"\n\nA file photo shows the Antarctic coastline and surrounding waters. iStock/Getty\n\n\"I will be keeping close contact with the base to ensure it remains that way,\" said George, adding that a \"team of psychologists and other experts\" were also in \"direct and constant\" contact with the team.\n\nWhen pressed on what else he could do to ensure the safety of the team, George said he was \"considering available options.\"\n\nThose options may be few, as severe weather conditions have completely cut the base off from the sea. The base sits on stilts near a cliff edge — a row of buildings that the team will remain in until December, the heart of the Antarctic summer, when a ship is set to depart from South Africa to make the near-15-day journey to retrieve them.\n\nAn emergency evacuation, at significant cost, would be required to get the team out before then.\n\nThe environment department said it also activated a legal \"labor relations process to investigate the [claim of] physical assault and alleged sexual harassment.\"\n\nThere have been several incidents in the past with team members at the remote base threatening violence, and at least two other team members have been evacuated during previous expeditions.\n\nThe latest incident has fueled discussions about the reliability of the psychometric tests given to team members before they're deployed to the isolated station. Scientists sent previously to the base and others like it have spoken of how lonely it is, surrounded by white and silence and cut off from the rest of the world, and of the toll that can take on someone's mental health.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "Kherson, Ukraine CNN —\n\nKherson is eerily quiet. The main square of this port city is almost entirely empty. There is little danger from traffic for the lone cyclist or the old woman who passes by, using her cane as she walks as quickly as she can to the grocery store.\n\nThis is a city on the front lines of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Russian troops are just across the Dnipro River, less than three miles from Ukrainian forces and the beleaguered population they’re charged with defending.\n\nAt the grocery store, large barriers protect the entrance, wood covering the glass doors. Residents — mostly older women and men — nip inside to see what is on the shelves, buying necessities for the day before heading back to shelter and home.\n\nBroken glass at the grocery store. Shattered windows and damaged buildings are everywhere in Kherson. Scott McWhinnie/CNN\n\nKherson was the first major city to fall to the Russian forces that invaded Ukraine. When it was liberated eight months later, joyous crowds draped in blue and yellow Ukrainian flags took to the streets, hugging and kissing soldiers, and singing as car horns blared.\n\nThe flags are still out — a large one flying on top of a downtown bank building, smaller ones lining the streets and even painted on lampposts. But the noise and the joy are gone.\n\nWith Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin set to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine, the fate of this city and its people hangs in the balance. The illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 gave Putin a swath of land on the Black Sea south of Kherson, but the full-scale invasion that began in 2022 saw Moscow’s forces grab more and more territory.\n\nMany of the buildings show the scars of the years of conflict — windows blown out and boarded up, chunks of rubble strewn around from shells hitting concrete.\n\nThe shells still fly overhead, producing deafening and destructive thuds when they land.\n\nBut it’s the whirr of drones that terrifies people here these days.\n\n“It’s impossible to explain how scary it is,” says Olena Vassilievna Shigareva. “It flies, it buzzes, you don’t see it. And when you spot it, it stops and starts following you wherever you go.”\n\nShigareva says she and another woman were walking together when they were targeted by drones, in what some Kherson residents call a “safari” on them. Dozens of videos on the Telegram social media channel appear to show the phenomenon of armed camera drones chasing civilians and dropping explosives, set to music.\n\n“They could see we were women, not soldiers,” Shigareva says. “We didn’t do anything to them. It’s just horror.”\n\nOlena Vassilievna Shigareva says she was walking with another woman when she was attacked by a Russian drone. Scott McWhinnie/CNN\n\nShigareva talks from her hospital bed, where she is being treated for a damaged knee and shrapnel in her leg.\n\nThe hospital is one of the few places we see where there is noise and movement, with medics hustling down the hallways to treat the war wounded — the majority, civilians hit by drone strikes.\n\nBeds are crowded into available rooms, each with a patient. An elderly woman has her ankle pinned together; a teenager called Boris says he was on a bus when it was hit; and a man looks where his legs used to be — they were amputated high on both thighs.\n\nRoman Mrochko, the mayor of Kherson, works in a basement, underground away from the danger of the drones. He says as many as 100 drones can be flown toward his city each day. “A large number are suppressed by our jammers but of course there are drones… that reach the target and hit our people,” he tells CNN. “We call it a hunt for civilians. The Russians send fresh drone units to Kherson, and they train by attacking civilians with drones,” he says.\n\nIntentionally directing attacks against civilian infrastructure and civilians who are not directly taking part in hostilities is considered a war crime under international law.\n\nRussia has been repeatedly accused of targeting Ukrainian civilians by Kyiv, its Western allies, the International Criminal Court and the United Nations. Throughout the war, Russia has repeatedly denied the accusations, despite substantial evidence to the contrary.\n\nA woman accepts a box of food before hurrying back into the safety of her house. Scott McWhinnie/CNN\n\nThe exposed eastern outskirts of the city are where most of the drone attacks occur, its residents effectively pinned down. Early morning is the safest time to be on the streets, so it’s when volunteers are out delivering boxes of food aid from the back of a truck.\n\nWomen emerge nervously from homes, bundled up against the cold. Cardboard boxes are placed into grateful arms and then they return quickly inside. No one really wants to stop and talk.\n\nAnd for good reason. After just a few minutes, the word comes in that drones have been launched from the Russian side of the river. In this ghost city, it is too dangerous to be outside. The aid workers secure the undelivered boxes and return to their depot. The other families on their route may go hungry this day or have to take their chances outside.",

        "title": "Trump’s tariff problem: He might need a third or fourth term to reindustrialize America",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "New York CNN —\n\nPresident Donald Trump is on a mission to restore American manufacturing prowess by using his favorite tool: massive tariffs on foreign imports.\n\n“The higher it goes, the more likely it is they’re going to build,” Trump told leading CEOs last week at The Business Roundtable, referring to tariffs. “The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That’s a bigger win than the tariffs themselves.”\n\nReindustrializing America could create many jobs and revive communities crushed by the shutdown of factories as blue-collar jobs were shipped overseas.\n\nTariffs could help encourage some investment in domestic manufacturing. Yet economists and trade experts say that a more dramatic revival of US manufacturing would take considerable time – far more than what’s left in Trump’s second term.\n\nThat’s because while tariffs can kick in with little notice, factories can’t be put into operation overnight. It can take years – and billions of dollars – to build cutting-edge factories to assemble cars, appliances and computer chips.\n\n“The sort of reindustrialization that’s being talked about isn’t the product of months or years,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. “It’s the product of decades.”\n\nThis appears to be a crucial obstacle in Trump’s efforts to make manufacturing great again.\n\nCEOs need clarity on not only where tariffs will be tomorrow but where they’ll be years from now. Otherwise, they can be reluctant to spend billions of dollars to relocate factories to the United States, where labor costs are typically much higher.\n\n“We make decisions around aluminum production that have a horizon of 20 to 40 years,” Alcoa CEO Bill Oplinger said at a conference last month. “We would not be making an investment in the United States based on a tariff structure that could be in place for a much shorter period of time.”\n\nHow long will tariffs last?\n\nThese days, CEOs have little confidence where tariffs will be at the end of the week – let alone the end of the decade, or even multiple decades away.\n\nIf Trump were to keep high tariffs in place for his entire second term – and that’s a big if – there’s no guarantee his successor would do the same starting in January 2029.\n\n“Do you build a widget plant in America when you don’t know if the next president will kill the tariff?” Alan Blinder, economics professor at Princeton University, told CNN in an interview.\n\nOf course, term limits are a reality of the White House.\n\nPresidents often set in motion long-term policies, not knowing whether the next president will double down on them or undo them.\n\n“I don’t want to argue against doing something that may take ten to fifteen years,” said Blinder, who served as the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve in the 1990s. “But don’t do stupid things that take ten to fifteen years to come to fruition because those are the ones that are likely to get erased by the next administration.”\n\nShipping containers at Evergreen Shipping's Everport Terminal Services (ETS) terminal at the Port of Los Angeles in Los Angeles, California, on Thursday, February 20, 2025. Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n‘Inferior cars at higher prices’\n\nBlinder pointed specifically to tariffs that would undermine decades of integration in North America by the auto industry.\n\nIn the closely interconnected North American economy, auto parts often cross the border multiple times before a car lands at a dealership in the United States. There is no such thing as an all-American car.\n\nTrump has argued that automakers can avoid his tariffs by moving factories back to America.\n\n“He told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the United States of America, where they will pay no tariff,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this month. “That’s the ultimate goal.”\n\nBut that’s easier said than done.\n\nIt can take years between when an auto factory gets announced and cars start rolling off the assembly line.\n\nBlinder, the Princeton economist, said that even if tariffs can break up North American supply chains, there would be consequences.\n\n“It would be costly to Americans. They would get inferior cars at higher prices. And it would probably take a decade or two to get there,” said Blinder.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai acknowledged that boosting US manufacturing would be a “step-by-step process.” He said that while eventually the goal is to expand manufacturing production capacity, the initial focus is on ramping up existing facilities that are underutilized due to “unfair dumping” of cheap steel and aluminum.\n\n“Since President Trump was elected, industry leaders have responded to President Trump’s America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy with trillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of new jobs,” Desai said in a statement to CNN. “President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term.”\n\nA lengthy process\n\nMary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said it’s hard to know precisely how long it would take to reshore manufacturing at the scale Trump has talked about because it’s never been attempted in a globally integrated country like the United States.\n\n“But it cannot happen quickly,” Lovely said. “It would take well beyond the next four years.”\n\nLovely added that while high tariffs will likely incentivize some new investment in the United States, there will also be pain as farmers and other exporters lose customers, lay off workers and go bankrupt in the trade war.\n\n“This is not going to reindustrialize America,” Lovely said.\n\nSome supporters of Trump’s trade strategy acknowledge it will take time to reverse the loss of manufacturing jobs, but they argue that it’s a worthy effort anyway.\n\n“We’ve been rowing in the wrong direction on trade and industrial policy for 30 or 40 years. And no, it’s not going to change overnight. But that’s not an excuse to do nothing,” Mark DiPlacido, a policy adviser with conservative group American Compass, told The Washington Post earlier this month.\n\nMarket and economic pressures\n\nYet it’s unclear how much patience Americans will have, politically or economically, for a sustained trade war.\n\nTrump’s trade war is barely a month old, and it’s already facing pressure from some in Washington and on Wall Street.\n\nInvestors are frustrated with the on-again, off-again nature of the tariffs. The uncertainty has sparked concerns of an economic slowdown or even a recession.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 lost $5.3 trillion in market value between its record high on February 19 and the market close on March 13, when it closed in a 10% correction.\n\nThe mood is darkening on Main Street, too.\n\nSmall business uncertainty about the economy surged to its second-highest level in records that go back to 1973. Consumer sentiment plunged in March to two-year lows, the latest in what Apollo Global chief economist Torsten Slok has described as an “alarming” deterioration in consumer confidence.\n\nEven some pro-Trump economists are growing worried about the state of the economy.\n\n“I am really concerned about consumer confidence. That’s a bad sign. It means people are going to stop spending,” Stephen Moore, a senior visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told CNN in a phone interview.\n\nMoore, a former senior economic adviser to Trump, added that he’s “concerned” about the stock market drop and fears the US economy is likely to shrink during the first quarter.\n\nAlthough Moore acknowledged that the risk of a recession has gone up, he is hopeful pressure on the economy will subside as tariffs go away.\n\n“I do not believe a recession is inevitable. If we get a trade deal done, we could see a big snapback,” Moore said.\n\nOf course, that implies tariffs don’t last long enough to convince automakers and other manufacturers to dramatically reshore jobs.",

        "content": "Summary Harvard announced tuition will be free for students from families earning $200,000 or less starting next fall.\n\nStudents from families earning $100,000 or less will also receive coverage for housing, health insurance and travel costs.\n\nIt's part of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which aims to make education more accessible to people of all economic backgrounds.\n\nMIT and the University of Pennsylvania recently announced similar tuition-free policies for students from families earning under $200,000.\n\nCurrently, 55% of Harvard undergraduates receive financial aid, which comes from a variety of sources including endowment, alumni gifts, tuition revenues and grants.\n\nCNN —\n\nHarvard undergraduate tuition will be free for students from families making $200,000 or less, starting next fall, the university announced Monday in its latest effort to provide an Ivy League education to those who might otherwise be priced out.\n\nAttending Harvard will be completely free for students from families making $100,000 or less, with the university committing to cover housing, health insurance and travel costs between campus and home.\n\nUndergraduate tuition at Harvard College was more than $56,000 this year, while total cost of attendance was almost $83,000, according to the institution’s financial aid website. (Harvard College is the undergraduate institution at the university.)\n\nThe announcement builds on the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which was launched in 2004 to make college affordable for people of all economic backgrounds. Since its inception, the initiative has raised its income threshold several times, and currently, students from families with incomes under $85,000 attend Harvard for free.\n\nHarvard is among several higher education institutions expanding their financial aid offerings to support lower- and middle-income families.\n\nIn November, MIT announced that undergraduates from families earning below $200,000 would attend tuition-free starting next semester, while those with incomes under $100,000 will receive full coverage.\n\nSimilarly, the University of Pennsylvania said in November it will cover tuition costs for students from families earning up to $200,000 annually. The University of Texas system pledged undergraduates from families with incomes below $100,000 will attend tuition-free, starting next fall.\n\nHarvard said Monday it wants to specifically entice middle-income families. While it did not indicate the source of funds to cover the tuition, the university has a whopping $53.2 billion endowment for fiscal year 2024.\n\n“Putting Harvard within financial reach for more individuals widens the array of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives that all of our students encounter, fostering their intellectual and personal growth,” university President Alan M. Garber said in a statement.\n\nCurrently, 55% of undergraduates receive financial aid, with the average family contribution standing at $15,700 in 2023-2024, said the statement.\n\nThe financial aid website says scholarship funds come from “a variety of sources, including Harvard endowment funds, gifts from alumni, general tuition revenues, and federal and state grants.”\n\nThe rising cost of going to college is hardly a secret.\n\nBetween 1980 and 2020, the average price of tuition, fees, room and board for an undergraduate degree increased by 169%, according to a report from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThe average tuition and fees at US private colleges grew to about $43,000 a year, according to data collected by US News & World Report.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nAnother potent storm is putting millions in the United States in harm’s way again, just days after a deadly, cross-country storm left a trail of destruction in its wake.\n\nThe next storm won’t be a carbon copy of the last one, but it will once again spawn severe thunderstorms and its powerful winds could trigger dust storms, fast-moving fires and a blizzard in the central US.\n\nThe storm will start to come together in the Rockies Tuesday afternoon, reach the Plains by night and strengthen considerably through Wednesday as it tracks into the Midwest.\n\nPowerful wind will be the most widespread threat, and gusts stronger than 40 mph are possible over more than 1,300 miles from Texas to Minnesota Wednesday, capable of damaging trees and power lines.\n\n‘Wildfire outbreak’ possible\n\nThe weather pattern in the US has been stuck in a loop since March began, so the risks involved in the upcoming storm will sound like a broken record.\n\nGusty winds will blow over parts of the southern Rockies and Plains on Tuesday, especially from the late morning on, as the storm starts to take shape. This will ramp up the risk of wildfire spread to its highest level, causing the Storm Prediction Center to warn of a “wildfire outbreak.”\n\nA level 3-of-3 fire weather risk exists Tuesday for parts of New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma from the SPC. Vegetation there is primed for ignition and spread, and widespread wind gusts up to 60 mph could turn any spark into an all-out blaze. A few gusts could approach 80 mph, especially in eastern New Mexico.\n\nGusty winds will keep the fire risk alive Wednesday and a level 2-of-3 fire weather risk is in place for parts of western and southern Texas where frequent gusts of 30 to 40 mph are likely in the afternoon. Stronger winds will blow farther north where the storm intensifies, but the greatest risk of wildfire spread will stay confined to tinder-dry areas of the southern Plains.\n\nA wildfire burns south of Langston, Oklahoma, on Friday, March 14, 2025. Alonzo Adams/AP\n\nThese renewed wildfire risks are happening after deadly fires broke out over the weekend.\n\nMore than 130 wildfires fueled by high winds from the last storm damaged at least 400 homes and killed four people in separate counties in Oklahoma, according to the state’s Department of Emergency Management.\n\nStrong winds will also kick up dirt and debris and could create blinding dust storms this week. Dust storms make it incredibly hard to see more than a few feet and send air quality levels plummeting.\n\nAt least eight people in Kansas and four people in Texas were killed in car crashes Friday when dust storms blotted out the sky and sent visibilities to near zero.\n\nSmashed vehicles and scattered debris are shown in the aftermath of a serious crash during a dust storm on Interstate 27 near Canyon, Texas, Friday. Jon the Storm Chasing Guy\n\nBlizzard conditions return\n\nThe storm will start dumping snow on parts of the Plains Tuesday night and over some of the Midwest by Wednesday morning. Spots caught under the heaviest snow from far eastern Nebraska to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula could get more than half a foot through Wednesday night.\n\nA few inches of March snow aren’t typically enough to cause major disruptions in the Plains and Midwest, but add prolonged gusty winds to the equation and then there’s a problem.\n\nBlizzards happen when snow and strong winds combine and create whiteout conditions for a few hours. Whiteout conditions — like dust storms — also make it incredibly hard to see more than a few feet ahead.\n\nWhiteouts are possible even in spots where just an inch of snow falls because of the strength of Wednesday’s gusts — more than 50 mph in parts of Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota.\n\nTravel in blizzard conditions could be “treacherous and potentially life-threatening,” warned the National Weather Service in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nThunderstorms could deliver damaging winds\n\nThunderstorms will rumble Wednesday from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast and some could become severe.\n\nThe severe thunderstorm threat is nowhere near as significant or widespread as the tornado outbreak spawned by this weekend’s deadly storm, but storms could hinder recovery efforts where people are trying to pick up the pieces and threaten some of the same areas impacted Friday.\n\nSome thunderstorms will kick off Tuesday night in parts of the Midwest. Most storms won’t be severe, but a few, especially in Iowa, could dump hail into Wednesday morning.\n\nAdditional thunderstorms — some severe — will form Wednesday afternoon in parts of the Midwest, stretch through Tennessee and into parts of Mississippi and Alabama into the overnight. Strong wind gusts and hail are the main threats, but a tornado cannot be ruled out.",

        "content": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nOfficials in Beijing and Hong Kong spoke out Tuesday against a proposal to sell ports in the Panama Canal to a consortium led by BlackRock, sending shares in the Hong Kong-based conglomerate that owns the ports plummeting.\n\nIt’s unclear how regulators could interfere with the plan, which was announced earlier this month, given that the ports that CK Hutchison intends to offload to the group led by the US investment giant are located outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. However, observers have said Beijing’s sharp criticism of the deal means it may not ultimately go through.\n\nWhen asked at a regular press conference whether China was investigating CK Hutchison’s planned sale, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, declined to answer directly. But she made Beijing’s view clear.\n\n“I would like to emphasize that China has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries,” she said.\n\nHer comments echoed those of John Lee, Hong Kong’s leader, who earlier on Tuesday said: “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic and trade relations.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that several Chinese government agencies, including the top market regulator, had been instructed by state leaders to study the deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations.\n\nCNN has reached out to CK Hutchison for comment. Its shares fell as much as 5% Tuesday due to jitters about the future of the proposal, which is currently an “agreement in principle.”\n\nEarlier this month, the group of investors led by BlackRock said it would spend $22.8 billion to buy the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the Panama Canal from CK Hutchison, as well as its controlling interest in 43 other ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries.\n\nHong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a special arrangement with Beijing, which granted the city autonomy and wide-ranging freedoms unavailable in mainland China. But a national security law that came into effect in 2020 has transformed Hong Kong’s political, legal and business landscape.",

        "content": "Punta Cana, Dominican Republic CNN —\n\nThe parents of missing US college student Sudiksha Konanki are asking authorities in the Dominican Republic that she be officially declared dead, nearly two weeks after she went missing while on spring break in Punta Cana.\n\nMeanwhile, the last person believed to have seen her alive is asking a court to grant him his freedom, challenging authorities’ treatment of him since the 20-year-old woman’s disappearance on March 6.\n\nInvestigators believe Konanki drowned “and no evidence of foul play has been found,” Subbarayudu and SreeDevi Konanki wrote in a letter to the government of the Dominican Republic provided to CNN by a source close to the investigation.\n\n“Given these circumstances, and after much deliberation, we request that the police department proceed with the legal declaration of her death,” the letter reads.\n\n“Initiating this process will allow our family to begin the grieving process and address matters related to her absence,” Konanki’s parents wrote. “While no declaration can truly ease our grief, we trust that this step will bring some closure and enable us to honor her memory.”\n\nA hearing is set for 2 p.m. local time Tuesday for Joshua Steven Riibe, the last person known to have been with Konanki before she disappeared, according to court documents obtained by CNN. The 22-year-old from Rock Rapids, Iowa, who is a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, filed a habeas corpus petition in a Dominican Republic court, claiming his rights were violated by prosecutors, police and the hotel where he was staying, according to the documents.\n\nAuthorities in the Dominican Republic confiscated Riibe’s passport, a source close to the investigation told CNN, and he has remained under police surveillance, even though he is not considered a suspect in Konanki’s disappearance and has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nDominican Republic Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso interviewed Riibe over the weekend for more than six hours, according the source. A previous statement from Riibe’s parents said their son has been taken to the police station for interrogation multiple times.\n\nRiibe’s parents also claimed he was detained “under irregular conditions” and questioned without official translators or legal counsel until March 12. Prosecutors declined comment when asked by CNN about those allegations.\n\nMichael Chapman, the sheriff of Loudon County, Virginia, where Konanki’s family lives, told CNN that Riibe had been “very forthright with our detectives.” The sheriff said he didn’t see “any inconsistencies” with what Riibe said.\n\nThe entire contents of Riibe’s habeas corpus request are expected to be made public at the Tuesday hearing.\n\nKonanki’s last known moments\n\nKonanki, described by her father as an “ambitious” student who planned to study medicine, arrived in Punta Cana on March 3. She traveled with five other female students from the University of Pittsburgh, according to the Loudon County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nRiibe said he first met Konanki in the hotel when he and his friend introduced themselves to her group. The two friend groups went together to the bar, where they drank until “someone suggested we go to the beach,” Riibe said in his interview.\n\nIn the early hours of March 6, she was seen on surveillance footage drinking with five women and two men in the Riu República Hotel bar. In the video, Konanki is seen wearing a white cover-up as she hugs and talks with her friends. Riibe is seen several feet away, bent over and stumbling on the lawn outside the bar.\n\nThen, at 4:15 a.m., a surveillance camera captured the group, including Konanki, entering the beach, police said.\n\nJust before 5 a.m., surveillance footage shows five women and one man leaving the beach, two sources close to the investigation told CNN. Konanki was not among them.\n\nThe screenshot is believed to be from the last known video of missing US college student Sudiksha Konanki among a group of friends before she disappeared on March 6. CNN blurred portions of this image. EXCLUSIVE: Noticias SIN\n\nDuring his fourth interview with prosecutors on Wednesday, Riibe described a harrowing attempt to save Konanki after they were jostled by the wave and she got tired of swimming.\n\n“It took me a long time to get her out. It was difficult,” Riibe said, according to Noticias SIN. He said he was trained as a lifeguard but worked at pools, not at the beach.\n\n“I was trying to get her to breathe the whole time. That didn’t allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water. I could have lost consciousness several times. When I finally reached the ground on the beach, I held her in front of me.”\n\nHe said he last saw Konanki when she was walking in knee-deep water.\n\n“The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn’t hear her answer because I started vomiting up all the seawater I had swallowed.”\n\n“After vomiting, I looked around, and I didn’t see anyone. I thought she had grabbed her things and left,” Riibe said.\n\n“I felt very sick and tired. I lay down on a beach chair and fell asleep because I couldn’t go far.”\n\nThe sun and biting mosquitoes woke Riibe up, he said, and he went to his friend’s room to get his phone and then went to his room to sleep.\n\n“I was sleeping in the room and my friend asked me if I had seen her; I told him no, I thought she had gone to her room,” Riibe said. His friend told him Konanki never returned to her room, which Riibe said “surprised” him.\n\nMembers of the Armed Forces of the Dominican Republic observe images transmitted by drones as part of the ongoing search operation of Sudiksha Konanki, 20, a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing March 6 while on spring break, in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Erika Santelices/Reuters\n\nWhen Konanki didn’t return to her room, her friends searched for her before notifying authorities, according to the law enforcement source. The group then reported her missing to hotel staff around 4 p.m. Thursday, according to the Riu hotel chain.\n\n“After I saw her walk away while she was walking in the water, I never saw her again,” Riibe told Dominican news station Noticias SIN.\n\nKonanki’s sarong-style cover-up was found on a lounge chair on the beach, but there were no signs of violence, a source familiar with the investigation previously told CNN.\n\nKonanki’s disappearance comes nearly two months after four tourists drowned in Punta Cana, according to the Dominican Republic’s civil defense agency, at the same beach where she was last seen. Strong currents swept the tourists off the Arena Gorda beach, where the Riu República Hotel is located, the civil defense agency said January 18 in a Facebook post.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.",

        "content": "CNN —\n\nA high stakes $300 million lawsuit brought by a giant pipeline company against the environmental group Greenpeace is drawing to a conclusion in a small courthouse in North Dakota.\n\nAfter three weeks of hearings, the case is now in the hands of the jury. What’s decided could bankrupt Greenpeace’s US operations and deal a devastating blow to free speech and protest, experts say.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, revolves around protests against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation nearly a decade ago.\n\nEnergy Transfer accuses Greenpeace of masterminding the protests, spreading misinformation and causing the company financial loss through damaged property and lost revenues. It’s seeking at least $300 million and potentially more than double that in punitive damages.\n\nGreenpeace says it played only a minor role in what were Indigenous-led protests and that the lawsuit is an attempt to suppress free speech and dissent. “This is a test on our First Amendment rights during a very, very dangerous time in this country’s history,” said Deepa Padmanabha, senior legal advisor for Greenpeace USA.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s return to the White House has ushered in a wide rollback of climate and environmental policies, an emboldening of fossil fuel companies and a crackdown on free speech.\n\nSome legal experts say the case has the hallmarks of a so-called SLAPP action, a strategic lawsuit against public participation with the intent to shut down critics or trap them in expensive litigation. Dozens of US states have anti-SLAPP laws, but North Dakota does not.\n\nThe consequences of a Greenpeace loss are huge, said James Wheaton, the founder and senior counsel for the First Amendment Project, a public interest law firm. The effect could be “to establish that anybody who assists in putting on a protest is going to be held responsible for what everybody else does at that protest,” he told CNN.\n\nEnergy Transfer strongly denies its case is aimed at silencing Greenpeace. “Our lawsuit is about recovering damages for the harm Greenpeace caused our company. It is not about free speech,” said a spokesperson.\n\nGreenpeace’s “organizing, funding, and encouraging the unlawful destruction of property and the dissemination of misinformation goes well beyond the exercise of free speech. We look forward to proving our case and we trust the North Dakota legal system to do that,” they told CNN.\n\nJasilyn Charger, an activist from Cheyenne River Reservation, leads a chant during a rally demanding the Biden Administration shutdown the Dakota Access Pipeline on June 11, 2024 in Washington DC. Kevin Wolf/AP\n\nThe protests against construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline started in 2016. The Standing Rock Sioux fiercely opposed the pipeline, saying it would endanger the Missouri River, their water source, and damage sacred tribal grounds. Many thousands of people, including representatives of more than 100 tribes and dozens of non-profits, joined in the months-long protest.\n\nTheir efforts to halt construction were ultimately unsuccessful, however, and the pipeline started operating in June 2017. It now carries around 750,000 barrels of crude oil a day from North Dakota to Illinois.\n\nEnergy Transfer’s legal battle against Greenpeace has been going on for nearly eight years, driven by its CEO, the billionaire Kelcy Warren, a key Trump donor who once said at an oil industry event that pipeline protestors needed to be “removed from the gene pool.”\n\nIn an interview with CNBC in 2017, he said Standing Rock protestors had torched equipment and attempted to cut holes in pipelines. “Everybody’s afraid of these environmental groups and the fear it may look wrong if you fight back with these people, but what they did to us is wrong and they’re going to pay for it,” he said.\n\nKelcy Warren, chairman and chief executive officer of Energy Transfer Partners, during an oil industry conference in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday, March 7, 2018. Aaron M. Sprecher/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nEnergy Transfer launched its first claim against Greenpeace in 2017, alleging it had violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, legislation aimed at combating organized crime.\n\nThat lawsuit was thrown out by a North Dakota federal judge in 2019. A week later, Energy Transfer filed a similar claim in the state court against Greenpeace USA, as well as Netherlands-based Greenpeace International and Washington DC-based Greenpeace Fund.\n\nThe current lawsuit accuses Greenpeace of making defamatory statements that harmed the company’s access to financing, including claims the pipeline would damage cultural resources of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and that its contractors used excessive force against protestors.\n\nGreenpeace argues these claims had been widely reported in the media before it ever commented on them.\n\nEnergy Transfer’s claim also accuses Greenpeace of a series of other offences including nuisance and trespass.\n\nGreenpeace USA’s deputy general counsel Padmanabha said Greenpeace was at the protest to teach “non-violent direct action skills like safety and de-escalation,” she said. “We were in solidarity. This was not a Greenpeace campaign.”\n\nThe lawsuit is “trying to hold the Greenpeace entities accountable for every single thing that happened on the ground at Standing Rock,” she added.\n\nThere are also concerns that the trial location makes things very tough for Greenpeace.\n\nThe case is being tried in the heart of energy country, where three quarters of people voted for Trump, said Marty Garbus, a civil rights lawyer who has been monitoring the trial.\n\n“I don’t know of any case where as many jurors as this have direct involvement with the (oil and gas) industry,” he told CNN. “Why should they favor Greenpeace … over their neighbors (and) friends?”\n\nGreenpeace’s petition earlier to change the court venue from Morton County, an area that was heavily affected by the anti-pipeline protests, was denied earlier this month. The organization was also denied its request for the proceedings to be publicly live streamed.\n\nIn February, Greenpeace International filed its own claim against Energy Transfer in a Dutch court using the European Union’s anti-SLAPP legislation, seeking to recover the damages and costs the organization has incurred as a result of the company’s lawsuits.\n\nIn North Dakota, it’s now a waiting game. Juries are like “black boxes” and it’s impossible to guess their decision, said Wheaton of the First Amendment Project.\n\nIf Greenpeace loses, however, the impacts on protest could be chilling, he said.\n\n“Make an example of one person, especially somebody who’s big, and you’ll scare everybody else.”",

It was not immediately clear why officers were examining her phone.\n\nThe existence of the photos was outlined in a court filing Monday obtained by CNN affiliate WCVB. “In explaining why these multiple photos were deleted by her one to two days before she arrived at Logan Airport, Dr. Alawieh stated that she did not want to give authorities the perception that she supports Hezbollah and the Ayatollah politically or militarily,” the filing reads, per WCVB.\n\n“I think if you listen to one of his sermons, you would know what I mean,” Alawieh allegedly told the agents, according to WCVB’s copy of the filing. “He is a religious, spiritual person. As I said, he has very high value. His teachings are about spirituality and morality.”\n\nAlawieh, 34, acknowledged to federal agents she attended Nasrallah’s February 23 funeral – a public event attended by thousands – during her visit, said the source.\n\n“Our client is in Lebanon, and we’re not going to stop fighting to get her back in the US to see her patients, and we’re also going to make sure that the government follows the rule of law,” Stephanie Marzouk, an attorney representing Alawieh’s family in a federal complaint fighting the deportation, told reporters Monday outside a Boston courthouse.\n\nDr. Rasha Alawieh George Bayliss/BrownDailyHerald\n\nAlawieh described Nasrallah, who was killed last September by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, to the officers as a highly regarded religious leader and told them she follows his religious and spiritual techniques but not his politics, the source said.\n\nAlawieh also acknowledged to immigration officers Hezbollah is a terrorist organization, according to the source. The group, which enjoys broad support among Shia Muslims across the Middle East, is a designated terror organization in the US and many other Western countries.\n\n“Last month, Rasha Alawieh traveled to Beirut, Lebanon, to attend the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah – a brutal terrorist who led Hezbollah, responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade terror spree,” a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said.\n\nMourners gather on the day of a public funeral ceremony for late Hezbollah leaders Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine, who were killed in Israeli airstrikes last year, in Beirut on February 23. Mohammed Yassin/Reuters\n\n“A visa is a privilege not a right – glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied. This is commonsense security,” the spokesperson added.\n\nIn a separate statement, Customs and Border Protection said foreigners traveling to the US with a visa are not guaranteed entry, adding that border patrol agents have final say on who can enter the country following security checks.\n\n“Foreign nationals who promote extremist ideologies or carry terrorist propaganda are inadmissible to the US, plain and simple,” CBP spokesperson Hilton Beckham told CNN Monday.\n\nThe US Attorney’s Office for Massachusetts, which is representing the Trump administration in court, declined to comment.\n\nAlawieh’s expulsion came as Republican President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to sharply restrict border crossing and ramp up immigration arrests. It came less than a week after the detention of Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian protest organizer Mahmoud Khalil, whose attempted deportation was put on hold by a judge.\n\nOver the weekend, hundreds of immigrants with alleged gang ties were deported by the Trump administration, despite a judge’s order blocking their removal. The White House said the judge’s order came after the migrants, most from Venezuela, had left the US.\n\nCourt hearing over removal canceled today\n\nA hearing about Alawieh’s deportation was abruptly canceled Monday morning by a federal judge who had ordered immigration officials to give him notice before her removal.\n\nUS District Judge Leo Sorokin, an Obama appointee, had been monitoring the case pursuant to a complaint claiming Alawieh had not been given access to an attorney during her detainment. It was filed on Alawieh’s behalf by her cousin, Yara Chehab.\n\nIn an order filed just as Monday’s hearing was set to get underway, Sorokin said he had received testimony that “(o)fficers at Logan did not receive notice of the Court’s Order from their legal counsel until after Dr. Alawieh ‘had already departed the United States’ and that ‘[a]t no time would CBP not take a court order seriously or fail to abide by a court’s order.’”\n\nSorokin on Friday had ordered Alawieh “shall not be moved outside the District of Massachusetts without providing the Court 48 hours’ advance notice,” saying it was necessary “to give the Court time to consider the matter.”\n\nSorokin said he was delaying Monday’s hearing until later this month at the request of Chehab’s attorney after other lawyers representing her withdrew from the case “as a result of further diligence.” The attorneys who withdrew from the case did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nA Lebanese citizen who was living in Rhode Island, Alawieh was approved for an H-1B visa last year to work in the Division of Nephrology at Brown University’s medical school – after studying at three US universities since 2018 – the federal complaint states.\n\nAlawieh in February went to Lebanon for what she thought would be a short visit but was delayed in returning while trying to get paperwork from the US Consulate in Beirut, the court document says.\n\nHer paperwork was approved March 11, but when Alawieh arrived at the Boston airport two days later, she was immediately detained and told she would be sent back to Lebanon the next day, according to the complaint.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection “has refused to provide any information on the reason for her detention and expedited removal, nor to confirm the flight,” the initial complaint stated.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations believes Alawieh was “wrongly deported,” it said early Monday.\n\nRegarding claims that Alawieh attended Nasrallah’s funeral, CAIR Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell told CNN on Monday, “We have not yet seen the filing or any evidence to support this belated claim, but we would defer to her immigration attorney to comment first and foremost before we address it.”\n\n“Deporting lawful immigrants like Dr. Alawieh without any basis undermines the rule of law and reinforces suspicion that our immigration system is turning into an anti-Muslim, white supremacist institution that seeks to expel and turn away as many Muslims and people of color as possible,” CAIR said Sunday in a statement.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Gabe Amo of Rhode Island remains “committed to getting answers” from the Department of Homeland Security on Alawieh’s status, he said on X Sunday.\n\nSupporters gathered outside the Rhode Island State House in Providence Monday evening, demanding Brown University do everything in its power to allow Alawieh to return to the US. Those attending the rally also voiced concerns over the Trump administration’s recent deportation policies.\n\n“I’m worried about my travel, if I choose to go visit my family,” said Dany Khalife, a green card holder and first generation Lebanese-Palestinian living in the US with their wife and son.\n\nKhalife added that the administration’s immigration policies could be “weaponized” to target US citizens who hold citizenship in other countries.\n\nIn a statement Monday, a Brown University spokesperson said the Ivy League school would be looking into exactly what occurred.\n\n“We are seeking to learn more about what has happened, but we need to be careful about sharing information publicly about any individual’s personal circumstances,” Brown University spokesperson Brian Clark told CNN on Monday.\n\nThe university sent an email Sunday titled, “Travel guidance and resources for international community.”\n\n“Out of an abundance of caution, we encourage international students, staff, faculty and scholars – including US visa holders and permanent residents (or ‘green card holders’) – to consider postponing or delaying personal travel outside the United States until more information is available from the US Department of State,” the guidance reads.\n\nCNN’s Dakin Andone and Karina Tsui contributed to this report.",

Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\n\nCNN —\n\nFrance’s national railway operator has unveiled its next-generation high-speed trains, equipped with stylish interiors that are already causing a stir online.\n\nBranded INOUI (a play on the French word “inouï,” meaning unprecedented or incredible), these will be the fifth generation of the country’s TGV intercity service that has been at the forefront of high-speed rail travel since their launch nearly 45 years ago.\n\nAfter undergoing more than a million kilometers (over 620,000 miles) of test journeys, the new trains — manufactured entirely in France — were unveiled earlier this month by SNCF Voyageurs, the French national passenger rail operator, and manufacturer Alstom.\n\n“45 years after the first TGV, we’re going to revolutionize high-speed travel once again,” Christophe Fanichet, CEO of SNCF Voyageurs, said in a press statement.\n\n“70s space age vibes”\n\nThe trains, which will travel at speeds of up to 320 kilometers an hour (nearly 200 mph) caused a stir online, with social media users praising the new designs. as “incredible.”\n\n“There’s just something about these 70s space age vibes that make it feel modern and retro at the same time,” Jan Buis, who posts about technology and design, wrote on X.\n\nThe first- and second-class carriages feature light interiors, complemented by statement yellow lamps. Table lamps have long been a staple on TGVs and the new generation are meant to look “as round as the seats” while adding a touch of “bright colour” and humor, according to SNCF’s statement.\n\nThe overall look of the project is the result of a collaboration between French engineering consultancy AREP and Japanese design agency NENDO.\n\nSNCF says comfort was the central theme throughout the design process.

Yann Audic\n\nA new car has been designed for wheelchair users making it possible for them to board independently. Yann Audic\n\nComfort is the central theme, AREP said in a press release.\n\n“The idea was to take a fresh look, to introduce a lasting break in the railway world and to re-enchant a technical and industrial environment,” it said, adding that the interiors are intended to provide a “more personal bubble of comfort in a shared space.”\n\nFrance’s famed cuisine and quality local ingredients will be showcased on the train’s “centrepiece” — a dining car spanning two floors. Passengers will be able to buy self-service items in the downstairs area, while the upstairs will be home to a “convivial bistro” featuring seasonal French dishes and wines.\n\nThe bistro carriage on the new TGV INOUI train spans two floors, with seasonal French cuisine on the menu.

Conductors, drivers and maintenance workers advised on designing layouts better suited to their daily tasks. The drivers used virtual reality technology to experience and choose between three different cab environments.\n\nThoughtful design extends beyond the needs of those working on the train. Microwaves, extra changing tables and relaxation areas have been added to help families travelling with children. A new car has also been designed for wheelchair users, making it possible for them to board the train independently and order food to their seats.\n\nJourneys will start on the Paris-Lyon-Marseille line in 2026, taking travelers from the capital to the south coast in three hours.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been a concern since Moscow’s forces stormed the facility in March 2022.\n\nThe UN’s nuclear watchdog has repeatedly warned about the security dangers facing the plant – the largest nuclear power station in Europe – which sits on the front line of Russia’s invasion.\n\nNow, the Zaporizhzhia plant is expected to be part of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, Trump administration officials said this week.\n\nThe White House press secretary on Monday falsely asserted that the occupied nuclear power plant is “on the border,” given that its location in the city of Enerhodar, Zaporizhzhia, is almost 200 miles from Ukraine’s internationally recognized border.\n\nBefore Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant supplied roughly 20% of Ukraine’s energy, with six reactors.\n\nBut the plant is now disconnected from the grid and has suffered some damage amid drone strikes and constant shelling. All six reactors are now in shutdown and there are concerns over the plant’s ongoing maintenance, as explosions continue to hit nearby, according to the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team on the ground.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of endangering the nuclear facility and surrounding population, while Moscow has accused Ukraine of instigating attacks on the plant. Ukraine has also previously raised concerns that Russia could try to connect the plant to its own power grid.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Kyiv last Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the plant “is a problem for the Russians.”\n\n“Its existence is impossible without Ukraine. We need money and specialists to restore it. And time too, it will take several years,” Zelensky said. “This is also a problem for us because it is our plant. Lost money, lost opportunities.”\n\n“I am sure that they (Russia) will make political, public statements that the station will soon be operational and will supply electricity to the territories controlled by the Russians. It will not happen quickly,” Zelensky added. “And the (UN nuclear watchdog) IAEA will be under constant political pressure because the IAEA cannot allow them to do this.”\n\nTrump said on Sunday that negotiators had already pinpointed certain topics up for discussion in his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, including “dividing up certain assets” and saying: “We will be talking about land, we’ll be talking about power plants.”\n\nAsked about Trump’s comment on power plants, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday: “There’s a power plant that is on the border of Russia and Ukraine that was up for discussion with the Ukrainians, and he will address it in his call with Putin,” specifying that she was talking about the nuclear plant.\n\n“I won’t get ahead of those negotiations, but I can say we are on the 10th yard line of peace, and we’ve never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment, and the president, as you know, is determined to get one done,” Leavitt also said.\n\nZaporizhzhia is one of the four regions illegally annexed by Russia in 2022. The Kremlin annexed the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia following so-called referendums in the regions that were dismissed as “shams” by Ukraine and Western nations. Russia had previously annexed Crimea in 2014.\n\nPutin has continued to make maximalist demands to control all of those regions, even though Ukraine still holds significant amounts of territory in Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThe Kremlin said last month that the four occupied and annexed regions are “an integral part of Russia” and “non-negotiable.”\n\nCNN’s Victoria Butenko and Anna Chernova contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Trump is blaming Biden for the weakening economy. Is that fair?",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nMarkets are on the fritz and investor sentiment has slumped into “extreme fear” territory. Consumer confidence readings have cratered and surveys show a sharp turnabout in Americans’ feelings about their future financial well-being. Any positive reports are described by economists as the “calm before the storm.”\n\nThe common denominator is pure and utter uncertainty — particularly about just how President Donald Trump’s sweeping policy actions could shake out, economists say.\n\nHowever, when the topics of the economy, volatile markets, shaken confidence and sudden recession fears have been broached with Trump, he’s hammered on familiar notes: That the Biden administration left him with an economic situation that was “catastrophic,” a “nightmare,” “horrible,” or “damaged.”\n\nStill, data aside, the economy didn’t feel great to all Americans who suffered through the highest inflation in decades, and those sour feelings helped send Trump back to the White House for a second term.\n\nSuch claims have become a hair-pull for economists, statisticians, academics and fact-checkers alike: By most gold-standard measures, President Joe Biden handed Trump a booming economy. And, if anything, the economy was ripe for a resurgence in early 2025 under Trump, economists have told CNN.\n\nConsumer confidence readings have declined sharply in recent weeks on fears that President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could drive prices higher. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The economy was bad under Biden and that was reflected in the polls last year; but inflation and every other economic indicator had more or less stabilized when President Trump took office,” Jai Kedia, an economist and research fellow at the Cato Institute, told CNN in an interview.\n\nWhat’s happening now, Kedia said, is a tale as old as politics: The blame game.\n\nKedia, who’s a Libertarian, is in the camp of politicians should “leave things alone,” when it comes to the economy.\n\n“This is true in the Biden administration with the massive spending bills and all of that, which in some part led to inflation; and that’s true now with the tariffs that we’re seeing,” Kedia said. “It’s really hard to figure out why you would blame the previous administration. The stock market actually went up once Trump was elected, and it’s only in the past month when the administration is playing around with dangerous economic ideas that you see the economy started to swivel back.”\n\n“That’s a direct result of the tariffs and other economic proposals,” he said.\n\nThere are plenty of caveats when it comes to economic data: One month does not make a trend; figures are preliminary and often subject to revision as more detailed information becomes available; reports often represent a snapshot in time and can be influenced by one-off events such as weather; and, above all else, it takes time for situations to evolve and be fully understood.\n\n“This is a problem across our political spectrum of cherry-picking one month of employment or inflation reports to make general conclusions about the trend,” Kedia said.\n\nTake, for example, Biden taking credit for “creating” nearly 16 million jobs during his time in office; and then, most recently, Trump touting a slice of the February jobs report: a 10,000-job boost in manufacturing that he credited to his tariff-heavy trade policy and desires to make America a factory superpower.\n\nBoth claims have truthful elements to them, but there are important distinctions to be made: For Biden, he needed to clarify that it took roughly 9.5 million jobs of those to get back to pre-pandemic levels of employment; and for Trump, those gains are preliminary estimates and very well could be reflective of investments put forth under the Biden administration.\n\n“It’s way too early to understand what the effects of the tariffs are on manufacturing and the rest of the economy,” Kedia said. “The markets clearly are telling you where they think this is going.”\n\nThis and other alarm bells are heightening recession fears.\n\nOn-again, off-again tariffs, mass government layoffs, funding cuts and other sweeping policy moves from the Trump administration have spooked investors. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“This is not large enough to be a recessionary shock at this point; but it’s going to cause growth to slow,” Joe Brusuelas, RSM US principal and chief economist, said in an interview.\n\nBrusuelas’ firm recently lifted its recession probability to 20% from 15%, or a one in five chance. If the current uncertainty evolves into a large trade shock that’s sustained, RSM would revisit those projections, Brusuelas said.\n\n“If the shock is caused by a specific trade policy, it’s highly likely that credit or blame — depending on your point of view regarding the recession — would fall squarely in the laps of the Trump administration,” he said. “That doesn’t mean the administration won’t say it’s Biden’s fault. They’ve already laid the predicate on that.”\n\nTo be fair, confidence surveys aren’t always reliable indicators of future economic performance, said Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University and chief economist at SS Economics.\n\n“There’s an unprecedented amount of uncertainty, what I call a very thick fog, and we can’t tell whether we’re going north or south right now,” he said. “Once the fog clears up, the confidence will go up. So I would not use business confidence or consumer confidence as an indicator of how well or how poorly the economy is going to do going forward.”",

We’re already talking about that — dividing up certain assets.”\n\nTrump’s comments come after he announced last week that Ukraine had accepted a US-proposed 30-day ceasefire, putting the ball in Russia’s court as to whether it would accept his proposal to swiftly end the war.\n\nPutin’s response so far to the Trump-backed ceasefire proposal has been ambiguous. He said that Moscow agreed with the proposal in theory. But he also set out tough conditions and demanded concessions from Kyiv, and repeated his claim that the current Ukrainian government was part of the “root cause” of the war.\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister said Tuesday that Moscow should “unconditionally agree” to the US proposal — making it clear that Kyiv does not want to make further concessions.\n\nCNN’s Svitlana Vlasova in Kyiv and Lauren Kent in London contributed reporting.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe most chilling aspect of a new White House claim of boundless executive power is not whether officials ignored a judge’s order to halt deportations of Venezuelan alleged gang members.\n\nIt’s that some senior Trump administration aides seem not to care if they did. There are even claims that some judges are simply too junior to question the actions of a president.\n\nThe furor caused by the administration’s peacetime use of wartime powers under the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act is the latest, and perhaps most overt, sign of President Donald Trump’s sense of omnipotence. He’s also betting voters will reward him for, in his view, keeping them safe with ruthless immigration enforcement rather than recoil from his challenges to the Constitution.\n\nThe growing showdown is so critical because the courts are one of the final checks on Trump’s power after he crushed opposition in the Republican Party and helped shut the Democratic Party out of any power in any branch of government in Washington.\n\nThe administration’s transformational willingness to test bedrock constitutional principles was laid bare in a stunning interview of senior White House adviser Stephen Miller with CNN’s Kasie Hunt on Monday.\n\nMiller argued that since Trump was flexing his powers as commander in chief, the courts had no right to hold him to account, defying one of the tenets of American democracy upheld through the three branches of government. He said the Alien Enemies Act, which has a dubious historical legacy, was “written explicitly to give the president the authority to repel an alien invasion of the United States.” Miller added: “That is not something that a district court judge has any authority whatsoever to interfere with, to enjoin, to restrict, or to restrain in any way.”\n\nPutting aside the White House claim that the United States is subject to an invasion by Venezuelan gang members – which rests on questionable legal ground – a senior aide to the president is essentially arguing his boss has absolute power.\n\n“You can read the law yourself,” Miller said. “There’s not one clause in that law that makes it subject to judicial review, let alone district court review.”\n\nThe President escalated his assault on the independent judiciary Tuesday, calling for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg over his temporary halt to the deportations of alleged gang members. He called the judge “a troublemaker and agitator” on Truth Social and implied that his victory in the popular vote and all seven swing states in last year’s election granted him greater power to judge the legality of his own actions than a federal judge – in a misreading of Supreme Court precedent.\n\n‘I don’t care’\n\nMiller’s certitude was mirrored Monday by Trump’s border czar Tom Homan, who expressed contempt for the notion that Trump’s border crackdown could be constrained. “We’re not stopping. I don’t care what the judges think. I don’t care what the left thinks. We’re coming,” Homan told Lawrence Jones of Fox News.\n\nThe idea that the White House would ignore what judges say threatens the most basic building blocks of constitutional government that every American kid learns in civics class.\n\nThe administration’s mindset infuriated the judge in the deportations case, who is investigating whether the White House ignored his orders Saturday to halt the deportations of expelled alleged gang members and return flights carrying them to the US.\n\nThis handout image obtained Sunday from El Salvador’s Presidency Press Office, shows Salvadoran police officers escorting alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua recently deported by the US government to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) prison. El Salvador’s Presidency Press Office/Handout/Reuters\n\nThe administration is arguing, among other things, that it didn’t violate Boasberg’s order from the weekend since his oral order from the bench said the government must turn around planes carrying individuals subject to Trump’s proclamation around, but his written order did not.\n\nAn exasperated Boasberg summarized the DOJ’s reasoning as: “‘We don’t care, we’ll do what we want.’”\n\nBoasberg gave the DOJ’s lawyers until Tuesday to come up with data about the timing of the deportation flights that they refused to provide on Monday.\n\n“This is a showdown. This is akin to inter-branch March Madness,” former Federal Judge John E. Jones III told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.\n\nConstitutional experts said Miller’s argument clashed with the landmark Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison, which established the high court’s authority by finding among other key principles that the actions of the executive branch are subject to judicial review.\n\n“The whole point of Marbury v. Madison … is that you go first to the district court for federal questions and questions of constitutional law, so he’s not understanding that,” said Corey Brettschneider, a Brown University professor and host of the podcast “The Oath and the Office.” “If you think that the Supreme Court can ultimately opine, then you think the district court can opine on these matters.”\n\nCNN legal analyst Elliot Williams also narrowed in on Marbury v. Madison. “The Supreme Court rules in 1803 that (it) has the authority to review the actions of the executive and legislative branches of government. … The president’s actions can be reviewed by a court – that is basic American history.”\n\nWilliams went on: “The idea that somehow there’s a class of actions that cannot be reviewed is nonsense. Everybody who lived through the 2000s knows that the war on terror was litigated in the courts over and over.”\n\nTrump believes there are few limits on his power\n\nTrump has long advanced the belief that the presidency confers ultimate power, even though this conflicts with the principles of a nation built on revulsion of rule by an absolute monarch. “I have an Article II, where I have to the right to do whatever I want as president,” he said in July 2019, during his first term. Article II of the Constitution lays out the duties of the presidency – but it does not confer unfettered executive authority.\n\nPeople don’t normally reach the heights of the West Wing without understanding the basics of history and American jurisprudence. So the comments by Miller and Homan seem to hint at a second-term corps of officials keen to fulfill Trump’s dreams of kingly might.\n\n“Where it gets scary and this is what was so frightening about the interview is when he starts saying ‘I don’t care what the courts say – we have the right to do it anyway’ and he wouldn’t even commit to following even a Supreme Court order’ – that’s why we are so obviously in a constitutional crisis,” Brettschneider said.\n\nA political crisis is also gathering\n\nThe battle over the deportations to a notorious prison in El Salvador is only the latest sign that the administration plans to claim almost limitless presidential power on issue after issue two months into Trump’s jarring second term.\n\nTrump is betting that his Republican allies will do nothing to rein him in, that his Democratic foes are too weak to slow him and that procedural traditions in the courts can only rule on his disruption in retrospect.\n\n“We are unafraid to double down, and to take responsibility and ownership of the serious decisions that are being made,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday. “The president was elected with an overwhelming mandate to launch the largest mass deportation campaign in American history, and that’s exactly what he is doing.”\n\nConstitutional and legal fights can often feel remote to the more pressing daily concerns of citizens outside Washington – as Democrats found to their cost last year when they based at least part of their election campaign on the need to defend institutions that many Americans feel are not responding to their needs.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a news conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on Monday. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBut the outcome of the migrant flights drama – and challenges to other far-reaching administration initiatives, such as the attempt to overturn birthright citizenship and Elon Musk’s evisceration of the federal government – will be critical to deciding how America will be led and what kind of country it will be for the next four years and possibly for years afterwards.\n\nIn a White House dominated by an all-powerful commander in chief, officials harbor a conception of the Constitution that most Americans would not recognize.\n\nWhen Hunt raised the separation of powers in relation to the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants – apparently without due process – Miller replied: “Yes, separation of powers. This is the judiciary interfering in the executive function.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was adamant: The US is not headed toward recession.\n\n“Donald Trump is bringing growth to America. I would never bet on recession. No chance,” Lutnick said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” one of dozens of TV appearances he’s made in touting the Trump administration’s tariff agenda.\n\nMeanwhile on Fox News, President Donald Trump was much more circumspect about the prospect of recession.\n\n“I hate to predict things like that,” Trump said in striking a starkly different tone than his Commerce secretary. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing. And there are always periods of – it takes a little time.”\n\nAs the White House has kicked off its trade war in fits and starts, issuing a litany of haphazard tariffs on a range of imports, Lutnick has assumed the role of cheerleader in chief – someone to soothe the markets and promote the supposed benefits of trade policies that will likely make life more expensive for millions of Americans.\n\nIt has not gone well.\n\nThe stock market has plummeted, with the S&P 500 falling last week by 10% from its peak just a month ago. Consumer sentiment has turned negative. Business leaders around the world are now preparing for a widespread pull back in investment and earnings.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen executives and current and former administration officials suggest frustration is rising with Lutnick’s public stances, as doubts emerge about whether he is equipped for such a high-profile role amidst a growing geopolitical maelstrom.\n\nComplicating matters, Lutnick’s own views on trade are more nuanced than his salesmanship would suggest. Privately, he’s told friends he’s “not thrilled” with Trump’s impulsive approach to repeatedly ratchet up tariffs instead of leveraging them for future concessions.\n\nIn his near-constant presence on cable television, Lutnick, the long-time CEO of a Wall Street trading firm who’s donated millions of his own money to Trump over the years, finds himself in the unenviable position of trying to stabilize a situation that is by design meant to destabilize.\n\n“He’s got a bit of a curse,” said one Wall Street executive. “He’s got to be the guy out there advocating for Trump, even if he doesn’t own the policy design.”\n\nTrump reiterated on Sunday he won’t pull back on tariffs, telling reporters on Air Force one there would be “no exemptions” for steel and aluminum tariffs and that his proposed reciprocal tariffs would take effect on April 2.\n\nIn his brusque New York fashion, Lutnick rose from a relatively obscure Wall Street trading firm to the highest echelons of the Republican Party by outmuscling and outspending longtime Trump loyalists. His aggressive approach cost him the job he wanted most in the administration, Treasury secretary, but it also helped seal his fate as the de facto face of Trump’s trade war.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CNN: “Every member of the Trump administration is playing from the same playbook — President Trump’s playbook — to enact an America First agenda of tariffs, tax cuts, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy.\n\n“Secretary Lutnick and the rest of the administration remain aligned on delivering economic prosperity for the American people, an effort that is already bringing results – including the February jobs report showing a dramatic reversal of hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs during the Biden administration and trillions in investment commitments from industry titans ranging from TSMC to Apple,” Desai said.\n\n‘Knives out’\n\nAfter Trump’s victory in 2024, Lutnick became a central figure in deciding the makeup of the new Cabinet as co-chair of the Trump transition.\n\nHe had a job in mind for himself: Treasury secretary.\n\nLutnick was up against Scott Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager and MAGA convert who was seen as closer to Wall Street and was not as supportive of sweeping tariffs as Lutnick.\n\nWith Trump close to picking Bessent, Lutnick embarked on an aggressive 11th-hour campaign to pitch himself for the job, CNN previously reported. He maneuvered behind the scenes to try to convince Trump that he was the only candidate who would fully support his tariff plans. Even Elon Musk weighed in on X to publicly back Lutnick over Bessent.\n\nTransition aides began comparing Lutnick to Dick Cheney, who was tasked to lead the search for George W. Bush’s 2000 vice-presidential candidate before selecting himself.\n\nLutnick settled for the Commerce job – and oversight of the Office of the US Trade Representative – as a consolation prize.\n\nWithin the administration, there are still “knives out” between Lutnick and Bessent, said one senior advisor. During the confirmation hearings, White House staff felt they needed to choose sides of who they would help prepare, Bessent or Lutnick, according to people familiar with the dynamic.\n\nUS Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, left, and Howard Lutnick, right, stand behind President Donald Trump as he speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on February 3, in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nWithin Trump’s immediate orbit, Lutnick’s posture places him as a sort of middle-man between Peter Navarro, a tariff true-believer, and Bessent, who’s more pro-growth .\n\nFormer Trump officials say the administration sorely misses Robert Lighthizer, the architect of Trump’s first-term trade agenda, as a key internal voice amid the market turmoil.\n\n“He was a moderating influence on Peter Navarro,” one senior Trump adviser said of Lighthizer. “And he was much more attuned to how [the president’s] positions played politically.”\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Navarro said: “I’m working with the finest trade policy team ever assembled to implement President Trump’s vision for reciprocal trade – a vision in which American workers are never cheated again.”\n\n﻿“We are a diverse group with complementary skill sets and a high level of trust … who debate behind closed doors and emerge as ‘one band, one sound,’ all orchestrated by the most visionary commander in chief in modern presidential history,” Navarro said.\n\nMeanwhile, Lighthizer, who had been in contention for the top job at Commerce, has been watching the trade drama unfold from the speaking circuit and his home in Palm Beach, Florida, according to people close to him. Lighthizer turned down an offer to return to his perch at USTR or serve as a trade czar, but these people suggest he could join the administration if there’s turnover in the Cabinet.\n\nElsewhere in the Cabinet, Lutnick’s brusqueness has been welcomed. In trade negotiations with Canadian provinces, Lutnick at times has worked alongside Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. Burgum’s gubernatorial bona fides have complemented Lutnick’s New York brashness to create a “good cop, bad cop” dynamic, according to Kevin O’Leary, a Canadian businessman close to the administration.\n\n“He’s a really good bad cop,” O’Leary told CNN of Lutnick.\n\nTariff cheerleader in chief\n\nLutnick’s heavy rotation on TV has echoes of Larry Kudlow, a longtime business-news anchor who fiercely defended Trump’s first-term agenda while serving as his director of the National Economic Council.\n\nThe key difference, insiders note, is that Kudlow’s appearances often had the intended effect of stabilizing markets.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick does a television interview on the North Lawn of the White House on March 14, in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\nSome Trump loyalists worry that Lutnick plays fast and loose with the facts, creating a track record of misstatements. In October, Lutnick told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that Musk would not work in the administration but would “write software” for the government. And Lutnick categorically denied Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy would be named to that role two weeks later.\n\nLutnick has also gotten ahead of the president, declaring last week that Trump intended to eliminate taxes for anyone making less than $150,000. And leaked news of a Lutnick-led plan to privatize the US Postal Service resulted in a White House scramble – and threat of legal challenges – well before the plan was ready for release.\n\nLutnick’s status as a green room denizen has irked corporate America, too. Two executives of Fortune 50 companies told CNN they’ve been able to get meetings with senior members of Trump’s staff like deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller – but not with Lutnick.\n\n“He’s too busy being on f**king television,” said one of the executives, who was granted anonymity to describe private interactions with the administration.\n\nA White House official pushed back on that criticism, saying that Lutnick has been in regular contact with CEOs and executives in the business community, particularly as trade discussions have heated up with Canada and Mexico.\n\nWho is Howard Lutnick?\n\nLutnick made his fortune in the bare-knuckled world of stock and bond trading at Cantor Fitzgerald, a brokerage firm observers liken to fictional trading floors in “The Bonfire of the Vanities,” or real-life depictions in “Liar’s Poker” or “The Wolf of Wall Street.”\n\nJoining the firm in 1983 as a trainee, Lutnick earned the affection of firm co-founder B. Gerald Cantor and rose through the ranks. By 1991, Lutnick became CEO at the age of 29.\n\nOn September 11, 2001, the firm, whose offices were in the North Tower of the World Trade Center, lost 70% of its 960 employees.\n\nLutnick was spared by a stroke of luck: He’d arrive late after dropping off his 5-year-old son to his first day of kindergarten. Lutnick’s brother Gary was among the victims.\n\nLutnick is seen on the trading floor of Cantor Fitzgerald's headquarters in September 2002, one year after almost three of every four Cantor employees died during the September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center. Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times/Redux\n\nAs Cantor Fitzgerald grew – and he took public or sold off parts of its businesses – Lutnick’s wealth grew, too. He began snapping up real estate in Manhattan and the Hamptons and devoting a considerable share of his personal wealth to political causes.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential race, Lutnick donated to the campaigns of both Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, according to campaign finance records. But he was known as a friend of Trump, and after Trump’s 2016 victory he was asked in an interview with CNN’s Richard Quest if he wanted to serve in the new Trump administration.\n\n“You know what? I’ve known him a long time. And I’m rooting for him and hoping great things happen to America,” Lutnick responded.\n\nMonths later, he donated $1 million to Trump’s 2017 inauguration. In 2019, Lutnick hosted a fundraiser at his Manhattan apartment that Trump attended ahead of his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nDuring the latest presidential campaign, Lutnick gave Trump’s PAC $5 million of his personal money and raised $15 million in August 2024 during a fundraiser he hosted for Trump at his home in the Hamptons.\n\nSeven days later, Trump announced that Lutnick would co-chair his transition team.\n\nUsing America’s ‘upper hand’\n\nSeven weeks into the new administration, Lutnick is searching for his ideological groove behind the scenes. Traditionally, the Commerce post is focused squarely on increasing exports for US businesses overseas; Lutnick, by contrast, has found himself promoting policies that could hamper trade with the US.\n\nLutnick is neither a tariff zealot nor a free trader, friends and advisors say. Instead, they cast him as more of a realist who views tariffs as a tool to achieve certain objectives and challenge the status quo.\n\n“He believes: ‘If we have the power and upper hand and full strength of the US economy, why are we not using it?’” said an executive who has discussed the topic with him.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here’s what Americans living 15 miles from the Canadian border think of tariffs 03:30 - Source: CNN Here’s what Americans living 15 miles from the Canadian border think of tariffs 03:30\n\nBut Trump’s new tariffs have been hardly empty threats. In a matter of weeks, he has opened up at least three new fronts in a tit-for-tat trade war. Trump has threatened 25% tariffs on Europe in response to the bloc’s taxation of US tech companies. He’s increased tariffs on Chinese imports by 20 percentage points. And he placed new levies on imports from Canada and Mexico, despite weeks of backchanneling with officials from both countries on immigration and fentanyl efforts.\n\nWhile Lutnick has cheered on Trump’s tariffs, even he has privately worried that Trump’s bombast has challenged the administration’s ability to secure a stronger trade pact with Canada and Mexico when the deal must be agreed to again by July 2026, according to a senior Trump adviser.\n\n“He’d much prefer to do this as part of negotiations for USMCA,” the senior adviser said of the NAFTA replacement negotiated in 2018. “He’s afraid [Trump] has jumped the shark.”\n\nLutnick was among the advisors surprised by Trump’s response in early March to a retaliatory threat from Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, with a pledge to double tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum to 50%.\n\nBoth moves sent stocks sharply lower, spurring Lutnick into action. The two spoke by phone on March 11, leading Ford to back down from his plan to place a 25% charge on electric power Canada was sending to the northeast US. In return, Trump dropped his threat, a temporary retreat for the self-professed “tariff man.”\n\n‘A work in progress’\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Lutnick is not yet a well-known quantity for many Republican senators. Several noted that Lutnick and Trump are close and said that his pro-tariff message is carrying out Trump’s desired policy, even as they expressed concerns about the impacts tariffs will have on inflation and the economy.\n\nSecretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick walks outside the West Wing of the White House, in Washington, DC, on March 12. Doug Mills/The New York Times/Redux\n\n“The Cabinet works and responds to the needs and the demands and the requests of the president of the United States, and the two of them have a very close, personal and professional, long-standing relationship,” said Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso of Wyoming.\n\nAsked if Lutnick was responsive to any needs or concerns coming from Capitol Hill, Barrasso pulled out his cell phone, showing that he had spoken to Lutnick just a day prior.\n\nDemocrats have their doubts. Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, told CNN that Lutnick has been advocating for a policy that cuts directly against his department’s goal of advocating for the business community.\n\n“I think he has become the president’s cheerleader for an idea that that has very little substance behind how that plan would work or how you’d be successful – and doesn’t have a lot of historic results to show that it could be successful,” Cantwell said.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said more time was needed to assess how Trump’s trade trajectory – and Lutnick’s role in it – will play out.\n\nCornyn said of Lutnick’s staunch defense of Trump’s tariffs: “Well, that’s his job.”\n\n“This is a work in progress,” he said. “We don’t know how that story will end.”\n\nCNN’s Alayna Treene and Lauren Fox contributed to this report",

        "content": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nNASA’s Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore — who gained international attention as their planned short stay in space stretched into a nine-month, politically fraught mission — are finally heading home.\n\nThe astronauts climbed aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule alongside two teammates, NASA’s Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov of Russia’s Roscosmos space agency, and departed the International Space Station at 1:05 a.m. ET Tuesday before an expected splashdown return Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWilliams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov are part of the Crew-9 mission, a routine staff rotation jointly operated by NASA and SpaceX. The Crew-9 capsule launched to the space station in September with Hague and Gorbunov riding alongside two empty seats reserved for Williams and Wilmore, who have been on the orbiting laboratory since last June, when their original ride — a Boeing Starliner spacecraft — malfunctioned.\n\nSafely reaching Earth will conclude a trip that, for Williams and Wilmore, has garnered broad interest because of the unexpected nature of their extended stay in orbit and the dramatic turn of events that prevented them from returning home aboard the Boeing Starliner vehicle.\n\nBut the length of the duo’s stay in space is not record-breaking. Williams and Wilmore’s extended mission is expected to conclude after 286 days, which is still significantly shorter than the world record of 437 days in orbit held by the late Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov.\n\nWilliams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov are on track to spend Tuesday morning and afternoon in orbit in the roughly 13-foot-wide (4-meter-wide), gumdrop-shaped SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Gradually descending, the capsule will carry the astronauts from the space station, which orbits about 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, toward the thick inner layer of our planet’s atmosphere.\n\nNASA's SpaceX Crew-9 mission, carrying US astronauts Nick Hague, Butch Wilmore, and Suni Williams and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, undocks Tuesday following their monthslong mission aboard the International Space Station. NASA\n\nAround 5 p.m. ET, the Crew Dragon capsule is expected to fire its engines to begin the final phase of the journey: reentry. This leg of the journey is considered the most dangerous of any flight home from space. The jarring physics of hitting the atmosphere while traveling more than 22 times the speed of sound routinely heats the exterior of returning spacecraft to more than 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,926 degrees Celsius) and can trigger a communication blackout.\n\nAfter plunging toward home, the Crew Dragon spacecraft will then deploy two sets of parachutes in quick succession to further slow its descent. If all goes to plan, the capsule will decelerate from orbital speeds of more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kilometers per hour) to less than 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) as the vehicle hits the ocean.\n\nWilliams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov are slated to splash down off the coast of Florida as soon as 5:57 p.m. ET Tuesday — though the exact time and location are subject to change as mission controllers keep tabs on weather and the progress of the crew’s return trip.\n\nAfter the vehicle hits the ocean, a SpaceX rescue ship waiting nearby will haul the spacecraft out of the water, and Williams and Wilmore will exit Dragon and take their first breaths of earthly air in nine months.\n\nLast summer, NASA decided flying the two astronauts home aboard their Boeing Starliner capsule would be too risky, and the space agency opted to fold Williams and Wilmore into the International Space Station’s regular crew rotation. That call is why the pair are flying home with Hague and Gorbunov on SpaceX’s Crew-9 capsule.\n\nMedical teams will evaluate the crew’s health, as is routine after astronauts return from space, before deciding next steps. Ultimately, the NASA crew members will return to their home base at Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nA political drama unfurls\n\nThe Crew-9 team is returning home this week because NASA and SpaceX successfully launched the Crew-10 mission to orbit on Friday.\n\nThe four Crew-10 astronauts — who will take over operations on board the orbiting laboratory — docked with the space station just after midnight ET on Sunday.\n\nNASA has maintained since last summer, when it announced Williams and Wilmore would join the Crew-9 team, that Crew-10 needed to be in place before the Starliner astronauts could leave orbit. That planning allowed NASA to keep the US-controlled portion of the space station fully staffed without needing to fly a separate, multimillion-dollar return mission for Williams and Wilmore. The United States jointly operates the space station with Russia, Japan, Canada and the participating countries of the European Space Agency.\n\nThe decision, however, has been the subject of apparent criticism from SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, who have claimed Williams and Wilmore were abandoned by the Biden administration.\n\nIn posts about the matter on X, Musk has said SpaceX could have brought Williams and Wilmore home months ago, but an offer was denied for “political reasons.”\n\nIt’s not clear what that offer entailed or to whom it was offered.\n\nA Biden-era senior NASA official told CNN that SpaceX never communicated such an offer to agency leadership — and the space agency likely would not have entertained the idea regardless.\n\nIf Musk had made the offer to someone outside NASA leadership, the source noted, “I’m sure they would have responded and said, ‘Well, that would cost us several $100 million extra that we don’t have for a new Dragon capsule and Falcon 9.’”\n\nMusk has since said the offer was not made to NASA but was taken directly to the Biden White House, which “refused to allow it,” according to a post he shared on X.\n\nIt’s unclear why such a deal would have been discussed with the White House, which does not typically have any involvement in NASA crew assignments or space station staffing matters.\n\nA former White House staffer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen asked about the matter during a news conference March 4, Wilmore said he was not familiar with what offer may have been made, but said of Musk’s statements, “I believe him.”\n\nWhen asked about the matter Friday, Sarah Walker, SpaceX’s director of Dragon mission management, also said she was not involved in the conversations referenced in Musk’s social media posts.\n\n“What I do know from almost 15 years of working with this exact team, with commercial crew and ISS, is that NASA is always looking at multiple options — every option available for any operation that they may go do — and then many contingency options for when the unexpected inevitably happens,” Walker said.\n\nA history of extended stays in space\n\nWilliams and Wilmore’s mission has been the subject of nearly constant speculation and scrutiny.\n\nThe astronauts have repeatedly sought to quash narratives that they were “abandoned,” “stuck” or “stranded.”\n\n“That’s been the narrative from day one: stranded, abandoned, stuck — and I get it, we both get it,” Wilmore told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in February. “Help us change the narrative, let’s change it to: prepared and committed despite what you’ve been hearing. That’s what we prefer.”\n\nWilliams has also faced a torrent of tabloid speculation about her appearance — despite NASA’s repeated statements that she was healthy and had not lost weight.\n\nBut despite the outsize interest in Williams and Wilmore’s mission, a number of astronauts have had their stays in space extended without warning.\n\nAmerican astronaut Frank Rubio is helped out of the Soyuz MS-23 spacecraft minutes after he and two Roscosmos cosmonauts landed near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, on September 27, 2023. NASA/Getty Images\n\nNotably, NASA astronaut Frank Rubio had been slated for a six-month mission at the International Space Station after he arrived aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in September 2022. He instead logged a total of 371 days in space following the discovery that his spacecraft sprang a coolant leak. The Russian space agency launched a replacement Soyuz spacecraft for Rubio and his cosmonaut crewmates several months later.\n\nUpon his return to Earth in September 2023, Rubio’s stay set a new record for the longest an American astronaut has ever spent in microgravity. He also became the first American to log an entire calendar year in orbit.\n\nDina Contella, NASA’s deputy manager of the International Space Station program, sought to put Williams and Wilmore’s extended stay in perspective with other missions during a news conference on Friday.\n\n“There have been many crew members who’ve been on orbit longer than (Williams and Wilmore’s stay), and so we don’t see any need for any special precautions” after splashdown, Contella said. “Like any astronauts coming back, there’s an acclimation period and so that’ll vary by crew member.”\n\nAstronauts returning from long-duration stays in space routinely exit their spacecraft on stretchers as their bodies need time to adjust to feeling Earth’s gravity. Williams and Wilmore have extensive prior spaceflight experience, so they know to expect to spend a couple months readapting.\n\nIf NASA identifies any pressing medical concerns, the space agency can ferry the Crew-9 team members to a nearby hospital in Florida after splashdown, as was the case after the Crew-8 team returned from a nearly eight-month stay in space.\n\nAll four astronauts on board that mission later reported they were healthy, if still readjusting, after spending months in weightlessness.\n\n“The weight and the heaviness of things just is surprising,” Crew-8 astronaut Janette Epps said of her experience returning to Earth last year. “(I’ve been) laying any chance I got. But you have to move, and you have to exercise every day, otherwise you don’t get those gains. You have to move regardless of how exhausted you feel.”\n\nHow Williams and Wilmore spent their days\n\nDespite the unexpectedly long stay, Williams and Wilmore have characterized their extra time in space as a bonus that they were well-prepared for, thanks to their deep experience as veteran astronauts.\n\n“This is my happy place,” Williams said in September. “I love being up here in space. It’s just fun. You know, every day you do something that’s work … (but) you can do it sideways, so it adds a little different perspective.\n\n“Eventually we want to go home,” she added, “because we left our families a little while ago, but we have a lot to do while we’re up here.”\n\nBefore taking off aboard the Boeing Starliner capsule for its first crewed test flight last June, Williams and Wilmore were fully trained to join the space station staff — so they were ready for the scenario that ultimately unfolded as they embarked upon their mission.\n\nSuni Williams is seen during a six-hour spacewalk outside the International Space Station. A SpaceX Dragon crew spacecraft (top right) can be seen docked to the space station's Harmony module. NASA\n\nThe duo has engaged in routine daily tasks ever since. Williams even took over as space station commander, and both astronauts conducted spacewalks to carry out ISS maintenance.\n\nDuring a March 4 news conference from space, Williams said she will miss “everything” about being in space.\n\n“This has been Butch and my third flight to the International Space Station,” she said. “I think just the fact that we’re living up here in this very unique place gives you an amazing perspective — not only (with the view) out the window, obviously, but also just on how to solve problems, and I don’t want to lose that spark of inspiration.”",

        "title": "How spending time in space changes astronauts’ bodies: blurry eyes, puffy faces, ‘chicken legs’ and extra height",
        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nAstronauts Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Suni Williams are on their way back to Earth after nearly nine months in space and will soon be readjusting to life with gravity.\n\nDown to their DNA, astronauts’ bodies can change in weird and sometimes significant ways while high above Earth: They start to elongate, often developing a taller “space height,” and because human bodies are mostly liquid, redistribution of fluids may also give them “chicken legs” and a “puffy head.” Once they’re back, that all starts to return to normal.\n\nNASA doctors spoke to the two just before they started their journey home, and they said they’re doing “really well” health-wise, Dr. Joe Dervay, one of NASA’s flight surgeons, told CNN.\n\nScientists are still figuring out the long-term health effects of spending a lot of time in space, but decades of data show that astronauts undergo physical changes after even a brief period. Most of those changes will reverse themselves shortly after they return to Earth.\n\n“There is some individual variability on how quickly they recover, but it is pretty impressive to see how they will turn the corner and really adapt quickly,” Dervay said. “Oftentimes, if you look at them a couple days later, you really have no idea what they’ve just done for the last several months.”\n\nMicrogravity is behind many of the changes that astronauts can experience.\n\nWithout the pull of Earth, astronauts can lose bone density, and their muscles begin to waste away. They can lose motor control, coordination and balance in space, developing a kind of motion sickness, studies show. A lack of gravity can also affect their immune and cardiovascular systems, their vision and their very DNA.\n\nMost of the effects seem to be short-lived — only a handful of health issues have so far been found to linger — and the astronauts can look forward to a lot of rehab exercises on Earth to get their bones and muscles back into shape.\n\nAlthough Wilmore and Williams weren’t initially expected to stay on the International Space Station as long as they did – their initial trip was supposed to last only eight days – NASA leaders don’t believe the two will have any unusual health problems because of it.\n\n“We don’t see any need for any special precaution,” Dina Contella, deputy manager of NASA’s International Space Station Program, said Friday. “Like any astronauts coming back, there is an acclimation period, and so that will vary by crew member.”\n\nMuscle and bone deterioration\n\nWithout gravity for the body to move against and with the body exposed to radiation in space, muscle atrophy and dysfunction can happen to even the fittest astronaut. NASA has found that astronauts’ bodies can experience one-third reduction in muscle fiber size in less than two weeks.\n\nIn a single month in space, an astronaut might also lose up to 1.5% of their bone mass – about as much as a postmenopausal woman who is not in treatment loses in about a year. Such loss can make people vulnerable to fractures and lead to premature osteoporosis, but more research is needed to learn whether the bone loss persists long after the space flight.\n\nTo help mitigate bone and muscle problems, astronauts eat a special diet and do about 2½ hours of exercise daily, on average. They can use a treadmill or a stationary bike, but they also have a special Advanced Resistive Exercise Device that mimics weightlifting on Earth.\n\n“We try to keep the bone strong and muscles strong to minimize any effects of microgravity,” Dervay said. “Plus, from a psychological perspective, it’s outstanding because it gives them that break during the day, and they know they’re doing something for themselves.”\n\nNASA has been researching whether aerobics and resistance exercises would be as helpful as a treadmill, since the spacecraft needed for future long-distance flight may not be able to accommodate heavy exercise equipment.\n\nDervay says the body is “brilliant” in the way it adjusts to microgravity, but “we want to ensure that when we bring them home, they’re in the best position they can be to return … and get back into the normal flow of their lives.”\n\nAstronauts may view one physical change to their bones as a benefit: Without the pull of gravity, a person’s spine straightens, and they grow taller.\n\nNASA says the height of a crew member can increase 3% over the first three or four days of weightlessness. Astronaut Kate Rubins, for example, went from 5’6” to a “space height” of 5’7.” Once back on Earth, though, gravity brings astronauts back down to their regular size.\n\nNASA astronaut Kate Rubins is carried to a medical tent after she is helped out of the Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft in October 2016. The space capsule brought three astronauts back to Earth from a 115-day mission aboard the International Space Station. Bill Ingalls/NASA/AP\n\nChicken legs, puffy faces and blurry vision\n\nWithout gravity, fluids shift. Because the body is 70% liquid, that change is felt at multiple levels.\n\nOn Earth, fluids in the body tend to shift downward, below the heart. But in space, fluids flow evenly throughout the body and shift into places they don’t normally accumulate.\n\nIt’s similar to doing a very long handstand: The 1½ gallons of liquid the body carries move upward. Astronauts often say they feel like they have a head cold and develop an issue that some at NASA call “puffy face syndrome,” “bird legs” or “chicken legs.” The problems typically clear up after about three days on Earth, according to NASA.\n\nThe fluid movement in the body may also cause lingering back problems, regardless of the length of the space flight. One study found that the incidence of a slipped or ruptured disc is 4.3 times higher in astronauts than in terrestrial populations, and the problem typically happens soon after they return to Earth.\n\nThe fluid redistribution issue also seems to affect many astronauts’ vision, a problem NASA has dubbed Spaceflight Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome. The eye flattens due to fluid redistribution, the retinal nerve fiber layer can thicken, and there is a refractive shift so the vision can blur in space.\n\nDr. Michael Harrison, an aerospace medicine specialist at Mayo Clinic in Florida, says it’s a bit like using a projector and moving it a few inches closer to the wall.\n\n“The picture is going to get a little fuzzier,” he said. “It’s a major topic because we don’t know an awful lot about it yet.”\n\nThe problem seems to be more common with longer space flights.\n\n“The question that is on everybody’s mind is, what happens when we go deeper into space for longer periods of time? Does it plateau, or is this something continues to progress?” Harrison said.\n\nNot everyone’s vision remains changed. One study found globe flattening in about 16% of astronauts post-flight.\n\n“Some folks come back and do have what appears to be – maybe not necessarily permanent changes but chronic changes in vision and requires glasses. Others don’t have it. It’s a fairly new phenomenon,” Harrison said.\n\nTo study the phenomenon, the crew of the five-day commercial flight Polaris Dawn wore special contact lenses last year to measure and collect data on the pressure in their eyes.\n\nNASA has also developed special “space anticipation glasses” that are kept at the International Space Station. The glasses are adjustable and mitigate some of the blurriness.\n\nFluid in the brain tends to shift in space as well, from the top of the brain to the base. Studies of astronauts after they return to Earth have found that this shift can enlarge parts of their brains called ventricles, even beyond what can typically be seen with normal aging.\n\nHowever, MRIs of the crew of the Polaris Dawn mission didn’t find any concerning findings with their brains.\n\nChanges at the cellular level\n\nTime in space can weaken a person’s immune system and make astronauts more susceptible to infections. The white blood cells that help the body fight infections seem to change.\n\n“In space, there’s been activation of some latent viruses that folks carry but no health effects associated with that long-term,” Harrison said.\n\nSpace also seems to chemically modify a person’s DNA. On the International Space Station, astronauts wear dosimeters to record their radiation exposure, since it can damage DNA and raise the lifetime cancer risk\n\nIt’s not totally clear what effects other chemical changes to the DNA might have. A study that compared data during and after astronaut Scott Kelly’s mission to space against data from his identical twin brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, found that there were chemical modifications to both men’s DNA, but both returned to normal when they returned to Earth.\n\nTelomeres, the repetitive sequences at the end of a chromosome that protect it from deteriorating, typically decrease with age, but Scott’s telomeres actually increased while he was in space. When he came back to Earth, they shortened again. Scientists say Scott’s telomeres may have been positively affected by his better exercise and diet routine in space.\n\nReadjusting to Earth\n\nEven before they come home, Williams and Wilmore will have increased their fluids using salt tablets and water to try to get back some of what they lost during the early phase of space flight, Dervay said. They also put on garments like compression socks that stretch from the feet to above the waist to move fluid back to the centers of their bodies.\n\n“Every crew that comes back comes through a fluid loading protocol, just to make sure when they get back that their body is conditioned properly,” Steve Stitch, manager NASA’s commercial crew program, said Friday. “There’s nothing beyond what we’ll normally do.”\n\nThe astronauts do not return to their families right away after they splash down. Return-to-Earth protocols include keeping the crew at Johnson Space Center in Houston for several days before the flight surgeons give them the OK to go home.\n\n“Almost every organ system in the body is impacted to some degree – whether it’s the skin, the neurovestibular, the bone, muscle, the immunological system, the cardiovascular system – so we have programs that our Human Health and Performance team focuses on to try and make sure that we’re covering all those areas,” Dervay said.\n\nScientists monitor all astronauts’ health from the time they start training until long after they retire, but as more people spend more days in space, researchers are gaining a much better understanding of what effect it can have on human health in the long term. It’s knowledge that will be essential as government and commercial space programs aim to send humans for extended stays on the Moon and Mars.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore have spent extensive time in space before and told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in February that they know what to expect physically.\n\nAstronaut Takuya Onishi exercises during his rehabilitation program at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Tsukuba Space Center in November 2016. The Asahi Shimbun/Getty Images\n\nWhen astronauts return to Earth, their rehabilitation program may involve a series of physical exercises to increase bone density and strengthen muscles. They also do cardiovascular exercises to strengthen their heart muscle, since it doesn’t have to pump as hard in zero gravity as it does on Earth. Additionally, there are exercises to improve coordination to help prevent injuries.\n\n“Gravity is really, really tough,” Wilmore told Cooper.\n\nWilliams said she usually gets her fast-twitch muscles back and her inner ear adjusts in about 24 to 48 hours after returning to Earth. She appreciates the quick physical improvements, but they’re also a little bittersweet.\n\n“That will be a little bit sad when [the dizziness] goes away, just because that means that really, physically, the space flight came to an end,” she told Cooper.\n\nFor at least some astronauts, mental health may have the biggest effects. They often experience the “overview effect.”\n\n“They get this profound experience that then influences their views on things when they return to Earth,” Harrison said.\n\nAstronauts describe seeing the world from above as “beautiful” and “fragile.” It is a world without borders or boundaries, and seeing it causes some to feel an increased sense of connection to others.\n\n“I’m not going to necessarily use the word ‘magical,’” Harrison said, “But it is a very profound philosophical experience being in space.”",

        "source": "https://www.cnn.com/",
        "content": "CNN —\n\nThe high-stakes call between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin expected on Tuesday comes as the White House insists it is closing in on a temporary ceasefire deal to pause the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nBut the call will be a key test of whether Trump, who’s largely echoed Putin’s view of the war since their call last month, can achieve his campaign trail promise of bringing the war to an end – and whether his friendliness toward Russia has paid off.\n\nA key priority for the call, sources familiar with the talks told CNN, is securing an agreement on concessions Russia is willing to make – including whether it’s willing to withdraw forces from territory it seized in the past three years since invading Ukraine.\n\nTrump himself suggested as much while speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, saying that US negotiators have discussed “dividing up certain assets.”\n\n“We’ll be talking about land. A lot of land is a lot different than it was before the war, as you know. We’ll be talking about land, we’ll be talking about power plants, that’s a big question,” Trump said.\n\nThe Kremlin has said that Putin has been readying himself for the discussion with Trump, having his staff work out talking points on Russia’s position.\n\nNegotiations to end the war kicked off after Trump and Putin spoke by phone last month, marking a resumption of communication after a long period of silence between the White House and the Kremlin. Since then, the president hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an Oval Office meeting that ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouting at him and asking the Ukrainians to leave, followed by the US temporarily pausing military assistance and intelligence sharing.\n\nWeeks of intense back-and-forth negotiations between top US officials — led by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz — and top Ukrainian and Russian officials led to a breakthrough, with the announcement of a US-led ceasefire proposal. After Zelensky said last week that his country had accepted the 30-day proposal, the US made clear the onus was on Russia to agree, with Trump saying, “Russia holds all the cards.”\n\nEfforts to bring Russia closer to an agreement intensified with Witkoff’s visit to Moscow on Thursday, where he met directly with Putin for several hours, CNN previously reported. Witkoff told CNN the meeting with Putin — his second known meeting with the Russian president this year — was “positive” and that the two sides had “narrowed the differences between them.”\n\nPutin believes “philosophically in a truce,” Witkoff argued, after the Russian leader laid out numerous reservations he had.\n\nWitkoff later flew to Florida to brief Trump on the discussions, and the president was so encouraged by Witkoff’s readout, the sources said, that he directed his team to begin preparations for a phone call with Putin.\n\nOver the weekend, Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\n“We are on the 10-yard line of peace,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday, adding that the US has “never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment.”\n\nA White House official reiterated that sentiment in a conversation with CNN, arguing that just a week ago they were “hundreds of miles apart, now we’re a couple hundred yards apart.” The official described Tuesday’s Trump-Putin phone call as the “natural next step” in negotiations.\n\nAn in-person meeting between Trump and Putin, which Trump said last month he envisioned happening in the near future, is likely to come up during their conversation, the official added.\n\nTrump and his team have repeatedly argued the fighting needs to stop before they can proceed to the far more complicated issues that need to be resolved in a longer-term peace deal, like drawing territorial lines and negotiating security support for Ukraine.\n\nBut Putin has publicly shared skepticism over the US proposal, with the Russian president saying last week that Ukraine must agree to specific concessions, such as halting mobilization and any training of its troops and that other nations must stop supplying weapons to Kyiv during the ceasefire.\n\nOne of his top negotiators, Yuriy Ushakov, dismissed the US ceasefire idea as “nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military.”\n\nAsked by CNN about Putin’s reservations and whether he was playing for time, Rubio said Friday: “We’re not going to make our foreign policy decisions on the basis of what a leader says, simply says at a press conference.”\n\n“This is going to play out the way things of this nature and caliber have traditionally and normally play out,” he added, “and that is with the leaders of the countries involved speaking, not in front of the cameras, not in front of the media, but in these negotiations that happen.”\n\nConcessions in question\n\nSenior US officials have repeatedly argued that any permanent off-ramp from the Russia-Ukraine war will include all sides making concessions, but they have also been reticent to publicly discuss details.\n\nAfter meeting with the Russians in Riyadh last month, Waltz said, “The practical reality is that there is going to be some discussion of territory.” Asked by CNN if it would be acceptable for Russia to retain territory it has annexed since 2022, Waltz said it was something “to be discussed.”\n\nRubio, ahead of a meeting with the Ukrainians last week, said they were in “listening mode” and “not going to be sitting in a room drawing lines on a map,” but wanted to “get a general sense of what concessions are in the realm of the possible.”\n\nIn an interview Sunday, Waltz was asked if “Russia could be given the Donbas in addition to hanging onto Crimea” – two Ukrainian regions it has occupied.\n\n“Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea?” he told ABC News. “We can talk about what’s right and wrong. And we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground. And that’s what we are doing through diplomacy, through shuttle diplomacy, through proximity talks,” he said.\n\nAlso likely to a point of discussion with Putin will be the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, which has been under Russian control since early in the war. Ukraine has repeatedly demanded that it be handed back, arguing that leaving it in Russian hands risks a radiological disaster.\n\nThe facility is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, but it hasn’t supplied power to Ukraine since Moscow took over the facility.\n\nAnother issue that American officials view as critical to a final agreement is access to Black Sea ports, which have been a consistent point of conflict. Russia has targeted Ukraine’s ports, while Ukraine has worked to push back Russian naval forces based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol.",

Hotels are expected to honor bookings unless force majeure occurs, in which case our Relocation team will assist,\" an Expedia spokesperson told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"If a hotel asks a traveler to cancel due to the booking rate, they should contact Expedia support via our 24/7 Virtual Agent on our site or app. If a partner consistently provides a poor traveler experience, we investigate and address the issue directly.

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "Eight years after receiving a life-shattering diagnosis, a New Jersey mother credits an \"amazing\" new drug for stopping her disease in its tracks.\n\nRaziel Green, 52, an active runner and mother of two, was diagnosed with a rare form of ALS in 2017.\n\nThe former retail manager first started experiencing symptoms more than 10 years ago, when her legs started to feel heavy during what would normally be an easy run, Green told Fox News Digital during an on-camera interview.\n\nNEW MEDICATION FOR ALS ELIGIBLE FOR FAST-TRACK FDA APPROVAL\n\n\"A couple months later, I started to struggle going up the stairs at my house,\" she recalled.\n\nSeveral months later, when Green started to experience balance issues and muscle loss, she decided to see a neurologist, who told her there was nothing wrong.\n\nKnowing that her mother and aunt had both been diagnosed with a rare form of ALS, Green pushed for more opinions and tests. It wasn't until she saw a third neurologist, who specialized in genetic diseases, that she was diagnosed with superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nThe disease, which is caused by mutations in the SOD1 gene, accounts for approximately 10% to 20% of genetic ALS cases and 1% to 2% of sporadic ALS cases, according to the ALS Association.\n\nSERVICE DOG HELPS BOY WITH RARE GENETIC DISORDER ACHIEVE ‘UNBELIEVABLE’ PROGRESS\n\nSoon after her diagnosis, Green learned about a clinical trial at Mass General for an experimental drug — QALSODY® (tofersen), which is made by Biogen in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThe medication is administered into the spinal fluid via a lumbar puncture every few weeks.\n\n\"We can speculate that because the drug targets the DNA, it could be curative if given early enough, but these trials have not been conducted yet.\"\n\n\"I was given the opportunity and was fortunate enough to be a part of the trial,\" she said.\n\n\"Knowing that we have the gene, I really wanted to do this not just for me and my family, but for others who have this form of ALS.\"\n\nWithin four months, Green said she saw a \"huge difference,\" and has not gotten any worse since.\n\n\"I saw a neurologist and she compared notes from between now and seven years ago, and she cannot see anything that is different from the day that I was diagnosed.\"\n\nBenefits and risks\n\nQALSODY is designed specifically to treat the SOD1 form of ALS by lowering the toxic effects of the mutations in the SOD1 gene, according to Timothy M. Miller, MD, PhD, vice chair of neurology research and co-director of the ALS Center at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nFAMILY SELLING DREAM HOME TO FUND LIFE-SAVING TREATMENT FOR 5-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER\n\n\"About 20% to 25% of people with SOD1 ALS treated with QALSODY have shown not only slowing of progression, but have had progression stopped altogether or shown signs of improvement,\" the doctor, who was not involved in Green’s care, told Fox News Digital.\n\nDr. Thomas Purvis, a neurologist at the West Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, called tofersen one of the \"most exciting medications\" for ALS in recent years.\n\nWhile the benefits seen during the 28-week trial period were \"modest,\" he said, patients began to look and feel better over the long term.\n\n\"This is often the case in clinical trials for chronic diseases — the benefit is better appreciated when the treated patients are followed over a longer period of time, so it is hard to say when the drug is newly released just how much benefit we can expect to see over the long term,\" Purvis, who also was not involved in Green's care, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We can speculate that because the drug targets the DNA, it could be curative if given early enough, but these trials have not been conducted yet.\"\n\nRARE DISEASE DIAGNOSIS STRENGTHENS BOND BETWEEN TWIN SISTERS: ‘DOING OUR BEST’\n\nThere have been some side effects seen in a small number of patients who have taken QALSODY.\n\n\"Approximately 7% of those treated with QALSODY in the clinical trial had serious side effects, including myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord), radiculitis (nerve pain), increased intracranial pressure and some others,\" Miller shared with Fox News Digital.\n\nSome rare effects included severe headaches, weakness and sensory loss, according to Purvis.\n\n\"Finally, we do not know the long-term consequences decades down the line after we expose patients to these therapies, simply because they have not been around long enough,\" he added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\n\"Current data, however, seems to tell us that the therapies are safe long-term.\"\n\nStephanie Fradette, Pharm.D., head of the neuromuscular development unit at Biogen (maker of QALSODY), noted that in the Phase 3 VALOR study, QALSODY-treated participants experienced a 55% reduction in plasma neurofilament levels, a marker of neurodegeneration, compared to a 12% increase in placebo-treated participants.\n\n\"As we look ahead at what’s next for ALS research, our work in SOD1-ALS has shown that it is possible to slow the devastating neurodegeneration that occurs in this disease,\" Fradette told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We are continuing to apply lessons from our recent research in SOD1-ALS, as well as research we have done over the last decade, to help us bring safe and effective therapies to the broader ALS community.\"\n\n‘Hope to keep going’\n\nGreen expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to take QALSODY, which has now been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is available to anyone diagnosed with this specific gene mutation.\n\n\"I can still travel. I can still get myself up. I am still independent in my daily activities.\"\n\nEvery 28 days, Green goes to receive the medication.\n\nToday, she is somewhat limited in her mobility. She uses a cane full-time and a wheelchair for long distances — but given that her symptoms have not worsened, Green is still able to do many of the things she enjoys.\n\n\"I can still travel. I can still get myself up. I am still independent in my daily activities,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"I still go to the gym once in a while, when accompanied by someone.\"\n\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\nGreen has also been able to participate in her children's sports competitions, graduations and other milestones.\n\nThe medication has given Green — and other patients with the same gene — \"hope to keep going,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"And it gives my kids the opportunity to get tested and to have this medicine as a preventative treatment,\" Green went on. \"That was the main goal for me — to stay stable going forward after receiving the treatment.\"",

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has already surpassed one of her Biden predecessors in total number of PolitiFact fact-checks after just two months in office.\n\nOn Thursday, PolitiFact issued Leavitt her latest fact-check over her statement, \"Tariffs are a tax cut for the American people.\" PolitiFact rated it \"False\" with chief correspondent Louis Jacobson writing that \"virtually all economists\" have characterized tariffs as \"tax hikes rather than tax cuts.\"\n\nThis marked Leavitt’s third PolitiFact fact-check since beginning her tenure as press secretary in January, which officially put her ahead of former Biden press secretary Jen Psaki’s entire record of fact-checks on the site.\n\nKAROLINE LEAVITT SAYS AP REPORTER 'CLEARLY' FAILED TO GRASP TRUMP'S TARIFF PLAN AFTER HEATED EXCHANGE\n\nIn the sixteen months Psaki held the position, PolitiFact only fact-checked her twice, once in Nov. 2021 and once in Jan. 2022. Her November claim about Build Back Better was rated \"False\" while her January claim about COVID vaccines was rated \"True.\"\n\nIn contrast, Leavitt had her first two PolitiFact fact-checks on Jan. 30, less than two weeks after starting the position and nearly ten months earlier than Psaki. One was rated \"False\" while the other was rated only \"Half-True.\"\n\nThe more aggressive fact-checking right out of the gate was flagged by conservative media watchdog NewsBusters.\n\nThis also put Leavitt only one fact-check below former President Biden’s second press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, who received four fact-checks throughout her entire time behind the podium. Jean-Pierre held the position from May 2022 through January 2025.\n\nOut of the four times PolitiFact fact-checked Jean-Pierre, two were rated \"False,\" while the other two were rated \"Mostly True.\" PolitiFact also did not begin fact-checking Jean-Pierre until June 2022, about one month after her term began.\n\nPOLITIFACT EXECUTIVE RIPS META’S ZUCKERBERG FOR ANNOUNCING THE END OF FACT-CHECKING ON HIS PLATFORMS\n\nComparatively, fellow press secretaries under President Donald Trump such as Sean Spicer, Kayleigh McEnany and Sarah Huckabee Sanders have also been fact-checked by PolitiFact more than press secretaries under Biden.\n\nMcEnany was fact-checked four times by PolitiFact over the period she was press secretary from 2020 to 2021.\n\nSanders received five PolitiFact fact-checks regarding comments she made during a White House press briefing, with one fact-check for an interview with ABC.\n\nSpicer received nine PolitiFact fact-checks during the six months he held the press secretary position in 2017.\n\nIn a comment to Fox News Digital, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said, \"PolitiFact’s so called ‘reporters’ aren’t fact checkers; they are left-wing crusaders dedicated to spinning the truth, perpetrating lies, and promoting the Democrats’ radical agenda. Karoline Leavitt has been so honest and transparent with the press that the fake fact-checkers at PolitiFact are having a hard time finding any facts to check.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to PolitiFact for a comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

Her father had previously asked police to investigate all possibilities.\n\nSudiksha Konanki, 20, vanished on March 6 after she went to the beach with seven other people around 4:15 a.m., according to surveillance video. Most of her group was seen coming back around 6 a.m., leaving her alone with Riibe, though he came back without her hours later.\n\nKonanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter, which has been obtained by Fox News.\n\nKEY WITNESS ASKS COURT TO END DE FACTO HOUSE ARREST\n\n\"Following an extensive search, Dominican authorities have concluded that Sudiksha is believed to have drowned,\" her parents wrote in a letter to La Policia Nacional, the country's national police force, Monday night. \"Her clothes were discovered on a beach near where she was last seen.

The DHS unveiled the app earlier this month after removing the Biden-era CBP One app, which was used to allow migrants into the U.S.\n\n\"People in our country can self-deport the easy way, or they can get deported the hard way, and that's not pleasant,\" Trump says in the video.\n\n\"The Biden administration exploited the CBP One app to allow more than 1 million aliens to illegally enter the United States.

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has released a list of five invasive animals that Americans can hunt, catch and cook.\n\nEating invasive species can help protect native wildlife by reducing the numbers and limiting the damage these species cause to ecosystems, FWS spokesperson Erin Huggins wrote in her list, which was published on the agency's website.\n\nFox News Digital spoke to various chefs and hunters to get their take on the flavor profiles of these invasive but \"downright delicious\" animals.\n\nALLIGATOR MEAT IS OK TO EAT ON FRIDAYS DURING LENT, HERE'S WHY AND HOW TO PREPARE IT\n\nCheck out these five.\n\n1. Nutria\n\nNative to South America, nutria are invasive inhabitants of the Gulf Coast, Atlantic Coast and Pacific Northwest, according to the FWS.\n\nAlso known by its scientific name of \"Myocastor coypus,\" the semiaquatic herbivore has meat that is \"lean, mild and tastes like rabbit,\" Huggins wrote.\n\nEric Cook, a New Orleans chef who owns Gris-Gris and Saint John restaurants, told Fox News Digital that nutria \"is such a crazy invasive species\" and was doing so much \"damage to the land\" that his group experimented with it on the menu.\n\n\"And it failed tremendously,\" he said.\n\n2. Northern snakehead\n\nThe northern snakehead, or \"Channa argus,\" is a sharp-toothed fish native to East Asia.\n\nThese air-breathing fish can live outside a body of water for several days and are able to wiggle from one freshwater habitat to another, according to the FWS.\n\nBEST FAST-FOOD FISH SANDWICHES AROUND THE COUNTRY\n\nNorthern snakeheads were first found in a pond in Maryland in 2002; two years later, they were detected in the Potomac River, according to the FWS.\n\nThey've since been spotted throughout nearly all the Chesapeake Bay watershed.\n\nCommonly found in mid-Atlantic or southeastern U.S. waterways, the snakehead \"is a meatier white meat, edging toward chicken,\" said Ryan Callaghan, MeatEater's director of conservation in Bozeman, Montana.\n\nHuggins described the snakehead as having \"firm, white and flaky meat.\"\n\n\"Try them in fish tacos, grilled or fried,\" she wrote. \"Just make sure they don't bite you first.\"\n\n3. Green iguana\n\nThe green iguana is arguably the most visible of all the invasive animals on the list.\n\nNative to Central and South America, these cold-blooded invaders have made sunny South Florida their home away from home.\n\nARE ROTISSERIE CHICKENS REALLY HEALTHY? WHAT TO KNOW\n\nThe large, plant-eating lizards thrive in South Florida's warm climate, enabling them to reproduce and become a regular sight for residents and visitors alike.\n\nDarcie Arahill, a Florida-based angler and content creator of Darcizzle Offshore YouTube videos that teach the art of fishing, said that these iguanas \"breed like rabbits\" and are \"here to stay.\"\n\n\"They don't eat any kind of meat, but because they're vegetarians, they threaten the native wildlife or the native plants and flowers that we have here in Florida,\" Arahill told Fox News Digital.\n\nIguanas also dig tunnels that erode seawalls, Arahill said.\n\nShe's harvested them and posted YouTube videos about how to cook them.\n\nFAMILY'S CHICKEN LAYS 'GINORMOUS EGG' 3 TIMES THE NORMAL SIZE\n\n\"Iguana is really good,\" she said.\n\nArahill, who lives along a canal, said she uses her bow and arrow to shoot them in her backyard. She said the tail is the \"best part,\" but the bigger the lizard, the more meat there is on the legs.\n\nArahill likes to boil iguana meat in water with potatoes and carrots, almost like a stew, \"to the point where the meat just falls off the bone.\"\n\nThen she'll plate the stew on top of rice – \"and I swear it is so good.\"\n\nArahill said iguana tastes like pulled pork.\n\n\"You don't know the difference,\" she said.\n\n4. Invasive carp\n\nAnother invasive fish is the carp.\n\nBighead, silver, black and grass carp species, native to East Asia, are collectively known as invasive carp.\n\nCOMPANY OFFERS CASH FOR ESCAPED FISH IF CAUGHT BY 'REGISTERED FISHERMEN'\n\n\"Invasive carp are fast-growing and prolific feeders that out-compete native fish and leave a trail of environmental destruction in their wake,\" according to the National Invasive Species Information Center's website.\n\n\"The four types of invasive carp currently found in the U.S. were imported into the country for use in aquaculture ponds. Through flooding and accidental releases, black, grass, bighead and silver carps found their way into the Mississippi River system.\"\n\nBecause the Mississippi River system serves as a \"giant freshwater highway,\" this has given invasive carp species \"access to many of the country's rivers and streams,\" the site also says.\n\nMeatEater's Callaghan, who has some experience with bighead and silver carp, told Fox News Digital that the taste is \"very mild to almost neutral.\"\n\nHe said they're zooplankton feeders, \"so they don't have to work very hard.\"\n\nThe carp's bone structure is \"probably the biggest reason they haven't taken off as a grocery store fish,\" Callaghan said. It \"takes some practice to filet them efficiently and avoid the bones.\"\n\n5. Feral hogs/wild boar\n\nFeral hogs or wild boars, known by their scientific name \"Sus scrofa,\" are a \"full-blown ecological disaster,\" Huggins wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nNative to Europe and Asia, these animals can be found in the Southeast, Texas, California and beyond.\n\n\"I have never had a bad hog.\"\n\nWild hogs can be found throughout Florida in a variety of habitats. Yet according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, they \"prefer oak-cabbage palm hammocks, freshwater marshes and sloughs, pine flatwoods and more open agricultural areas.\"\n\nThese swine \"eat a variety of plants and animals and feed by rooting with their broad snouts. They may disturb the soil and ground cover vegetation and leave the area looking like it has been plowed.\"\n\nDanielle Prewett, a Texas hunter, chef and author of the cookbook \"MeatEater's Wild + Whole,\" told Fox News Digital that hogs would \"tear up all of the pastures\" on her family's ranch — so she and her husband \"built a huge trap\" to catch them.\n\n\"That's one way to harvest these hogs,\" Prewett said.\n\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\nAs a food, Prewett said, hog gets a bad rap.\n\n\"I have never had a bad hog,\" she noted.\n\nWhile \"a lot of people have a lot of really negative things to say about hogs,\" Prewett said, she believes it mostly has to do with \"how the meat is processed.\"\n\n\"Hogs have several glands, scent glands underneath their skin, and if you accidentally cut that when you're removing the hide and processing it, it can really tank the meat and make it smell and taste really, really terrible,\" Prewett said.\n\nShe said hog is \"really delicious,\" but the flavor of every animal is \"going to be based upon whatever it is that they're eating.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"If you're eating [hog from] somewhere where there's no good food source, they're going to taste differently and reflect that,\" she said.",

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "Don’t mess with Randy Andy and his teddy bears.\n\nPrince Andrew reportedly has an obsession with his prized collection of teddy bears, which must be placed in perfect order in his bedroom.\n\nThe claim was made by royal author Tom Quinn, who has penned a new book, \"Yes, Ma’am: The Secret Life of Royal Servants.\" It’s based on hundreds of interviews with former and current palace staff members.\n\nDOES KING CHARLES STILL TRAVEL WITH HIS CHILDHOOD TEDDY BEAR? AUTHOR CLAIMS TO KNOW THE TRUTH\n\nA spokesperson for Buckingham Palace previously told Fox News Digital that they don’t answer for the Duke of York as he’s no longer a working royal. However, a spokesperson told Fox News Digital, \"We don’t comment on such books.\"\n\n\"The story of Prince Andrew and the teddy bears is very revealing,\" Quinn told Fox News Digital. \"Various members of staff who’ve worked for him have told me this is very typical of him. He is quite eccentric, and he has a collection of teddy bears, which he insists are placed every day in a certain position… a pyramid shape. And he gets very cross if it’s not done properly… He really doesn’t do anything for himself.\"\n\n\"He has a member of staff who puts the teddy bears in order,\" Quinn claimed. \"There are quite a few – 20 or 30 – in the position that he likes every day. And I know that in the past… if they’re not placed exactly as he wants, he can be quite short-tempered and angry about it. So when he finds someone who is very good at it, he clings to them, and he gets the same person to do it every day.\"\n\nAccording to Quinn, the 65-year-old isn’t a favorite among palace aides.\n\n\"A lot of his staff don’t think very much of him because they think he’s entitled and quite bad-tempered,\" claimed Quinn. \"And a lot of his bad temper, I think, is frustration because, in many ways, he felt he would be a better king than Charles, his brother. [Andrew] is less introspective, he’s less sensitive. He’s more of a… tough guy. And I think he feels frustrated even more now that he’s no longer a working royal. He does tend to take it out on the staff.\"\n\n\"Again, that’s something that many members of staff and ex-members of staff have said to me,\" said Quinn. \"He’s too fussy. And the teddy bears are a good example of that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nIn his book, Quinn wrote that Andrew \"has his collection of teddy bears lined up in order on his bed every day and if anything is out of place, he loses his temper.\"\n\nQuinn claimed that a particular maid was assigned each day to arrange the teddies \"because she tended to get it right and Andrew liked her.\" But when it came to the rest of his staff, Andrew could often behave as if they \"were irritatingly stupid.\"\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Andrew’s reported love of cuddly toys has come to light. In the 2024 Netflix drama \"Scoop,\" viewers see a frustrated Andrew, played by Rufus Sewell, berating one of his maids for not organizing the bears on his bed correctly.\n\nIn 2022, former Buckingham Palace maid Charlotte Briggs claimed to The Sun that she was responsible for laying out Andrew’s soft toys in order of size every morning in the mid-‘90s. The royal, who was reportedly Queen Elizabeth II’s favorite son, would have been in his mid-30s. She claimed to the outlet that he had 72 teddy bears at the time.\n\n\"As soon as I got the job, I was told about the teddies, and it was drilled into me how he wanted them,\" Briggs claimed to the outlet. \"I even had a day’s training. It was so peculiar. After all, he was a grown man who had served in the Falklands. Each had to be carefully positioned. They were old-fashioned teddy bears – the Steiff ones – and nearly all of them had sailor suits on and hats.\"\n\n\"It took me half an hour to arrange them,\" Briggs claimed. \"Then, at bedtime, I had to take all the teddies off and arrange them around the room. They each had a set place. We had to stack the smaller ones in an unused fireplace, again in size order, to make them look pretty. His two favorite bears sat on two thrones on either side of the bed. The others would sit at the foot of the bed on the floor.\"\n\nBriggs claimed that if the bears weren’t placed correctly, he would lose his temper.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nThe Sun also reported that in a 2022 ITV documentary, Paul Page, who was in the Royal Protection from 1998 to 2004, claimed he saw \"about 50 or 60 stuffed toys\" on the prince’s bed when he worked for the palace.\n\n\"There was a card… in a drawer and it was a picture of all these bears,\" Page claimed, as quoted by the outlet. \"The reason for the laminated picture was if those bears weren’t put back in the right order by the maids, he would shout and scream.\"\n\nAt the time of the documentary’s airing, both Buckingham Palace and a spokesperson for Andrew declined to comment.\n\nVogue also noted that Andrew himself once spoke about his love of teddy bears.\n\n\"I’ve always collected teddy bears,\" he said in 2010, according to The Sun, as quoted by the outlet.\n\n\"Everywhere I went in the navy, I used to buy a little teddy bear, so I’ve got a collection from all over the world of one sort or another,\" he reportedly said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOne thing Andrew reportedly doesn’t tolerate are facial moles. Several former servants claimed to Quinn that Andrew had a member of his staff removed because he disliked a mole they had. They also claimed Andrew had another member of his staff moved because he was wearing a nylon tie.\n\n\"He’s really fussy about things that the rest of us really would think were irrelevant,\" Quinn claimed to Fox News Digital. \"There’s a very good example of a member of staff who had a large mole on their face. Andrew didn’t like this. He wasn’t directly rude to the person who had the mole, but he arranged for them to work somewhere else so that he didn’t have to see them, which was unkind.\"\n\n\"The rules are very strict for staff,\" said Quinn. \"As a result, [they] can be treated quite harshly. Another example is that one member of staff was wearing a tie that wasn’t silk. It was made from nylon. He was also moved.\"\n\n\"And it just isn’t Andrew,\" Quinn insisted. \"There’s also a famous story about [his brother] Prince Edward. He complained because his chauffeur was looking in the rearview mirror of the car too often. Edward was said to be really cross with him for doing that.\"\n\n\"One servant who worked as a footman just after the Second World War for the royal family, said, ‘Oh, we were just pieces of furniture. We just have to look good. We didn’t have the sort of employment rights people have now,’\" Quinn continued. \"There are a number of stories… It’s a mixture. Sometimes [the royals] are very unkind to staff. Other times, they are extraordinarily kind to staff. It depends on who you get.\"\n\nQuinn also pointed out that Andrew isn’t the only one with quirks.\n\nKING CHARLES, OTHER BRITISH ROYALS TRAVEL WITH BAGS OF BLOOD FOR THIS REASON, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY SAYS\n\nHe claimed in his book that King Charles has \"little bursts of irritation with his staff\" if he isn’t given the right teacup, perfectly polished shoes and toothpaste neatly squeezed onto his toothbrush in exactly the way he likes it.\n\n\"He loses his temper in a split second, but usually quickly regrets it,\" Quinn wrote.\n\nChristopher Andersen previously claimed in his book \"The King\" that, like Andrew, Charles has a soft spot for his childhood teddy bear.\n\nWATCH: KING CHARLES' COMICAL QUIRKS REVEALED BY ROYAL INSIDER\n\n\"Charles has a very strict routine, and he hates his routine being disrupted,\" Quinn told Fox News Digital. \"He gets very irritated. When a member of staff draws a bath for him, if it’s not exactly the right temperature and depth, he gets very irritated. If his shoes are not polished exactly as he likes them to be polished, he can become quite irritable, even angry.\"\n\n\"Most famously, and he absolutely insists on this every day, he has six eggs cooked for him,\" Quinn claimed. \"He believes that’s the only way to make sure at least two are perfectly cooked to his liking. The others are just discarded… There is also the famous story about Charles and the toothpaste. He expects the toothpaste to be put on his brush each day.\"\n\n\"To be fair to him, that all started when he hurt his arm after falling from a [horse] while playing polo,\" Quinn continued. \"You tend to become obsessive about these little things because you can’t go out and get a job, or you can’t leave the palace and just go shopping on your own. You become more and more eccentric.\"",

        "content": "Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., took aim at The Daily Beast's \"nasty\" headline on Monday that took an exchange she had with President Donald Trump out of context.\n\nAlex Isenstadt, Axios reporter and author of \"Revenge: The Inside Story of Trump's Return to Power,\" made headlines with quotes allegedly said by Trump in a sneak preview published by Axios on Sunday.\n\nAmong the quotes was one he allegedly said to Luna in 2023 offering her the bed on his jet when she was pregnant and feeling ill, though it included a joke about his wife Melania being jealous.\n\n\"If you need a bed to lay down in, there's one here on the plane. If you feel sick and you need to lay there, you can lay on it. Just don't tell Melania. She doesn't like other women on my bed,\" Trump said to Luna, according to Isenstadt, who noted in the Axios sneak preview that Trump was joking.\n\nTRUMP'S LAWSUIT AGAINST PULITZER PRIZE BOARD MEMBERS MOVES FORWARD AFTER JUDGE DENIES TEMPORARY STAY REQUEST\n\nHowever, The Daily Beast ran the headline \"‘Don’t Tell Melania’: Trump Once Offered Rising MAGA Star His Bed,\" teasing to readers, \"The alleged comments cast new light on the president’s eyebrow-raising marriage to Melania Trump.\"\n\nThe report acknowledged Luna was \"unwell\" in the first paragraph but didn't mention the joking nature of Trump's comment until the fourth.\n\nTRUMP APPLAUDS JEFF BEZOS' CHANGES AT WASHINGTON POST IN RARE MEDIA PRAISE\n\nThe Daily Beast shared its story on X further implying an inappropriate relationship between Trump and Luna, writing, \"The new revelations reveal how Trump reportedly offered a female congresswoman his bed, as long as she kept it a secret from his wife.\"\n\nLuna did not take kindly to The Daily Beast's reporting.\n\n\"I seldom respond to nasty headlines because I don’t like giving trash credibility, however, being that there is allegedly a book coming out with me named and attacking @POTUS, his marriage, our first lady, and frankly implying something distasteful about me, I am responding,\" Luna wrote on X.\n\nKAROLINE LEAVITT SAYS AP REPORTER ‘CLEARLY’ FAILED TO GRASP TRUMP'S TARIFF PLAN AFTER HEATED EXCHANGE\n\n\"I was very pregnant and at the time experiencing pre-eclampsia symptoms, but was not diagnosed,\" she explained. \"As soon as @realDonaldTrump boarded the plane, being the gentleman and good person that he is, said if I did not feel well, I could use the back room. He did this in a respectful way and in front of my husband, of which we thanked him. He also assured me that they had a medical team on board in case anything happened and they were aware of how pregnant I was.\"\n\n\"This was the most compassionate thing that could’ve been done at the time. I find it disgusting that the author fails to recognize that,\" Luna continued. \"A few weeks later, I was induced because I did have pre-eclampsia . The author of this book never reached out to me for comment. Which means that this book is likely going to be a s--- hit piece. If people in POTUS orbit are talking to this author, they need to be cut off immediately. This is gross.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast was later hit by Community Notes, which read \"The woman in question was Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who has responded publicly to the allegation.

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nIn the period of most intense conflict during World War II, Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin contended against Hitler, Mussolini and the leadership of Imperial Japan (primarily Hideki Tojo) for control of the world. Armies and navies circled the globe, clashed repeatedly over vast spaces. The cost in lives soared above 70 million people as a result of that cataclysm.\n\nThe peak war years occurred after Hitler had double-crossed Marshall Stalin and invaded the Soviet Union. That Stalin had been our enemy the day before did not matter the day after Operation Barbarossa launched. Suddenly Stalin was part of \"the big three\" with Churchill and FDR.\n\nThere are many great and inspiring figures from that era who played major roles in defeating the Axis Powers, and even among the \"big three,\" Harry Truman would replace FDR after the latter’s death just as Clement Attlee replaced Churchill on July 26, 1945 after an election dissolved the national government after VE Day, but before VJ Day.\n\nBENJAMIN NETANYAHU PRAISES TRUMP'S ‘REMARKABLE IDEA’ ABOUT A US TAKEOVER OF GAZA\n\nThere were so many legendary figures of enormous but still secondary importance — Generals George Marshall, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight Eisenhower, Admirals Ernest King and Chester Nimitz and France’s great inspiration Charles DeGaulle, China’s long dueling combatants and sometimes allies against the Imperial Japanese, Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek, and a host of senior military and civilian leaders commanding armies of millions across continents.\n\nBut for much of the time there were only the five men who mattered most and who had the authority to decide the great and dread questions: Churchill, FDR, Stalin, Hitler and Tojo.\n\nWe have found ourselves in another of those moments of history where only a handful of very powerful figures make decisions for the world: United States President Donald Trump, People’s Republic of China General Secretary Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and … Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThere are other executives with nuclear weapons in their countries’ arsenals, primarily Indian Prime Minister Modi and Pakistan’s Pakistan National Command Authority. North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has a small arsenal and is erratic but not apparently suicidal. None of these powers are in anything like the current \"big four.\"\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron control nuclear arsenals, but would never even think of rattling them without U.S. consent and guidance.\n\nIt is a world almost wholly dependent on four men who must be understood by the other three to be willing, if they needed to, to unleash hell on the planet in retaliation for a nuclear strike on their homeland.\n\nThis is not an imminent risk now as it was, say, during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Whatever we think about Putin — and he is a war criminal — he does not seem intent on triggering Armeggedon. None of them do. The most dangerous situation is the desire for the PRC to take over Taiwan, but Xi must know that the United States and its allies would oppose such an invasion and by means quite extraordinary and sufficient to the task, via capabilities only hinted at in public. So the world is, while not peaceful, stable as to the superpowers and their potential for conflict among themselves.\n\nBut one government, possessed in the future of such a nuclear weapons arsenal, would in fact pose an imminent risk of nuclear Armageddon for it is a regime of theocrats — fanatics who may see it as their religious mission to bring about the apocalypse: The Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nWhich is why Saturday’s pulverizing strikes against the Houthis was such an important step for President Trump to take and why I think the war against Hamas will resume soon unless Hamas releases its remaining hostages and escapes to Iran to hide there as best they can, even as Iran deconstructs its nuclear program in full view of the world. The world cannot afford fanatics with nukes and the world cannot afford a repeat of the horror of 10/7/23 when Hamas invaded Israel and slaughtered 1200, wounded 5,000 and kidnapped 250 innocents.\n\nOther powerful countries are rising in the world that will, eventually, obtain nuclear weapons. It has to be hoped that they are all countries with regimes that do not seek an end — literally — to history. Each will seek their own paths and develop their own alliances. It is to be hoped that the People’s Republic of China wants only superpower status and not an exclusive economic zone or an invasion of Taiwan which would almost certainly trigger Cold War 2.0 to escalate to World War 3.\n\nBut for the next 45 months, at least, the United States has a president and he and a set of advisors who will simply end the Iranian regime, likely in concert with Israel and moderate Sunni states, if Iran does not move quickly to disassemble its nuclear program, now naked and exposed after 17 months of direct and indirect war with Israel.\n\nAmerica is back as Israel’s strong strategic partner. The Biden regency of fog and confusion is past. Putin can chose too to take the off-ramp that Trump built for him in eight weeks, but that will be the Russian dictator’s call. If Putin refuses the end of the war, Trump should rally the West to President Zelensky in ways that dwarf the feeble and trembling half-steps of the Biden Regency.\n\nIt did not take long at all for the world to see everything as it is, even if the world doesn’t see everything the U.S. has at its command, the capabilities it can use. Ten thousand commentators with opinions and no clearances or authorities, and a thousand senior commanders with clearances and authorities but no opinions, just chains of command, are on watch. Rarely has everything been this clear.",

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he will likely be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, and the White House have since confirmed the call.\n\nTrump is eager to fulfill his campaign promise by making a deal with Putin to end the war in Ukraine, which he has called a \"bloodbath.\"\n\nHere's what to expect and what not to expect from their conversation.\n\nBoth Trump and Putin will likely remain cordial and respectful to each other, continuing to showcase their skills and talents in diplomacy. Unlike former President Biden and his VP Kamala Harris, who frequently got exasperated by Putin’s recalcitrance, calling him a \"killer,\" Trump does not insult Putin. The master of the Art of the Deal knows how to dance the waltz of diplomacy.\n\nPUTIN IN NO RUSH TO FOLLOW 'TRUMP TIME' CEASEFIRE PROPOSAL\n\nUnderneath the facade, neither Trump nor Putin trust each other. Smiles and positive gestures notwithstanding, in his first term, Trump pursued the most forceful anti-Russia policy since Ronald Reagan. He authorized lethal aid to Ukraine, sanctioned the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, booted out Russian spies who operated out of its embassy posing as diplomats, and shut down three Russian facilities in the U.S. that effectively served as espionage operating bases targeting the homeland. Trump also took several measures to mitigate Russia’s ability to exploit vulnerabilities in America’s way of war, which is highly reliant on technology.\n\nIn turn, Putin views Trump as an extremely difficult and worthy opponent, someone who is unpredictable and hard to manipulate the way the Russian dictator played previous presidents: Bush, Obama and Biden. In 2017, when asked by a journalist if he was disappointed in Trump after the closure of Russian diplomatic facilities in New York, Washington and San Francisco, Putin called the question \"naïve.\" The former KGB operative said Trump is \"not my bride, and I’m not his groom.\"\n\nIn 2018, after the summit in Helsinki, Putin mocked the idea that Trump trusted him: \"You can’t trust anyone. Where did you get the idea that Trump trusts me and I fully trust him?\" Putin told journalists. \"He [Trump] defends the interests of the USA, and I of Russia.\"\n\nIndeed, feelings and emotions are simply not part of the statecraft that serious and strong heads of state use when dealing with each other, especially when it comes to Russia and the United States, both of which consider themselves exceptional great powers.\n\nWhen it comes to the substantive side of the Trump-Putin deal on Ukraine, there will be no breakthrough on Tuesday. But both sides will likely report positive progress with no specific details.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe 30-day ceasefire deal is unachievable. Putin is highly unlikely to be compelled to accept a ceasefire because he is prepared to fight until the bitter end.\n\nAs President Trump recently admitted, Putin \"holds all the cards.\" Washington could and likely will apply even more severe economic pressure on Moscow, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett recently suggested. Hassett claimed that there’s \"a heck of a lot of things\" that Trump is ready to use as part of his \"carrots or sticks\" strategy to pressure Putin.\n\nBut the Russians believe Team Trump are bluffing, suggesting that it’s too risky to play the cards involving global economic ramifications. The Russians think more aggressive sanctions against Russia’s energy sector would backfire, resulting in even higher prices here. Regardless, Moscow believes it can weather sanctions, as it has done thus far. Indeed, no economic sanctions have changed Putin’s behavior in the past decade.\n\nPresident Trump likely senses that a deal with Putin is harder to make than he thought. By making it his campaign promise, Trump might have boxed himself into an unachievable timeframe, giving Putin leverage. Trump’s Russia advisers should have laid out clearly for the commander in chief the complexity of the Russia-Ukraine issue that Washington had stepped into by pushing Ukraine into NATO in the first place.\n\nThe Russian media is praising Putin’s \"six words\" message to an \"impatient\" Trump (My za mir, no est’ nyuansy, in the Russian language), referring to Putin’s recent televised statement in which he claimed that Russia is for peace, but \"there are nuances.\" On Sunday, Trump claimed that he was \"being a little bit sarcastic\" when he promised on the campaign trail to end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Sunday night, speaking with journalists on Air Force One, Trump sounded more realistic and clear-eyed.\n\n\"We want to see if we can bring that war to an end,\" he said. \"Maybe we can, maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance.\"\n\nIf the commander in chief realizes that Putin is stringing him along, he will cancel the call and walk away. Letting Putin stew might soften him up, prompting a comeback if the Russians really want peace. The mess that President Trump inherited from Biden and the Europeans will almost certainly not be resolved in a phone call, if at all.",

There are no Tariffs if you manufacture or build your product in the United States.\"\n\nThere is broad agreement among economists that tariffs are a tax on imported goods that are normally paid by the importing company, which in turn passes on some or most of the cost of the tariff to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nBut Trump’s top officials have repeatedly quelled any concerns that tariffs will negatively impact the U.S. jobs market or consumer prices.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\"There's a big group of countries where we have a small surplus, but we don't do a lot of trading with them,\" Bessent said.\n\n\"And then there's what we would call kind of, 'the dirty 15,' and they have substantial tariffs,\" he added, pointing out that \"as important as a tariff or some of these non-tariff barriers\" are, where they do testing or have domestic production \"bear no resemblance to safety or anything that we do to their products.\"\n\nREAD MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS\n\nFOX Business’ Eric Revell contributed to this report.",

He said it gives the public a look at what these students say, \"without the keffiyehs on.\"\n\n\"It was just shocking how much I uncovered in such a small period of time,\" Fox told Fox News Digital, noting that the students were unafraid of supporting antisemitism. Fox noted that he only met them seconds before they \"just poured out all this antisemitism.\"\n\nAfter speaking with students, Fox said that \"Jews have just become target number one at this school.\"\n\nPRO-ISRAEL INFLUENCER SAYS BIBAS MEMORIAL IN NYC 'BROUGHT OUT THE WORST' IN ANTISEMITES\n\nIn the video, Fox wears a disguise and pretends to be a British student named \"Ben Klein.\" He wore a pro-Palestinian shirt, a keffiyeh, a COVID face mask and a nose ring. Fox admitted that his costume made him \"look like a narc,\" and he was surprised so many people thought he was genuinely an anti-Israel activist.\n\nAt one of the more shocking points of the video, a Barnard student who said she studies \"human rights and economics\" said there is \"nuance in terrorism.\"\n\n\"I think ‘terrorism’ is one of those words where people haven’t actually thought about the meaning,\" the student says in the video. Later in the video, she also agrees when asked whether there is \"nuance to rape\" if it is used as a weapon of \"resistance,\" such as the number of rapes committed during the attacks on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\n60 UNIVERSITIES UNDER INVESTIGATION BY TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FOR 'ANTISEMITIC DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT'\n\nWhen speaking about this student, Fox said that he was stunned when she called herself a \"queer for Palestine\" but could not seem to explain why she supported a movement that actively persecutes gay people.\n\nFox said these anti-Israel students \"don’t actually want to free Palestine from Hamas.\" He told Fox News Digital that he found Hamas supporters while interviewing people near the Ivy League campus. In the video that was posted, one unidentified female said there are \"students who are more sympathetic to Hamas.\"\n\nIn addition to the anti-Israel students, Fox spoke with some Jewish students while undercover. One of the students who is featured in the video said he felt unsafe at Columbia.\n\n\"My takeaway is that it just feels like Barnard because it is, you know, seen as this female institution. I think it is more poisoned with a lot of this DEI propaganda that really has turned Jews into a full-on White colonizer class,\" Fox told Fox News Digital.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe pro-Israel influencer told Fox News Digital that diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives must be ended because he believes they are \"intellectually poisoning students.\" He praised the Trump administration’s efforts to root out DEI from the federal government.\n\nFox admitted that his own views on DEI had changed since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks. He said that he was someone who did not see the harm that DEI initiatives could do until this past year and a half.\n\n\"It is such a disservice to intellectual thinking and free thinking,\" Fox told Fox News Digital.\n\nIn addition to ending DEI initiatives, Fox believes mask bans should be in place, with exceptions for medical reasons. Fox says that forcing students to go unmasked would put an end to the building takeovers and disruptive anti-Israel demonstrations seen on campuses across the country over the last year and a half.",

        "content": "Klickitat County Sheriff Bob Songer is calling out the \"lunacy\" of Democratic leadership in deep blue Washington after state Attorney General Nick Brown launched a lawsuit against one of his colleagues for helping enforce immigration law.\n\n\"They honestly feel that they can just run over everybody,\" he said, adding, \"Bring it on, I'll fight them.\"\n\nBrown, a Democrat, sued the Adams County Sheriff’s Office on Monday, accusing the office of \"illegally collaborating\" with federal officials and the Trump administration.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in Spokane County Superior Court, claims that the Adams County Sheriff’s Office’s holding of illegal immigrants in custody based on their immigration status, helping federal agents question people in custody, and \"routinely\" sharing personal confidential information of Washington residents with federal officials \"expressly violates state law.\"\n\nTOM HOMAN WARNS MAJOR SANCTUARY STATE WILL ‘GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY DON’T WANT’\n\nThe suit cites a 2019 law called the Keep Washington Working Act, which prohibits law enforcement in the state from providing aid in immigration enforcement. Brown is asking the court to force the Adams County Sheriff’s Office, led by Sheriff Dale Wagner, to comply with the Keep Washington Working Act.\n\nThis comes the same week that U.S. Border Patrol Chief Michael Banks posted on X that agents had partnered with the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office to arrest a Mexican national and suspected illegal firearms dealer, including rifles, shotguns and pistols.\n\nA representative for the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office declined Fox News Digital’s request for comment.\n\nSonger, who has vowed to help ICE, told Fox News Digital that the attorney general’s lawsuit is part of a broader effort by Washington’s leading Democrats, including Gov. Bob Ferguson, to intimidate sheriffs into complying with the state’s sanctuary policies.\n\n‘GET GEARED UP’ BECAUSE ‘ICE IS COMING,’ SAYS LEADING HOUSE GOP MEMBER\n\nHe shared that two days after Trump’s inauguration his office received a public records request from an individual named Charles Harvey for all of his personal and official phone, text and email communications with federal authorities from 2021 until the present. The request stated that if any communications between Songer and ICE were found they would be reported to the attorney general’s office.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE\n\n\"In my opinion, it's lunacy. They are whack nuts,\" he said. \"Why would a governor and legislator and Brown, the new attorney general, why would they not want law enforcement to cooperate with ICE to go after bad people that are illegally in our country that have committed felonies and very serious felonies?\"\n\nHe commended Wagner and the Adams County Sheriff’s Office for standing their ground, calling the attorney general’s lawsuit \"flat ridiculous.\"\n\nYOUNG FATHER KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT HIGHLIGHTS 'BETRAYAL' OF SANCTUARY CITIES, SAYS REPUBLICAN\n\nSonger said he would not be intimidated by the threat of investigations or lawsuits because he believes the Constitution is on his side.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I hope my fellow sheriffs will stand up to the governor and this state and tell them these laws are unconstitutional and we're not going to cooperate,\" he said. \"We just need to pay attention and follow the Constitution and I think if we do that, we're going to have a better country.\"\n\n\"Citizens come first,\" he concluded. \"And I pray, I absolutely pray for Tom Homan to come to Washington state, the blue state and sanctuary state, because I really believe Ferguson, Brown and their cohorts, elected politicians, are in violation of federal law. And if they are, lock them up.\"",

        "source": "https://www.foxnews.com/",
        "content": "EXCLUSIVE– Lawyers are demanding answers about alleged efforts by a Texas high school to repeatedly use a masculine name and male pronouns for a biological teenage girl, despite objections by parents.\n\nLawyers sent a letter to Texas' largest school district after parents believed their daughter was secretly socially transitioned at school.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative legal advocacy group, sent a demand letter to Bellaire High School (BHS), which is part of the Houston Independent School District (HISD), on behalf of the student's parents, asking for records from the school in accordance with Texas' open records law.\n\nIn the fall of 2023, BHS employees began referring to the female student by a masculine name and male pronouns without her parents' notification or consent, the ADF letter claims. The parents found out in December 2023 when they discovered a masculine name on their daughter’s schoolwork, in which they promptly told her teachers to stop using that name immediately.\n\nIn response, their daughters’ teachers told them that they would only refer to her by her legal name and female pronouns. But, despite teachers' initial assurances, they discovered a few months later that school employees were again using the masculine name and male pronouns, according to the letter. The parents asked the high school employees, again, to stop, and they assured them that they would, but they allegedly still did not.\n\nKANSAS SCHOOL DISTRICT: GENDER IDENTITY CAN BE KEPT FROM PARENTS, AVOIDING PREFERRED PRONOUNS CAN CAUSE DEATH\n\nIn September 2024, the student's parents met with Bellaire’s principal, Michael Niggli, where they asked for confirmation that school employees would only refer to their daughter by her given name and female pronouns, according to the letter. But, the ADF says, Niggli told them they should consider a \"middle ground\" solution around what name she would be called at school.\n\nThen, the parents followed up in writing, emailing Principal Niggli to clearly state that HISD employees should only refer to their daughter by her given name and female pronouns. He responded that \"there will be no emails with directives to call [your daughter] by any particular name,\" according to the letter. Principal Niggli also reportedly told the parents that a school counselor had communicated their instructions to teachers, but ADF claims that, because teachers have ignored similar instructions from them before, they are not confident that this is currently the case.\n\nADF is asking HISD to assure the student's parents that its employees are following their instructions regarding their daughter. They are also asking for documents relating to HISD employees’ gender-identity-related use of preferred or chosen names or pronouns for students, including policy, practice, or guidance documents, or training presentations and associated documents. The letter's deadline, set by ADF, is Friday, March 21.\n\nVincent Wagner, senior counsel with the Center for Parental Rights at Alliance Defending Freedom, told Fox News Digital that if answers aren't provided and details aren't clarified, it could result in legal action.\n\n\"If that's not what happens, then we have to consider what else is on the table and that could be litigation,\" he said. \"It's still up in the air what the next steps would be and that will depend on the specifics of HISD's response.\"\n\nThe story attracted attention after a representative for the parental action group, Moms for Liberty, spoke at an HISD school board meeting last month on behalf of the girl's mother, who has chosen to remain anonymous.\n\n\"On the first day of ninth grade, my daughter's theater teacher sent home an information sheet for us to fill out,\" the Moms for Liberty representative read last month on behalf of the mom. \"The second line of the sheet asked for her pronouns. Multiple teachers started calling her by a different name and pronouns. One teacher even went as far as to cross out my daughter's legal name that she had written on her paper and write her chosen name in red ink.\"\n\nPENNSYLVANIA DEPT OF EDUCATION WEBSITE LISTS GENDER-NEUTRAL PRONOUNS ‘ZE,' ‘XE,' FOR STUDENTS\n\n\"This occurred without our knowledge and certainly without our consent. This goes against our Christian faith, the advice of her therapist and, quite frankly, common sense. We met with her teachers, counselors and principal, to no avail. HISD is purposely and secretively transitioning minors…\" she added, before her time was up and her mic was cut.\n\nThe public statement caught the attention of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who said he instructed the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to open an investigation into the allegations.\n\n\"No parent should have to endure this. Another reason why parents deserve school choice. No school should be involved in ‘transitioning’ a child,\" Abbott posted on X. \"If this is not already illegal, it will be after this session.\"\n\nWagner said ADF and the student's parents are primarily seeking relevant documents that should be available under the Texas Public Information Act, which the parents have allegedly filed repeatedly.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the school district for a request for comment.\n\n\"One responsive document showed that teachers were continuing to refer to their daughter by the masculine name even after our clients met with Principal Niggli,\" the ADF letter reads. \"So to understand exactly what HISD employees had been doing with their daughter, they sent a second public records request on January 3, 2025.\"\n\n\"In response to that request, HISD initially said it had over 18,000 responsive documents,\" the letter continued. \"Then a month later, it responded that it had no responsive documents and closed the request. It never provided a single document responsive to that second request—or even any explanation for the discrepancy.\"\n\nWagner said that a failure by HISD to comply with the Texas Public Information Act could lead to litigation about what the school district's responsibilities are to parents.\n\n\"Given the pattern of failure and the existing ambiguity, we ask that HISD promptly assure us and our clients that HISD employees will refer to their daughter only by her given name and female pronouns,\" the letter states. \"Please also send us copies of all correspondence sent that instructs HISD employees on how they may address our client’s daughter.\"\n\nTEXAS SCHOOL DISTRICT ADOPTS POLICY THAT TEACHERS MUST USE PRONOUNS CONSISTENT WITH STUDENTS' BIOLOGICAL SEX\n\nWagner said ADF is also seeking clarification on HISD's policy regarding transgender-identifying students, as well as any other guidance if there is no board-level policy.\n\n\"What practices does HISD follow in these sorts of situations, and also how are teachers trained to handle them?\" he asked. \"When you're telling teachers a kid is struggling with gender and has questions, what are you telling teachers to do about that? What instructions are being given to teachers and other employees about handling situations like these?\"\n\nHISD serves over 189,000 students at 274 campuses and is one of the largest employers in Houston, with about 27,000 employees, according to HISD's website.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Democrats seem to have been outplayed by Republicans when it comes to managing the latest government shutdown battle. And perhaps their biggest mistake was underestimating House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. By a 54-46 vote on Friday night, the Senate approved the funding bill to keep the government open that the Republican-controlled House had passed on Tuesday.\n\nAs bad as passing the continuing resolution would be, I believe a government shutdown is far worse. Senate minority leader chuck schumer\n\nThis shutdown cycle was not without drama. On Thursday, the evening before the deadline, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reversed the position he’d taken earlier in the week and vowed to help pass the House’s short-term continuing resolution bill. This must have been a tough call for the New York Democrat. As Schumer wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times, “As bad as passing the continuing resolution would be, I believe a government shutdown is far worse.”\n\nAnd while Schumer did not ultimately vote yes on the bill itself, his advocacy and yes vote on the cloture motion likely secured Friday night’s outcome.\n\nOn Friday morning at least, the Democrats were torn into two camps: fight Trump tooth and nail, which would lead to a shutdown and the potential chaos and pain that would bring, or swallow a partisan CR and at least keep the lights on. There were also specific fears that a shutdown would allow President Donald Trump and Elon Musk to accelerate some of their most aggressive agenda items, including mass federal layoffs and governmental reorganizing. “Musk has already said he wants a shutdown, and public reporting has shown he is already making plans to expedite his destruction of key government programs and services,” said Schumer from the Senate floor on Thursday.\n\nSchumer calculated ultimately the Democrats would be blamed for the impact on “the most vulnerable Americans, those who rely on federal programs to feed their families, get medical care and stay financially afloat. Communities that depend on government services to function will suffer.”\n\nHowever, in many ways, the die had already been cast. On Tuesday night, Johnson passed the spending bill with nearly unanimous GOP support. And then promptly sent his members home.\n\nThe speaker certainly had some help from both the president and White House officials. Trump himself was working the phones, while Vice President JD Vance reportedly “assured Republican members that Trump would continue cutting federal funding with his Department of Government Efficiency initiative and pursue impoundment — that is, holding back money appropriated by Congress.”\n\nJohnson is often thought of as the accidental speaker. And it’s true that he was pulled out of quasi-obscurity after the caucus took down his predecessor Kevin McCarthy just 17 months ago. At the time of his elevation, Johnson had no leadership experience, and the political class had very low expectations. But he had Trump in his corner.\n\n(Trump did blow up a bill in December carefully negotiated by Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. But Johnson eventually prevailed, with Democratic votes, and a spending bill was passed.)\n\nLast December's funding bill was always a temporary stopgap measure that would only fund the federal government through March 13, 2025. More surprising was that Johnson was able to get the House to pass its budget outline last month, with only losing a single vote. This should have served as a canary in the coal mine moment for Democrats.\n\nThe real blunder Schumer made was miscalculating just how good Johnson has become at playing political hardball. The thought of Johnson passing a six-month continuing resolution with just Republican votes seemed highly unlikely last year, and that was what both Jeffries and Schumer were counting on. They were operating on the premise that, just like with the last CR, Republicans were going to need Democratic votes to get the bill to the president’s desk, leaving room for negotiations.\n\nJohnson defied the odds and passed the CR, losing just one Republican vote, and picking up an extra yes vote from Maine Democrat Jared Golden. That left Schumer floundering, and with only one option to keep the government open.\n\nThere is a lesson to be learned here, and now would be a good time for Democratic leadership — as well as Senate Majority Leader John Thune — to recognize Johnson’s skills. They don’t have to like him or agree with him, but going forward they should respect him, and maybe even fear him.",

        "content": "The latest national NBC News poll asked American voters which country has their sympathies in the Russian/Ukrainian war, and the results weren’t close: Only 2% of Americans sided with Vladmir Putin’s regime, while 61% chose U.S. allies Kyiv. The same poll, however, asked about Donald Trump’s sympathies, and a 49% plurality said they believe the Republican president is sympathetic to Moscow.\n\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey along with a GOP colleague, said, “I cannot recall a moment in history when American public opinion and voters’ views of a president, as to which country they are more aligned with, have been more in conflict with each other.”\n\nThere is no reason to see the poll as an outlier. The latest national survey from Quinnipiac University found that a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the war and believe he hasn’t been tough enough on Putin. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll also found that more than half of Americans agreed that the president is “too closely aligned” with Russia. Similarly, the latest CNN poll found that a majority of Americans disapprove of the Republican’s policies toward Russia and Ukraine, and 50% said his approach to the war is bad for the United States. (For more information on the polls’ methodologies and margins of error, click on any of the above links.)\n\nWith data like this, it’s tempting to think the American president, who’s been a little too eager of late to align his administration with Moscow, might consider a change in direction. He’s not. On the contrary, Trump continues to double and triple down on his unpopular approach.\n\nDuring his unhinged remarks at the Justice Department late last week, for example, the president falsely suggested that Ukraine tried to “pick on” Russia. The next day, for reasons that weren’t altogether clear, Trump published a 150-word item to his social media platform, insisting that Putin was punctual for his meeting with “my Highly Respected Ambassador and Special Envoy, Steve Witkoff” — who is not actually an ambassador.\n\nAround the same time, NBC News published this striking report:\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia was excluded from high-level talks on ending the war after the Kremlin said it didn’t want him there, a U.S. administration official and a Russian official told NBC News. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg was conspicuously absent from two recent summits in Saudi Arabia — one with Russian officials and the other with Ukrainians — even though the talks come under his remit.\n\nDuring the presidential transition process, Trump announced that the retired general would oversee the administration’s policy toward the war, but the NBC News report, published late last week, said Moscow made it clear behind the scenes that it did not approve of Kellogg.\n\nThe next day, Trump announced that Kellogg would now have a new job, serving as his special envoy to Ukraine. It led reporter Laura Rozen to note that it “looks like Trump let Russia veto one of his negotiators.”\n\nIn case that weren’t quite enough, as this week got underway, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration has informed our longtime European allies that the United States is withdrawing from the International Center for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine — a “multinational group created to investigate leaders responsible for the invasion of Ukraine.”\n\nThe Trump administration “is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declared two weeks ago. “This largely aligns with our vision.”\n\nThe latest polling suggests this is not what the American mainstream wants. The American president doesn’t seem to care.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A few weeks ago, Donald Trump and his White House team took an unprecedented step, punishing a prominent private law firm, Covington & Burling LLP, because it assisted with former special counsel Jack Smith’s investigations. The New York Times described the move as “a breathtaking escalation.”\n\nA week later, the Republican president did it again, punishing Perkins Coie, a large international law firm with some prominent Democratic clients.\n\nThe tactics did not go unnoticed. Indeed, when Perkins Coie filed suit, challenging the legality of Trump’s order, U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell temporarily blocked the president’s policy, saying in reference to the executive order, “It sends little chills down my spine.” The judge added, “I am sure that many in the profession are watching in horror at what Perkins Coie is going through.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a constitutional scholar, had a similar reaction, describing the White House’s offensive as “dangerous as hell.”\n\nThe president didn’t appear to care. In fact, in an interview that was aired early last week, the Republican told Fox News that there were other law firms that he also intended to target. Evidently, he was serious. The New York Times reported:\n\nPresident Trump on Friday opened a third attack against a private law firm, restricting the business activities of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison just days after a federal judge ruled such measures appeared to violate the Constitution.\n\nAccording to the order, the move was motivated partly because the firm employs Mark Pomerantz, who assembled evidence against Trump years ago while working at the Manhattan district attorney’s office, and partly because a partner at the firm worked on a case involving a Jan. 6 rioter.\n\nA Politico report noted, “Top law firms are debating whether to make a public show of support for three major firms that have come under attack by the Trump administration. ... But they’re racked by private worries they’d be targeted, too.”\n\nIn other words, the president is already retaliating against some of the largest law firms in Washington, D.C. Other firms could step up and denounce such tactics, but they know they’d likely end up soon after on the West Wing’s retaliation list.\n\nBut while it’s very easy to believe this campaign reflects Trump’s larger drive to turn his second term into an extended revenge tour, there’s another element to this that’s worth keeping in mind.\n\nRight now, with Congress’ Republican majorities in the House and Senate acting like presidential employees, the most meaningful barrier between Trump and his goals is the judiciary — an institution where he and his policies have struggled quite a bit over the last several weeks.\n\nWith this in mind, the rationale behind the offensive against law firms becomes even more obvious: The White House likely wants to stop losing in the courts, and the surest way to prevent those defeats is to discourage nervous law firms from taking cases that Trump won’t like.",

        "content": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was supposed to be touring the country this week, signing and selling copies of his new book. Instead, the New York senator postponed the whole tour over “security concerns.” More specifically, the concern was that liberal activists, angry at his decision to acquiesce to Republicans’ recent government funding bill, were planning large protests at every event.\n\nIt’s undoubtedly embarrassing for Democrats that their leader in the Senate is ducking scenes of being called a coward by voters in his own party. But that the very fact that the party’s base is so livid at its leadership could be good news. Recent history tells us that that anger may be crucial if the Democrats are to back from their current lowly position.\n\nAnd that position is truly lowly. In new polls by NBC News and CNN, the Democratic Party has reached its lowest approval rating ever recorded: 27% and 29%, respectively. In both cases, these declines came about because many Democrats now say they disapprove of their own leadership.\n\nVoters in the Democratic base are clearly hungry for representatives who will oppose Trump loudly and without embarrassment.\n\nAnd why wouldn’t they? As Democratic voters watch in dismay while Donald Trump and Elon Musk dismantle the federal government and explore new frontiers of authoritarianism, they see few encouraging signs from too many of their leaders. The three living Democratic ex-presidents haven’t been heard from since Trump took office. Former Vice President Kamala Harris has been mostly invisible. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose presidential ambitions are no secret, is chatting it up with far-right activists and commentators on his new podcast. And while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, unlike Schumer, kept his caucus together to oppose the recent funding bill, he has largely been ineffectual.\n\nAnyone active on social media has seen a Democratic electorate enraged at Schumer and the other Senate Democrats who joined him in voting to advance the budget bill. In fairness to Schumer and these other senators, they argue that as bad as the bill was, a government shutdown would have done even more damage, especially since Trump and Musk could use the opportunity to eviscerate key agencies and shove thousands more government workers out the door. One might disagree with this view — and with Schumer’s messaging strategy — but it isn’t a crazy position to take.\n\nNevertheless, voters in the Democratic base are clearly hungry for representatives who will not only find the most pragmatic ways to counter Trump, but who will oppose him loudly and without embarrassment. That’s why figures such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Jasmine Crockett (D-Tex.) are commanding ever-larger followings as Democrats who seem to grasp the urgency of both the moment and their voters’ emotions.\n\nThat desire for fighting spirit is reflected in the polls. When NBC’s poll asked at the beginning of Trump’s first term whether Democratic voters wanted representatives who would “make compromises with President Trump to gain consensus on legislation” or “stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington,” they favored compromise by a 59-33 margin. Today, the numbers have flipped: Democratic voters now favor fighting, 65-32.\n\nSome Democrats in Congress would protest that without formal institutional power, there’s only so much they can do to thwart the president. That was the dilemma Republicans found themselves in during Barack Obama’s presidency. Even GOP voters considered Republican lawmakers feckless and weak, so they voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act an astonishing 70 times (depending on how you count).\n\nA base that has decided it can’t rely on leadership will start organizing for itself.\n\nIn the end, the repeal votes became a symbol of Republican impotence rather than resistance. Speaker of the House John Boehner was hounded from office in 2015 by tea party activists who considered him too weak to lead the fight against a president they despised. And Obama comfortably beat Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nBut look what else happened. Republicans took back the House, then the Senate and eventually the White House. They won sweeping gains at the state level: Democrats lost a net of 948 seats in state legislatures while Obama was president, the most a party had lost since Herbert Hoover was president, and 19 states saw chambers flip to Republican control.\n\nHow could that have happened while the national GOP looked so hapless? Ironically, the the national party’s poor standing may have helped spur its gains. That’s because an angry base is a motivated base, and a base that has decided it can’t rely on leadership will start organizing for itself.\n\nThat appears to be exactly what is beginning to happen now. Grassroots Democrats are organizing protests. Bernie Sanders is drawing crowds to his “Stopping Oligarchy” tour. The progressive group Run For Something, which helps liberals run for state and local offices, says it has signed up almost as many prospective candidates just since Trump’s inauguration as it did in all of 2017 and 2018. And activists are advocating primary challenges against Democratic leaders, just as tea partiers did to Republican leaders a decade ago.\n\nThat experience was uncomfortable for those running the party, but it showed that the party’s base was riled up and mad. And if some of Democrats’ anger is directed at their own leaders, that might be the most encouraging sign of a revival not just for the party’s institutions but its broader fortunes.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump is warning America that his economic plan could cause pain, unsettling the American public and financial markets. He’s not hiding it — he’s openly selling the idea that tariffs, government layoffs and cuts to social programs will send the economy into a downturn. His argument? That a recession now will lead to some vague \"golden age\" later. But that’s not how economies work.\n\nRecessions aren’t detox cleanses; they don’t flush out inefficiencies and leave you leaner and stronger. They are periods of mass job losses, closed businesses and financial ruin that leave lasting scars on families, workers and entire communities.\n\nRecessions aren’t detox cleanses; they don’t flush out inefficiencies and leave you leaner and stronger.\n\nWe know this because we’ve lived it — and not even that long ago. The 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession didn’t make the U.S. economy more efficient — it wiped out a generation of wealth, particularly for Black and Latino families, and left millions behind. The recession caused by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic deepened inequality and exacerbated housing insecurity, despite the fastest policy response in modern history.\n\nRecessions don’t set the stage for prosperity; they cause long-term damage that even a decade of growth can’t fully undo.\n\nTo be sure, some economists have argued recently that fears of a recession are possibly overblown. But an economic plan focused on causing deliberate harm to the American economy relies on old, discredited thinking: that recessions purge the system of waste, discipline workers into accepting lower wages and force companies to innovate.\n\nIn reality, recessions kill small businesses while the biggest corporations consolidate power. They drive up unemployment, forcing workers to take worse jobs for lower pay, and they weaken the very public institutions — like schools, health care and infrastructure — that enable long-term economic growth.\n\nEven worse, the current slate of proposed policies would actively make the economy more fragile.\n\nImposing broad tariffs would raise prices for consumers and manufacturers alike, increasing inflation while slowing down economic activity. Mass layoffs of government workers wouldn’t lead to leaner government — it would gut essential public services, hurting businesses that rely on those workers’ paychecks. And cutting Medicaid and Social Security wouldn’t create a more “dynamic” workforce; it would push millions into poverty, reduce consumer spending and force older Americans to stay in the workforce longer, crowding out younger workers from job opportunities.\n\nWe don’t have to theorize about what works. The past four years of economic policy have demonstrated how to grow an economy the right way: by investing in people.\n\nSince 2021, the U.S. economy has outperformed most other advanced economies, achieving strong gross domestic product growth beyond expectations. Here’s why.\n\nThe past four years of economic policy have demonstrated how to grow an economy the right way: by investing in people.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan injected direct financial relief into households, expanded the child tax credit and extended unemployment benefits, boosting consumer spending, preventing mass layoffs and cutting child poverty to record lows. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law accelerated investment in long-overdue infrastructure projects, creating jobs across industries like construction, transportation and water management while saving the average American household $700 per year. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act have revitalized domestic manufacturing, reducing reliance on foreign supply chains — all while keeping unemployment at historic lows.\n\nRather than forcing hardship in the name of a distant, uncertain recovery, these policies focused on expanding economic opportunity in real time.\n\nThis approach works because economic growth isn’t just about GDP figures — it’s about people’s ability to build secure, thriving lives. When workers have good wages and stable jobs, they spend money in their communities, supporting local businesses and driving demand. When public investments create new industries, they lay the foundation for long-term prosperity. And when economic policies prioritize affordability — lowering the cost of prescription drugs, housing and child care — they ensure that growth is shared, not just hoarded by the wealthiest few.\n\nThe Trump administration’s vision is clear: force a recession, break the public sector and weaken social protections, all hoping that something better will emerge on the other side. But history has shown us what actually happens — higher inequality, lower wages and an economy rigged even further in favor of the ultrawealthy. Economic downturns don’t just disappear once the pain subsides; they leave behind long-term damage.",

As David Corn explained for Mother Jones, Davis has a history of denouncing Israel’s government, which seems to have been the primary point of contention for Republicans.

In fact, it’s a horrifying choice that speaks directly to the concerns that Democrats expressed about Gabbard’s decision-making and loyalties in the lead-up to her confirmation vote.\n\nGabbard’s recent sharing of an X post by far-right influencer Ian Miles Cheong, a conservative propagandist based in Malaysia, only raised more questions about her alignment with some of the most unabashedly illiberal voices on the internet.\n\nSome netizens also have drawn attention to Gabbard’s association with pro-Putin influencer Jackson Hinkle, an advocate for the right-wing movement known as “MAGA communism,” after Hinkle wrote on X that Trump “should be doing TARGETED STRIKES on Kiev, London, Brussels & Paris — NOT YEMEN!”\n\nThe post below includes a photo of Gabbard sitting for Hinkle’s podcast in 2020, with a follow-up post showing the two surfing together in 2019.\n\nFor the record, these photos appear to have been taken before Hinkle became full-on MAGA, which is to say: If these were encounters with someone not known as a far-right propagandist, it might be defensible. Unfortunately, Gabbard has accumulated a long list of disturbing instances to choose from.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "With Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency leading the charge, the Trump administration is intensifying attacks on the Social Security Administration and jeopardizing the vital benefits 1 in 5 Americans rely on. Under President Donald Trump-appointed leadership, the SSA recently announced its intent to eliminate 7,000 jobs, slicing the agency’s already skeletal staff down to the marrow. The SSA’s shrinking workforce already has been covering an increasing number of beneficiaries for years. With no capacity to spare, the consequences could quickly turn dire.\n\nAs the baby boomer generation ages, a record number of Americans are hitting retirement each year, making this exactly the moment when seniors most need Social Security’s systems to function in order to access the benefits they have earned. But as former Social Security Commissioner Martin O’Malley recently warned, the administration’s actions could break those systems and interrupt benefit payments.\n\nThese attacks on the Social Security Administration coincide with other ominous signals about the program’s future.\n\nIf Social Security benefits stop — or even experience delays — the impact will be immediate and catastrophic. In a recent survey, 42% of Americans age 65 and up reported they wouldn’t be able to afford necessities like food, clothes or housing without their monthly Social Security retirement benefits. Over 11 million disabled Americans under age 65 also receive benefits through Social Security — payments that are subject to strict rules limiting recipients’ ability to earn wages or accrue savings. For these disabled Americans, too, even a few days’ delay could mean not putting food on the table.\n\nEven if the Social Security Administration can keep payments flowing to existing beneficiaries despite these cuts, the rollbacks will still harm people seeking benefits. Already, Social Security staff are inundated to the point of being unable to process retirement claims, compounded by an aging IT system experiencing an increasing number of outages. And more than 1 million Americans are waiting on an initial determination for a disability claim. Often they are forced to run up credit card debt or sell their home as they wait for an answer with little to no income and often no health insurance. Staffing cuts and overtime restrictions will slow processing further and worsen the backlog.\n\nThe Trump administration’s cuts will also chip away at the customer service that claimants need. On Wednesday, the agency suddenly stopped allowing claimants to change their direct deposit arrangements by phone. According to the Washington Post, the SSA and Musk’s DOGE team had considered ending phone service entirely, but abandoned the idea after the Post reported on the proposal.\n\nYet even the smaller change has big consequences: Claimants will be forced to visit a field office in person or use the internet simply to update their bank information. This presents real accessibility challenges: Senior Americans, who make up the majority of claimants, are least likely to have broadband internet access at home, while DOGE posts have stoked fears of upcoming field office closures. As for the services still available by phone, wait times have skyrocketed to hours.\n\nThese attacks on the Social Security Administration coincide with other ominous signals about the program’s future. Trump’s joint address to Congress falsely alleged “shocking levels of incompetence and probably fraud” lurking within Social Security. He threatened to “find out where that money is going,” and suggested it’s “not going to be pretty.” Meanwhile, Musk called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” — a frequent talking point of the program’s right-wing critics like Project 2025 author Stephen Moore. House Republicans have floated the idea of cutting Social Security benefits for some disabled children, and groups like the Republican Study Committee have sought for years to cut benefits by raising the retirement age. The current attacks on the Social Security Administration may only be the beginning.\n\nEach month, over 70 million Americans check their mailbox or bank account for their Social Security benefits. For many, these checks can mean the difference between making rent and losing their home, between buying groceries and going hungry. By hamstringing the agency that provides these critical benefits, the Trump administration is putting the well-being of millions on the line.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s attempt to deport pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil marks one of Trump’s most egregious assaults on democratic liberties since taking office. Yet too many Democrats, particularly in party leadership, are responding to Trump in the most mealymouthed way possible. But this is a problem of Democrats’ own making: Their trepidation stems from their own history of repressing speech critical of Israel — and now we’re all at risk of paying the price for it.\n\nKhalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, is a green-card holder who finished a master’s program at Columbia University in December (he is expected to graduate in the spring). He played a leading role in activism on Columbia’s campus last year objecting to Israel’s brutal treatment of Gaza, and served as a representative of student activists in negotiations with the university administration over a divestment campaign. A Columbia professor recently described him as a “consummate diplomat” who “seeks mediated resolutions through speech and dialogue.” He has an 8-month pregnant wife, who is a U.S. citizen.\n\nDemocratic leaders' response has been slow, divided and often feeble.\n\nThis legal permanent resident’s detention was made all the more disturbing by the way in which it was carried out. Khalil was detained in the lobby of his Columbia University-owned New York City apartment building on Saturday, with ICE agents changing their claims about his immigration status mid-arrest.\n\nAt first, the Trump administration provided no public legal explanation of its actions, even as it shipped Khalil to a detention facility in Louisiana. Green-card holders can be deported for certain crimes, but the government has not even charged Khalil with anything. Instead, the government is invoking an obscure provision of immigration law, which holds that an immigrant can be removed from the country if the U.S. secretary of state determines that their presence or activities are deemed to potentially have “serious adverse foreign policy consequences.” That’s why a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson has described Khalil as “aligned to Hamas.” But the administration has failed to provide any evidence or explanation for how this student activist is allegedly “aligned to Hamas” or poses a “serious” risk to U.S. foreign policy.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration is targeting him for his political speech and activism — and openly admitting that his arrest is meant to scare other pro-Palestinian activists. On Truth Social, Trump called Khalil a “Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student“ and warned that his arrest is the “first arrest of many to come.” He added: “We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it.”\n\nMany civil liberties advocates, centrist and left-of-center observers recognize Khalil’s detention as an assault on free speech. Georgetown legal scholar Steve Vladeck said that the Trump administration’s actions constitute “unconstitutional retaliation for First Amendment-protected speech.” The organization Jewish Voice for Peace said Trump’s actions were “designed to sow terror among students and immigrant communities” and its protesters poured into Trump Tower in Manhattan chanting “Fight Nazis, not students.” Donna Lieberman, executive director of NYCLU, likened Khalil’s detention to “McCarthyism” and described it as a “targeted, retaliatory, and an extreme attack on his First Amendment rights.” Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, described Trump’s move as “the kind of action one ordinarily associates with the world’s most repressive regimes.”\n\nSome Democrats have risen to the occasion. “We must be extremely clear: This is an attempt to criminalize political protest and is a direct assault on the freedom of speech of everyone in this country,” said a letter from 14 progressive House Democrats. Another letter, signed by over 100 House Democrats, said Khalil’s detention represents “the playbook of authoritarians, not of elected officials in a democratic society who claim to be the champions of free speech.”\n\nYet Democratic leaders’ response has been slow, divided and often feeble. New York Governor Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have refused to weigh in. And the statements of both House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer illustrate how caveats and hedging can undermine clear communication and standing for principles.\n\nBoth Jeffries and Schumer’s statements begin with caveats referencing how Khalil may have violated Columbia University’s rules and his behavior may warrant disciplinary action from the college regarding how he may have made Jewish students feel. But Khalil’s status at the university is irrelevant. At stake is his status in the United States. Bringing up Columbia’s disciplinary system allows Jeffries and Schumer to distance themselves from Khalil’s political cause. But the entire point of defending the First Amendment is to defend people’s rights to say things that are unpopular or even loathsome. (Note that nobody has provided evidence of how Khalil, who has denounced antisemitism, is antisemitic, and that Khalil’s lawyers say there is no evidence he supports Hamas.)\n\nBoth Jeffries’ and Schumer’s statements ask for the Trump administration to provide evidence of criminal activity in order to justify its actions. But that’s also a misfire: The Trump administration has made it crystal clear that this isn’t about criminal activity, but about political speech. A White House official even told The Free Press that “the allegation here is not that he was breaking the law.” Only after all the throat-clearing do the statements get around to saying that Trump’s actions appear to violate the Constitution in a measured tone.\n\nThe reason the mainstream of the Democratic leaders have been weak on this issue is because the party has been long opposed to the issue that Khalil represents — cutting off aid to Israel — and complicit in the free speech crisis themselves. President Joe Biden maintained almost uninterrupted military aid Israel, even as human rights observers and scholars described it as a genocide, and effectively aligned himself with draconian crackdowns on overwhelmingly peaceful pro-Palestinian student protests. And most House Democrats voted in favor of a bill conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Moreover, across institutions with ostensibly liberal cultures — in media, book publishing, the film industry and elsewhere — voices critical of Israel have been stifled or even purged. Khalil’s detention may violate the First Amendment, but in the U.S. there remains a Palestine exception to free speech.\n\nIf Democrats are wagering that this can be contained to one green-card holder, they are naive. Already Trump has canceled hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding to Columbia based on the pretext that it did not do enough to crack down on antisemitism. (This comes after Columbia expended immense resources to do so.) The message is clear: Trump wants to bully and intimidate as many institutions as possible to comply with its authoritarian assault on free speech. So far, Democratic leaders are not up for the fight.",

        "content": "Arlington National Cemetery has purged its website of pages about notable Black, Hispanic and women veterans, as well as information about the Civil War and Black history, as the Trump administration’s ongoing effort to remove references to “diversity and inclusion” on government webpages.\n\nAmong the pages that have disappeared from the cemetery’s website include links on the graves of prominent minority veterans, as well as educational pages on the Civil War, African American history and women’s history. Some of the information has been removed outright, while others were placed under categories that do not mention race or gender.\n\nAn archived version of the website’s educational page on African American history at the cemetery, for example, features a range of learning materials on the Civil Rights Movement and Black war heroes. That information no longer appears on the page.\n\nAn unnamed cemetery spokesperson told The Washington Post that links to webpages listing “Notable Graves” of Black, Hispanic and female veterans were taken down, and that the cemetery is working to make sure that content on its website complies with the administration’s policies.\n\nFirst reported by Civil War historian Kevin M. Levin and the military news publication Task & Purpose, the change follows Trump’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government.\n\nThe anti-DEI push has had a huge impact on the Defense Department in particular, where Secretary Pete Hegseth has vowed to get rid of what he calls “wokeness” in the military. Trump also fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. C.Q. Brown, the second Black man to hold the top military position, and pushed out Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the head of the U.S. Navy and the first woman to lead any branch of the armed forces.\n\n“I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength,’” Hegseth told Pentagon staff just days after being confirmed as defense secretary.\n\nSince then, the Defense Intelligence Agency has banned all activities related to cultural heritage celebrations, including Black History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, National American Indian Heritage Month, LGBTQ Pride Month, Women’s History Month, Juneteenth, Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nThe Pentagon is also seeking to bar trans people from serving in the military.\n\nIn February, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell wrote a memo ordering officials to “remove all DoD news and feature articles, photos, and videos that promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” by March 5. The Associated Press reported last week that the Pentagon has marked for removal more than 26,000 images of veterans from a diverse range of backgrounds and identities — which included an image of a B-29 aircraft that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima during World War II, the AP reported, because it was named “Enola Gay.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Those who watch Donald Trump’s Q&As invariably pick up on one of his go-to tactics. A reporter will ask a good and fair question that the president doesn’t appear to like, and instead of responding with something substantive, he’ll respond, “Who are you with?”\n\nAt that point, the journalist will respond by identifying his/her news organization, leading Trump to immediately and reflexively reply, “No wonder,” as if he’s proven some unstated point about independent news organizations asking questions that bother him.\n\nAt that point, the Republican will either move on — as if his childish rejoinder has sufficiently ended the matter — or he’ll respond in a way that suggests he considers the line of inquiry illegitimate.\n\nIt’s happened many times, including last week at an Oval Office event in which a reporter from Voice of America received the “who are you with?” treatment.\n\nThe snide exchange was uncalled for, but it was in keeping with the president’s longstanding disdain for VOA. When Trump tapped Arizona’s Kari Lake to be the next director of the Voice of America, many assumed that the network would continue, though it would be overhauled to be more overtly partisan.\n\nThose assumptions weren’t quite right. As The Washington Post reported, the president late last week signed an executive order seeking to eliminate several additional federal agencies, including the one that oversees the Voice of America.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) — the parent of VOA, Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia — is an independent agency established by Congress. In 2020, Congress passed a law intended to limit the power of the agency’s presidentially appointed chief executive. More than 1,300 journalists, producers and staff at VOA received an email saying they were placed on administrative leave Saturday, VOA Director Michael Abramowitz wrote on his private Facebook page.\n\nIn that same online message, Abramowitz also wrote, “[T]oday’s action will leave Voice of America unable to carry out its vital mission. That mission is especially critical today, when America’s adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States.”\n\nIt’s a key detail: As the Post’s report added, VOA exists “to counter authoritarian propaganda for foreign audiences with independent news.” That, evidently, is no longer in line with the White House’s international goals.\n\nIndeed, it’s worth emphasizing that while the gutting of the VOA generated headlines, it was not the only affected outlet: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty also lost its financing, and Radio and Televisión Martí, which promotes democracy to Cuba’s population, put its staff on administrative leave.\n\n“These media outlets have been a beacon of truth, democracy, and hope for millions of people around the world,” the European Commission said in a statement to Politico. “In an age of unmoderated content and fake news, journalism and freedom of press are critical for democracy. ... This decision risks benefiting our common adversaries.”\n\nThe Washington Post’s Max Boot added, “There is a sickening symmetry to President Donald Trump’s actions: While undermining U.S. democracy at home, he is also trying end U.S. government support for democracy abroad. His victims range from a leading human rights organization to the U.S. government networks that beam factual information to victims of oppression around the world.”\n\nWhat’s more, it’s worth emphasizing that the policy took effect quickly. This isn’t a situation in which the administration began a lengthy winddown process, assessing the policy implications over time. Rather, this is an instance in which Trump signed an order on Friday, and within two days, democracy-promoting networks were dark — for the first time in more than 80 years.\n\nSteven Herman, a longtime Voice of America correspondent, published a “requiem” over the weekend, writing, “To ​effectively shutter the Voice of America is to dim a beacon that burned bright during some of the darkest hours since 1942.”\n\nWhether Trump considers this a negative or a positive is not clear.",

        "title": "Trump's humiliation of Zelenskyy is plain as day in the rare minerals deal",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "If Ukraine needs a wake-up call regarding how much agency it truly has, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s humiliating decision to sign the rare minerals deal, which would see America and Ukraine jointly extract valuable raw materials such as lithium and titanium, will do the trick. It’s hard to get more symbolic than watching the head of a client state get lambasted in the Oval Office, having the United States cut off sharing intelligence with his military, then shambling back over to his overseer to pay up.\n\nThere are, however, two underreported facets to this shameful episode that can help us understand the nature of both Washington and Ukraine. We can witness, in real time, the masks coming off of Washington’s foreign policy complex; we can also see why this particular betrayal is so traumatic and painful given Ukraine’s tragic history.\n\nWe can witness, in real time, the masks coming off of Washington’s foreign policy complex.\n\nThe refreshing thing about President Donald Trump is that he speaks the quiet part out loud. Politicians and think tankers who comprise Washington’s sprawling foreign policy establishment — “the Blob,” as it was called by Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes — love warbling about Ukraine’s battling on the front lines of freedom and Kyiv’s being our cherished partner, brimming with agency and sovereignty.\n\nTrump doesn’t warble. Trump, who loves harping on Europe’s needing to pay for its own security, has made it clear that freedom ain’t free: If Ukraine wants the weapons it needs to hold Russia at bay, it better cough up its minerals.\n\nThe thing is, when it comes to looting Ukraine, the Blob is little different from Trump. Foreign policy insiders’ lofty concerns about Kyiv’s agency evaporate in the face of economic “opportunities.”\n\n“Putin had two goals in invading Ukraine: robbing its territory, and robbing its sovereignty by preventing them from joining NATO,” thundered Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., on Feb. 16.\n\nBut just one day prior, Sen. Coons was striking a markedly different tone about Ukraine’s minerals.\n\n“If this is an investment opportunity where American companies and other companies from Europe would be involved in mining and processing, so that we can be independent of Chinese sources of these strategic minerals, and if his helps deepen and strengthen our partnership to help ensure the security of Ukraine going forward ... that would be a positive thing,” he told CNBC.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s robbing Ukraine is a horrific violation of sovereignty; the United States’ doing so is a positive. Let freedom ring.\n\nOr take Peter Dickinson — the editor of a Ukraine-centric blog for the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank that receives funding from arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the kingdom of Bahrain, the Charles Koch Foundation and the U.S. Energy Department, among other luminaries. “We hear lots of talk about geopolitics and what Putin wants, but we should not underestimate the agency of the Ukrainian people or their desire for a democratic European future,” Dickinson told Bloomberg in 2022.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s robbing Ukraine is a horrific violation of sovereignty; the United States’ doing so is a positive. Let freedom ring.\n\nLater that year, the X handle of Business Ukraine Mag (a publication edited and published by Dickinson) took Elon Musk to the woodshed, posting, “Elon Musk seems unaware that Ukrainian sovereignty is not up for discussion.” Things appear to have changed last month, however, when Dickinson was quoted in a Politico article with the amazing headline “Ukraine reels in Trump with mineral riches.” (It could have also read: “Bully’s victim reels in bully with lunch money.”)\n\nDickinson acknowledged that for Kyiv, it “would mean a lot less mineral wealth in future” before adding, “But I doubt anyone is very concerned about that.” He continued, “Compared to the alternative of the country being wiped off the map entirely, it looks like a very good deal indeed! Most Ukrainians certainly seem to view it as perhaps distasteful but ultimately a no-brainer.”\n\nThe hypocrisy of Ukraine’s purported Washington advocates only deepens given the role its territorial resources play in Ukraine’s identity — and the danger that could lurk for Zelenskyy, of all people, if he is strong-armed into conceding them.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the role land plays in the Ukrainian psyche. One modern interpretation of the country’s blue-over-yellow flag is that it represents blue skies over the golden wheat fields of Ukraine. Even the months of the year are named after the agricultural cycle — August is Sickle-time, for the harvest; November is Leaf-fall, for autumn.\n\nThis love of their land — and fear of losing it — was watered with blood after Holodomor: the 1932-1933 manmade famine, courtesy of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, after he ordered the grain seized from Ukraine. The famine, which many (including me) consider a genocide, saw almost 4 million Ukrainians perish of hunger. Every morning, dead bodies littered the streets as people collapsed where they walked. Cannibalism was commonplace.\n\nStalin sold the stolen wheat to industrialize the Soviet Union, including its military, which was used to keep Kyiv under Moscow’s power for the next 50-plus years; Ukraine’s grain helped forge Ukraine’s chains.\n\nUltranationalist elements of Ukraine seized on Holodomor to create the antisemitic lie that the famine was orchestrated by Jews. Starting with World War II, that deadly trope was used to “justify” Ukrainian participation in the Holocaust, a “you killed us, we killed you” narrative that persists on the Ukrainian far right to this day.\n\nYou can see it in graffiti scrawled on a Jewish social services center in the western city of Uzhhorod in 2017: “We remember. 1932-1933. We’ll take revenge.” The years referred to the famine; the graffiti appeared on the day Ukraine commemorates Holodomor victims.\n\nThe image of Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s first Jewish president, signing away his country’s rare minerals couldn’t be more perfect for Ukraine’s far right. He might as well be maniacally rubbing his hands together while being handed a bag with dollar signs.\n\nConsidering Kyiv is teetering on losing the war, which could unleash various nightmare scenarios, that image is not just disgusting but dangerous. Jews haven’t done well when they have been blamed for wars.\n\nThe kicker to the rare minerals deal is that much of the resources are in Ukraine’s east, either in Russia-controlled territory or in a no-man’s-land covered with land mines. Realistically, Zelenskyy has as much ability to give them away as I do. The only bankable outcome of this sordid mess is just a further painful reminder of how screwed Ukraine is.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump took his most dramatic step to claim executive powers in his eighth week in office, invoking the Alien Enemies Act to begin deporting noncitizens without giving them a chance to go before a judge.\n\nThe 1798 law has been invoked only three other times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. The last time it was used as part of the legal rationale for Japanese internment camps.\n\nHere’s a mostly complete look at what else the Trump administration has done over the last seven days:\n\n• Invoked the 18th century Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador.\n\n• Denied that it violated a court order temporarily blocking the deportations, arguing it \"had no lawful basis.\"\n\n• Deported a 10-year-old U.S. citizen recovering from brain cancer and her family to Mexico after detaining them on their way to one of her medical checkups.\n\n• Claimed that pardons of House Jan. 6 committee members and some others by then-President Joe Biden were now \"void.\"\n\n• Ruled out an exemption for Australia on steel and aluminum tariffs, as the European Union announced retaliatory trade actions.\n\n• Threatened to double steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada if Ontario added surcharges to electricity sold to the U.S.\n\n• Fired 1,300 workers from the Education Department, effectively gutting an agency he's vowed to shut down.\n\n• Announced that another 1,000 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration workers will be laid off.\n\n• Put 1,300 staffers at the Voice of America on paid leave amid plans to shutter the news agency, which was set up during World War II.\n\n• Passed a spending bill with $485 million more for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and nearly $1 billion in cuts to the budget of Washington, D.C.\n\n• Made plans to fire workers who preserve and maintain 26,000 works of art owned by the U.S. government.\n\n• Promoted Tesla on the White House lawn and said vandalism against the company will be treated as domestic terrorism.\n\n• Disbanded two federal committees tasked with advising policymakers on food safety.\n\n• Expelled the South African ambassador for criticizing the Trump administration, calling him \"persona non grata.\"\n\n• Withdrew a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nominee who had questioned the measles vaccine.\n\n• Reversed more than 100 terminations of leases for federal buildings around the country.\n\n• Threatened to impose a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and liquor amid a trade war with the European Union.\n\n• Lost in court as two judges ordered the administration to reinstate thousands of fired federal workers.\n\n• Deported a kidney transplant doctor and professor even though a judge had issued an order blocking it.\n\n• Launched investigations into 52 universities, accusing them of \"racial preferences\" for diversity efforts.\n\n• Threatened to pull federal funding to Columbia University unless it overhauls admissions and cedes control of academic departments.\n\n• Faced a major protest as demonstrators took over Trump Tower to demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil.\n\n• Was sued by a group of Democratic state attorneys general over efforts to dismantle the Education Department.\n\n• Directed military officials to draw up options for increasing the troop presence in Panama, according to two U.S. officials.\n\n• Asked the Supreme Court to narrow court orders so that it can put into effect a new policy against birthright citizenship.\n\n• Terminated $20 billion worth of Biden-era grant agreements to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects.\n\n• Refused, in confirmation hearings for Dr. Mehmet Oz to lead Medicare and Medicaid, to commit to not cut Medicaid.\n\n• Sued, through various entities affiliated with Trump, Capital One bank for closing accounts after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n• Delivered a highly politicized speech claiming he was persecuted to officials at the Justice Department.\n\n• Argued in that speech that reporting by independent news outlets is biased and should be \"illegal.\"\n\n• Promoted Steak 'n Shake beef tallow-cooked fries in an interview with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n• Said, in an interview with the commerce secretary, that Trump's policies would be \"worth it\" even if they led to a recession.\n\n• Fired a pardon attorney who said she believes she was ousted because she refused to restore Mel Gibson's right to carry a gun.\n\n• Made plans for a registry that would require Canadians staying in the U.S. for longer than a month to get fingerprinted.\n\n• Criticized The Wall Street Journal by saying it's \"owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union.\"\n\nSubscribe to Trump’s First 100 Days newsletter for weekly updates on and expert insight into the key issues and figures defining his second term.",

        "content": "Victoria Ellen Bruce, my mom’s younger sister, loved to play bid whist, hear a good joke and never saw a purse she didn’t need. “Oooh, girl, give it here,” she’d say on the regular.\n\nAunt Vicki, who lived with multiple sclerosis for most of her adult life, died last year at a long-term residential facility where not even my mother’s dogged and formidable advocacy kept her from being neglected.\n\nAunt Vicki died at a long-term residential facility where not even my mother’s dogged advocacy kept her from being neglected.\n\nMost people living in long-term care facilities are on Medicaid. The program keeps them alive, paying for their care and housing. Shamefully, my House Republican colleagues just passed a budget proposal that cuts Medicaid to help fund tax breaks for wealthy Americans. Medicaid needs more money, not less.\n\nThe loss of Aunt Vicki has been painful for my family. My mother grieves every day. She thinks about her, talks about her and cries over her. Losing a younger sibling is incredibly hard, especially one as full of life, love, hope and faith as my aunt.\n\nJust as Aunt Vicki’s nursing career was taking off, we would go out to places and she would fall. It didn’t happen often but, after too many of these unresolvable episodes, she went in for tests and was diagnosed with the debilitating and incurable disease that is MS. We were all shocked. No one else in the family had ever had MS. The falls became more frequent. She was not able to continue her nursing career. A walker led to a wheelchair, a scooter and eventually a bed at a long-term residential facility.\n\nVictoria Ellen Bruce, right, with family members. Courtesy Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove\n\nMy aunt had the best caregivers in my grandmother (a nurse) and my mom (a Leo). They both fought hard against the system. Aunt Vicki loved receiving phone calls from me. We would talk, laugh and share stories. Eventually, she would tell me about some grievance with the nursing home, and then she would say how grateful she was for my mother for making it right. We should all be so lucky to have a caregiver as fierce as my mom.\n\nIn January, my mom came to Washington to watch me get sworn into Congress. Before she left, we discussed an article she had read about Melinda Lunday, who works for the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program. The ombudsman’s job is to visit assisted living facilities and residential care homes to ensure that patients, our family members, are not abused. Through my own research, I read about a patient who died after mistaking cleaning chemicals for juice. In some facilities, elderly individuals or patients with disabilities have gone unwashed for more than a year, do not get their teeth brushed regularly or are forced to sleep overnight in soiled briefs.\n\nThe ombudsman’s job is to visit assisted living facilities and residential care homes to ensure that our family members are not abused.\n\nAgain, even with my mother staying as vigilant as she was, Aunt Vicki was neglected by the system. As the MS worsened, she needed more consistent and observant care, but her health and safety became increasingly compromised because she didn’t get what she deserved.\n\nThe disease eventually made her completely bedridden. Because she stayed in the same position for hours at a time without being moved, she developed bed sores that turned into open wounds. The first time mom saw one of Aunt Vicki’s wounds, she said, “It was so deep, I could see to the bone.”\n\nMy mother would ride the nursing home administrators. That is the life of a caregiver. She would visit regularly, write letters, make phone calls and chew people out; Vicki’s care would improve for a little while and then backslide again.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, annual federal funding for the nationwide ombudsman program was set at $22 million and $27 million, well below what’s needed to fund the recommended ombudsmen-per-bed ratios. In 2023, there were 202,894 complaints regarding long-term care facilities, but only 4,943 ombudsmen staff and volunteers available to investigate.\n\nThat is a disgrace.\n\nFor many patients, their only advocate and hope is an ombudsman. Without them, many of our loved ones will suffer and die. That’s why it’s so unconscionable that Republicans are trying to slash Medicaid when it helps states pay for this critical program and others like it.\n\nIn 2023, there were 202,894 complaints regarding long-term care facilities, but only 4,943 ombudsmen staff and volunteers available to investigate.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is lying when he says Republican cuts will not touch Medicaid. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, it’s impossible to cut $880 billion from the House Energy and Commerce Committee budget, which Republicans want to do, without gutting Medicaid, Medicare or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. It’s mathematically unavoidable.\n\nCaregivers like my mom and patients like my aunt deserve a Medicaid program that is properly resourced so that it works for those who rely on it. Government programs cannot be efficient if workers are fired, funding is slashed and services are eliminated.\n\nI encourage people who’ve had an Aunt Vicki in their life to share their stories with their representative in Congress. We must breathe life into Medicaid with our experiences, so that everyone understands how vital this program is for our families and for the people we love.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Last week, the Trump administration crossed a red line in its unprecedented attack on American higher education. In a letter to Columbia University, the administration laid out a series of sweeping changes that the school must take to reverse the administration’s cancellation of $400 million in federal funding. The letter affirms that for the faculty and administrators at American colleges and universities, silence is no longer an option. They must speak out and act, both individually and collectively.\n\nIn canceling the grants earlier this month, the Trump White House accused Columbia of “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” The administration’s new letter details “immediate next steps that we regard as a precondition for formal negotiations regarding Columbia University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government.” Each of those steps touches on the university’s core functions.\n\nAmerican colleges and universities are in uncharted territory, and they are temperamentally unprepared for confrontation.\n\nAmong other things, the federal government demands that Columbia change its admissions practices and its disciplinary process, including mandating the “arrest and removal of agitators who foster an unsafe or hostile work or study environment.” It requires the university to ban masks “intended to conceal identity or intimidate others.” It even demands that the university put its Middle East, South Asian and African Studies Department in academic receivership.\n\nPutting an academic department in receivership would remove governance of that department, including control over its curriculum, from its faculty. As The Associated Press notes, receivership “is a rarely used practice,” and only if a department cannot manage its own affairs. That is not the case with respect to this particular department. One can (almost) admire the Trump administration’s ingenuity in using receivership as a smoke screen for censorship.\n\nNonnegotiable preconditions like these more commonly come from hostage-takers or terrorists than officials in a democratically elected government. But that is where this country and its higher education institutions now find themselves.\n\nIf the government can single out an academic department at a college or university because of what it teaches or how it teaches, there would be nothing left of academic freedom. We have seen hints of this kind of attack on higher education in this country before, especially during the Red Scare of the early 1950s. But according to Joan Scott, a historian and member of the academic freedom committee of the American Association of University Professors, the Trump administration’s latest demands on Columbia are “an escalation of a kind that is unheard of. Even during the McCarthy period in the United States, this was not done.”\n\nBefore the administration’s latest letter to Columbia, in an article aptly titled “First They Came for Columbia,” Harvard University’s Ryan Enos and Steven Levitsky called on their university to express solidarity with its fellow Ivy League school. “Autocrats — both left-wing and right-wing — always attack universities,” they wrote. “Its claim to be fighting campus antisemitism rings ... hollow ... Autocrats are allergic to sources of dissent, so they almost invariably seek to silence, weaken, or control them.”\n\nAmerican colleges and universities are in uncharted territory, and they are temperamentally unprepared for confrontation. They still emphasize discussion over direction and consensus over coercion, particularly as these institutions become more corporate.\n\nColleges and universities have little time to get their bearings, but passivity is the wrong path.\n\nAs Enos and Levitsky explain, “Most universities — including Harvard — have responded to these attacks with strategies of self-preservation. They are lying low, avoiding public debate (and sometimes cooperating with the administration) in the hope of mitigating the coming assault.” Those schools not yet in the government’s crosshairs are keeping their heads down lest they replace Columbia as the White House’s top target.\n\nColleges and universities have little time to get their bearings, but passivity is the wrong path. They need to organize in defense of Columbia now. This defense should comprise more than just statements. College presidents should go to Columbia’s campus and be seen with its president, lobby on its behalf with lawmakers, mobilize their alums, and, where possible, offer financial support.\n\nFailing to do so is, as Enos and Levitsky say, not only “morally objectionable,” but self-defeating. “Columbia’s leadership made repeated concessions to right-wing critics,” they point out, “only to be the first to come under attack.”\n\nThere is much to scrutinize and criticize about events at Columbia in the post-Oct. 7 period. But addressing those issues is not the federal government’s responsibility. All of us in higher education, not just university presidents, must say so.\n\nAs the New York Times’ M. Gessen noted last month, history teaches that “for people to be able to stand up (to authoritarianism), they needed the words.” That is why the administration’s attempt to bring Columbia and other universities to heel is so important, not just for the fate of higher education but for every American. Colleges and universities are in the business of fashioning the words and ideas needed to help people understand why standing up for democracy is so important.\n\nAll of us in higher education must get busy with that work. We can start by defending Columbia University. If we fail to do so, we will fail higher education and also the entire country.",

        "title": "Democratic voters’ attitudes on partisan compromise undergo a dramatic shift",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "While the topline takeaways in the latest NBC News poll related to Donald Trump and his weakening public standing, there were some revelations related to Democratic voters’ attitudes that were every bit as interesting, if not more so. From the network’s analysis:\n\nBack in April 2017, 59% of Democrats said they wanted congressional Democrats to make compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation, with 33% saying they should stick to their positions even if that means not being able to get things done in Washington. Now, that sentiment has completely flipped. Almost two-thirds of Democrats, 65%, say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if that risks sacrificing bipartisan progress, and just 32% want them to make legislative compromises with Trump.\n\nThe shift from 2017 to 2025 is certainly notable, given the relevant parallels: It compares the beginning of the president’s first term with the beginning of his second.\n\nBut there’s also value in looking back even further. I wrote an item for the Washington Monthly about this way back in 2011, noting an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll that reflected striking partisan asymmetry: At the time, in the wake of the 2010 midterm elections, more than two-thirds of Democratic voters (68%) said they expected their party’s leaders to make compromises as part of a broader effort to gain consensus. The same data found a majority of Republican voters (56%) arguing that GOP leaders should stick to their guns and avoid compromise, no matter the consequences.\n\nA week earlier, a Pew Research Center survey pointed in a nearly identical direction: Most Democratic voters said Democratic officials should focus on compromise, while most Republican voters wanted GOP officials to stand on principle. A Gallup poll taken around the same time found very similar results.\n\nThe disconnect between the parties was extraordinary, and it endured for quite a while. For over a decade, Democratic voters embraced a compromise-based approach because it appeared unavoidable: In a complex, Madisonian style of government, filled with choke points and pitfalls, give-and-take is baked into the system. It seemed wholly unrealistic to think any one party or faction would get everything it wanted, so rank-and-file Democrats naturally understood that concessions and negotiations would be part of any responsible approach to governing.\n\nThe Democratic base not only endorsed compromise as part of a mature policymaking model, those same voters also expected it.\n\nMost Republican voters fundamentally rejected such a posture, insisting that those who compromised were guilty of weakness and betrayals.\n\nNot surprisingly, the parties’ elected officials internalized these attitudes. It became the norm for Democratic officials — in the White House and on Capitol Hill — to strive for bipartisan agreements, while GOP officials equated bipartisan dealmaking with defeat.\n\nIn time, not surprisingly, Democrats noticed that they weren’t getting many RSVPs to the compromise parties they threw. Republicans slapped away outstretched hands. Olive branches were treated like poison ivy. GOP officials even abandoned some of their own ideas and priorities the moments Democrats endorsed them.\n\nIn other words, there’s no great mystery as to why, exactly, the Democratic base has shifted so dramatically in its approach to bipartisan negotiation and cooperation.\n\nTo be sure, it’s a multifaceted dynamic. The increasing radicalization of Republican politics necessarily repulses much of the Democratic mainstream, making compromise effectively impossible. Relatedly, given the degree to which the incumbent GOP president appears indifferent to bipartisan governing and reality, it’s not too surprising to see so many Democratic voters reject the idea of trying to work with him in good faith in pursuit of common ground.\n\nBut at the heart of the debate, there’s an inescapable realization: Democratic voters were on board with compromises until they grew tired of being alone. Now, according to the data, they’re ready for something different — thanks entirely to the conditions that Republicans themselves created.\n\nThe question for party leaders is whether Democratic policymakers are ready to reassess years’ worth of assumptions and adapt to their base’s new set of expectations.",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer was right to avoid a government shutdown",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "With the threat of a government shutdown averted after the Senate passed a government funding bill Friday, Washington and the nation can breathe a sigh of relief. But in the aftermath, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is the object of angry Democrats in Congress and across the country who wanted a fight with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. As a former senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am a veteran of numerous government-funding fights. I know what causes shutdowns and the difficulty of reopening the government after a shutdown. Schumer faced an incredibly difficult predicament and he was right to support keeping the government open.\n\nLet’s start with the basics. Since the start of the fiscal year in October, the federal government has been operating on a continuing resolution, which means the government was being funded (with limited exceptions) at levels set the previous fiscal year. The bill enacted on Friday extends funding through September, the end of the fiscal year. It funds the government largely at current levels, although defense spending is slightly increased while domestic spending is a slightly decreased.\n\nWhile a year-long CR is a terrible way to run the federal government, it is better than a government shutdown.\n\nThere is a word to describe governing by CR: failure. CRs represent Congress’ failure to do its most fundamental task: responsibly fund the government. The executive branch, especially the Pentagon, have real difficulty operating under CR’s. Some funding accounts will be depleted and in need of replenishment; others will be too flush and in need of reduction. It is very difficult for the executive branch to move monies between accounts without congressional sign-off — not that this fact will discourage the Trump administration from trying.\n\nBut while a yearlong CR is a terrible way to run the federal government, it is better than a government shutdown. Schumer is being pummeled for his decision by his angry Democratic base for not fighting the CR, but he understood things could get much worse for federal employees and congressional Democrats during a shutdown. Trump would be empowered to determine which federal employees were essential or nonessential. Trump surely would have designated as many federal employees as possible nonessential and furlough them. The so-called Department of Government Efficiency would run wild, putting even more employees at risk of permanent dismissal. Recalling all those furloughed nonessential employees would have been enormously challenging.\n\nAs for Democrats’ political struggles against the Trump administration, a shutdown would have redirected the focus away from the economy, Trump’s destructive tariffs, appeasement of Russia and betrayal of Ukraine, and Elon Musk’s chainsaw and wood chipper approach to reducing the federal workforce. Furthermore, the party making the policy demand is blamed for a shutdown. Republicans were blamed in 2013 and 2018-19 shutdowns for wanting to defund Obamacare and immigration demands, respectively. That’s because demanding policy concessions to keep the government open is not a winning argument. It’s the equivalent of a small child holding his breath and waiting for everyone else to turn blue. It doesn’t work.\n\nFurthermore, Schumer was likely honoring the wishes of members who wanted him to save them from themselves. Punchbowl reported Monday that “based on our conversations with Democratic senators, many more Senate Democrats than just the nine who voted with Schumer agreed with his ultimate decision.” This is a familiar strategy in Washington, known as “vote no, hope yes.” Leadership can be a lonely job when tough decisions like this one are required. After all, a leader with no followers is just a guy taking a walk.\n\nTo be clear, Schumer’s handling of this situation was not perfect. First, if he intended to fold, he should have done so sooner and not raised expectations of fighting the House-passed GOP funding bill. Second, congressional Democrats failed to articulate clearly what they even wanted in the bill, which muddled their message. Third, Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries were not coordinated in their negotiating strategy with congressional Republicans.\n\nBut had Schumer chosen to fight, Democrats would likely have shouldered at least part of, if not most, of the blame for what could have been a protracted, painful shutdown. The bottom line is Senate Democrats were in a terrible, no-win position. The choice was to fight and shut down the government, or fold and find better ground for another day. Schumer, smartly but painfully, chose the latter. He made the right choice and took one for the team.",

        "title": "Who is Gavin Newsom's podcast for?",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has a new podcast called “This Is Gavin Newsom.” Many Democrats are not going to be happy about it, because thus far all it shows is that Newsom is not who we thought he was.\n\nAs Newsom put it, the show’s premise is talking to “people I disagree with, people I look up to.” Over the first few episodes, the governor’s chat partners have only been far-right activists and commentators, so one would expect them to fall in the first category. Yet Newsom is so deferential to his guests — even when they spread noxious right-wing propaganda — that sometimes they seem to fit more clearly in the latter category.\n\nIt's not clear if Newsom has a clear command of his new project.\n\nNewsom is widely considered a serious contender for the 2028 Democratic nomination, and his decision to start a podcast and invite big-name right-wingers — like former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk — seems like an obvious attention grab. But it’s not clear if Newsom has a clear command of his new project, or whether the attention he seeks could backfire on him.\n\nThe first episode featured Newsom telling Kirk that his son is a fan of the MAGA activist. Newsom also agreed with or praised Kirk scores of times — so much, in fact, that Kirk later said “Gov. Newsom was being overly effusive in his praise of me.” Listening to the Democrat — who as mayor of San Francisco two decades ago was at the vanguard of the gay rights movement — gush with warmth and admiration for a far-right commentator who has promoted the racist “great replacement theory,” called for completely banning gender-affirming care for trans people and described trans people as “disgusting, mentally ill, neurotic, predatory freaks” was jarring and disheartening.\n\nIn the headline-generating moment of the interview, Newsom said it was “deeply unfair” to allow transgender women and girls to compete in female sports. He also objected to “woke culture,” saying nobody in his office ever used the term “Latinx” — even though he has used the term himself in the past multiple times. The conversation seemed to signal that Newsom is moving to the right of the Democratic Party establishment on a number of culture war issues.\n\nNewsom’s newly revealed positions represent the strain of thinking in some Democratic circles that the party should retreat from less popular policy positions and linguistic norms tied to progressive inclusivity in order to appeal to a wider base. Recent polls from YouGov and The New York Times/Ipsos have found that a sizable majority of Americans believe trans women should not be able to participate in women’s sports. And some data shows that the term Latinx, which is an attempt to make the term “Latino” more gender neutral, can drive Latino voters away from Democrats.\n\nIt is theoretically possible that shifting on the issue of trans women in sports could make Democrats more appealing to the general electorate. But there’s also reason to be skeptical. Vice President Kamala Harris kept trans issues at a distance during her 2024 White House bid, but she was still defined by the right over her earlier positions. And survey data and studies consistently showed trans issues were never a top-tier issue for voters in the election and had little to no effect on voter choice.\n\nIn other words, it’s possible that Newsom — who until this podcast had been considered an exceptional LGBTQ ally — is signaling a distance from the trans community that would never endear him to people on the right. The pivot is likely to come off as insincere to many, in part because the binary between Democrats and Republicans on trans rights is so stark that Democratic moderation will go unrewarded.\n\nThe other issue for Newsom is that if he were ever to run for president, he’d have to get through the primary electorate first. And it’s clear that Newsom has immediately sparked a backlash online from many progressives who think his pivot is expedient and marks an abandonment of the trans community. Every presidential hopeful has to watch both their right and their left flank — and navigate those challenges without being branded a total phony.\n\nNewsom’s conversation with Bannon was also packed with deference and praise for one of the most influential architects of the Trump era. Newsom allowed Bannon to casually lie about the 2020 election without pushback, and to define right-wing populism as “anti-elitist” without any substantive objection about Trump’s billionaire-friendly presidency. Newsom also chuckled as Bannon implied that the legal cases against Trump were purely political. Given the tone of the rest of the conversation, the laugh came off as sympathetic rather than a recognition of absurdity.\n\nIt wasn’t a debate or a dialogue; on everything from DOGE to tariffs, Bannon ran the table and Newsom mostly nodded along. To be sure, on occasion Newsom pushed back on issues like trade, but those were the exceptions proving the rule, and the overall effect was to normalize the rest of Bannon’s noxious misinformation and right-wing theories of society — which went unchallenged.\n\nIt’s hard to tell if Newsom knows what he’s doing or how he’s coming across. Politicians like former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., know how to talk in a persuasive and respectful tone to conservative audiences while maintaining their adherence to liberal and social democratic values, respectively.\n\nNewsom, by contrast, comes off in these podcast episodes like a dupe and a pushover to progressives, and it’s doubtful that his acquiescent posture will translate to votes from across the aisle. Even on the level of pure political education, Newsom’s project is irresponsible. He’s effectively sane-washing lots of right-wing talking points that demand more serious engagement than he’s demonstrated he’s capable of providing, and he is not advancing arguments about how folks on the right should see it in their interest to reconsider the left.\n\nIt begs the question: Who is “This Is Gavin Newsom” for?",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this month, a collection of people and entities affiliated with President Donald Trump — specifically, the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, DJT Holdings LLC, DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC, DTTM Operations LLC and Eric Trump — sued Capital One bank for having “unjustifiably” closed numerous Trump-associated bank accounts in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe lawsuit pleads that “de-banking” — closing depositors’ bank accounts — was originally meant to stop fraudsters from having access to banking facilities but it morphed into a way to punish depositors for their political beliefs. The lawsuit explains that completely legal gun and ammunition dealers or payday lenders often found themselves de-banked by unelected bureaucrats who disagreed with the businesses’ political beliefs. The plaintiffs claim to have been damaged by this type of de-banking when Capital One closed Trump accounts because of the Trumps’ “political views.” The Trumps seek damages under an assortment of state consumer protection laws.\n\nJust how many ways is this lawsuit silly? Let me count them.\n\nAs a purely legal matter, the Trumps don’t appear to have suffered any recoverable money damages. According to the lawsuit, Capital One closed the Trump bank accounts. Presumably, the bank returned the Trumps’ money to them — the lawsuit doesn’t say otherwise, and it’s inconceivable the bank would have stolen the Trumps’ money. (A representative for Capital One declined to comment for this article.)\n\nIt’s true that individual depositors with small accounts — such as gun shops — might have trouble setting up new banking relationships after they were “de-banked,” but a large real estate business, such as the Trump Organization, would have had no trouble on that score. So while we don’t know for certain, the Trumps’ situation was presumably this: Capital One closed the Trumps’ bank accounts, Capital One returned the Trumps’ money, the Trumps promptly found a new bank, and the Trumps, uninjured, went on with their business.\n\nA fundamental element of any lawsuit is that a plaintiff must have suffered damages. Here, except perhaps for the inconvenience of changing bankers, the Trumps suffered none.\n\nWhere’s the case?\n\nBut that’s just the legal flaw in this lawsuit. Think for a moment about the practical flaws.\n\nJust how many ways is this lawsuit silly? Let me count them.\n\nIs any jury going to believe that Capital One stopped its banking relationship in the months after Jan. 6 because of Donald Trump’s political beliefs? Did the bank really think, “Donald Trump doesn’t like affirmative action and he opposes DEI, so we should close his accounts”?\n\nOr is it far more likely — and in fact almost certainly true, and sure to be believed by a jury in a heartbeat — that Capital One closed the Trumps’ bank accounts because it didn’t care to be associated with a person who appeared to have incited an insurrection and then stood by silently for three hours as rioters ransacked the Capitol?\n\nJust about everyone in America — all Democrats, and even some Republicans — knew that Trump was “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events” of Jan. 6, as then-GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell put it at the time.\n\nThis wasn’t a matter of politics; it was a matter of morality.\n\nCapital One didn’t close the Trumps’ bank accounts because of Trump’s political views. Capital One has denied that it closed the bank accounts for political reasons, but it wouldn’t be unreasonable to surmise that the bank didn’t care to be associated with anyone — Democratic, Republican or independent — who tried to interfere with the counting of votes in a presidential election. Handling financial transactions for Trump both would have been immoral and would have posed a reputational risk for the bank. Ending that relationship wasn’t improper; it was sane.\n\nAlthough many Americans seem to have forgiven Trump’s gross misconduct over the four years since the Jan. 6 riot, that misconduct could fully justify Capital One’s closing of the bank accounts.\n\nBut the practical flaws in the Trumps’ lawsuit don’t stop there.\n\nIn any lawsuit, the parties are permitted to take discovery — gather information — from each other. Capital One will thus have the right to request documents and take testimony from Donald Trump and others about Trump’s conduct on Jan. 6. As the House Jan. 6 committee proceedings made clear, there is nothing about Trump’s conduct in early January 2021 that is praiseworthy; there is much that should be condemned. Does Trump really want to relive, and again place in the public eye, the events of one of the most notorious days in his life?\n\nThere are many reasons for the Trumps to abandon this lawsuit. There is only one reason for them to pursue it: to get a financial settlement.\n\nThere’s no legal reason for Capital One to settle the Trumps’ newest lawsuit. The lawsuit is both defensible and embarrassing for Trump to pursue. But there are surely practical reasons — avoiding the wrath the federal government could inflict on a bank — for Capital One to cough up some dough to make this go away.\n\nIs that justice? Not by a long shot.\n\nBut does it appear to be a recurring way for Trump to profit while he has the government on his side? Bank on it.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Bill Burr talks a whole lot about men in his new comedy special “Drop Dead Years,” which debuted on Hulu on Friday. Why is it, he wonders aloud, that only men “drop dead,” usually between the ages of 49 and 61, sometimes while manscaping “in the upstairs bathroom while listening to AC/DC”? How come “men aren’t allowed to be sad”? “We’re allowed,” he continues, “to be one of two things: mad or ‘fine.’ That’s it.” If you want to see sad men doing sad things in their natural sad habitat, Burr suggests, visit your local Guitar Center.\n\nBurr is also thinking about men in much more personal terms. “Drop Dead Years” opens up with the comedian, offstage, reflecting candidly:\n\nIt’s kind of a weird thing to be over 50 and realize how f----d up you are. Like, I thought I did stand-up because I loved comedy. And then what I really figured out is that, no, that’s not why I did it. I did stand-up because that was the easiest way to walk into a room full of a bunch of people that I didn’t know and make everybody like me. All of the way I’ve moved through the world has always been like, ‘Where’s the place I have the least chance of being hurt?’\n\nBill Burr is a therapeutic work in progress. He’s bravely figuring himself out ... in public. The process, however, is not free of contradictions. Nor is it going very smoothly.\n\nIn “Drop Dead Years,” as in previous specials, he copiously mocks women, feminists, gays, liberals, trans people, overweight people, etc. And while the results are often very funny, this sure is an odd way to get “everybody” in the room to like him.\n\nThe response to his controversial “Saturday Night Live” monologue of 2020, in which he lit up “cancel culture,” is a case in point. As is his postelection 2024 “SNL” appearance, when he counseled women not to wear pantsuits like Kamala Harris did. Instead, the ladies who seek elected office should “whore it up a bit.”\n\nWhat truly separates Burr from the manosphere bros is that he appears to be making an earnest attempt at introspection.\n\nIt’s tempting to situate a comedian like Burr in the present comedic “manosphere.” That would be the dank man cave where Joe Rogan, Tony Hinchcliffe, Theo Von and others trash liberal pieties, garner immense crowds and earn success and influence in the process. Like them, Burr’s got the stage rage. He’s got the confrontational “I’m so mad my heart is about to explode!” affect. He too delights in (rhetorically) coldcocking minorities.\n\nBut Burr is different. He’s not only older than these boys, he is infinitely more intelligent. A heady gag in “Drop Dead Years” about KKK members riding in the HOV lane reminds us that Burr is a thinking man’s comic in the style of George Carlin. He’s also an exceptionally skilled physical actor. He uses his body, pasty white face and bald dome (which shines like a diamond under the stage lights) in ways that few can rival: I especially appreciated his imitation of a man dropping dead out of a golf cart.\n\nAnd then there’s what we might call Burr’s balance. He’s not averse to punching up. In an interview with NPR’s Terry Gross this past week, the comic set his sights on Elon Musk. “I just refuse to believe,” Burr declared, reflecting on the billionaire’s Inauguration Day salutes, “that it was an accidental, two-time ‘Sieg heil.’”\n\nYet what truly separates Burr from the manosphere bros is that he appears to be making an earnest attempt at introspection. As the opening comments in this latest special suggest, Burr is doing the work, limning the pain, trying to be a better husband and dad. He’s boldly marching into the aforementioned room — a “room,” I might add, that streams to a few million people — and bleeding out.\n\nBurr’s asking questions. Why can’t men wrap themselves in an afghan, sit in a corner and brood like women can? Why can’t men be sad? The problem is that, like Dave Chappelle, he also demands to know why he can’t use a homophobic slur anymore.\n\nHis public therapeutic turn, with all of its contradictions, is equally evident in the NPR interview with Gross. One second he’s decimating Musk’s “laminated face” and the next (like, literally one second later), he’s talking about why he hates liberals. One second he’s confronting his flawed masculinity; moments later, he’s subjecting Gross to the type of off-the-shelf manosphere rebuttals that are guaranteed to drive liberal women, among others, to distraction. (The normally serene Gross, for her part, at some points low-key loses her patience with Burr’s evasions and interruptions.)\n\nBurr is doing the work, limning the pain, trying to be a better husband and dad.\n\nBill Burr is extremely funny. But politically, the man is completely incomprehensible.\n\nIn terms of psychic self-awareness, I don’t think he’s quite “there” yet (wherever that may be). Admirably, he’s realized that he performs his comedy to avoid getting hurt. It therefore boggles the mind that he seems to make no effort to interrogate whether and how his jokes, broadcast to multitudes, might hurt other people, whether that’s gay men, or women bemoaning Harris’ election loss (and their personal freedoms).\n\nThe closing sequence of “Drop Dead Years” provides a clue as to how Burr may presently resolve all this psychic tumult. A few moments earlier, he had mentioned that he was touched inappropriately as a child (“I got touched as a kid”). Now the credits have rolled, we’re in the alley behind the theater. Away from the crowd. Everything’s quiet. Burr is sitting on the stoop of the stage door. His buddy is eating a sandwich and drinking a beer. Burr is smoking a cigar. It’s a good cigar. Maybe, the moment suggests, men achieve psychic resolution by being alone with other men.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "We start the week with a question that has arisen in multiple cases just a couple of months in to Donald Trump’s second term: Did his administration violate a court order?\n\nThe latest iteration of the question comes in litigation that developed quickly over the weekend, after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport people who the administration said are members of a transnational gang called Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union sued, and on Saturday, the chief federal trial judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the government not to remove people pursuant to Trump’s proclamation. The government is appealing Judge James Boasberg’s temporary restraining orders, and litigation will proceed in the D.C. federal appeals court this week as the Trump administration seeks to upend them.\n\nBut in the meantime, the ACLU told Boasberg in a court filing early Monday that “media reports and publicly available data” suggest that the government defendants “may have violated the Court’s Orders.” The plaintiffs asked the judge to “seek immediate clarification from Defendants, in one or more sworn declarations, about their conduct regarding this Court’s Orders.”\n\nThe plaintiffs noted that Boasberg had told the government to turn around any planes carrying people pursuant to the proclamation, and they questioned the government’s compliance with that mandate, suggesting that officials had played fast and loose with the judge’s directives. To get to the bottom of the matter, the plaintiffs want sworn declarations from the government on the following points:\n\n1) whether any flight with individuals subject to the Proclamation took off after either the Court’s written or oral Orders were issued; 2) whether any flight with individuals subject to the Proclamation landed after either the Court’s written or oral Orders were issued; 3) whether any flight with individuals subject to the Proclamation was still in the air after either the Court’s written or oral Orders were issued; and 4) whether custody of any individuals subject to the Proclamation was transferred to a foreign country after either the Court’s written or oral Orders were issued.\n\nTo be sure, this is not the first case in which opposing parties have questioned the nascent administration’s legal compliance. To take another example in pending litigation, the plaintiffs in the foreign aid funding case that was at the Supreme Court and is back in the trial court are still casting doubt on Trump officials’ compliance there.\n\nAs for this latest situation involving flights over the weekend, we could learn soon whether Boasberg himself thinks the government defied his orders. On Monday morning, after the ACLU submitted its filing, he ordered a same-day 5 p.m. ET hearing at which the government “shall be prepared to provide answers” to the questions raised by the plaintiffs.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "title": "Trump scraps key Biden-era policy that increased minimum wage for federal contractors",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Republican leaders understand that the GOP has earned a reputation for championing the interests of the wealthy, but they occasionally make the case that the party has changed.\n\nAround this time four years ago, for example, then-House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy declared, “The uniqueness of this party today is we’re the workers party.” Around the same time, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas wrote online, “The Republican Party is not the party of the country clubs, it’s the party of hardworking, blue-collar men and women.”\n\nIt’s difficult to say with confidence whether GOP leaders ever believed their own rhetoric when it came to workers’ interests, but Donald Trump continues to take steps that leave little doubt that the contemporary Republican Party is most certainly not “the workers party.” Bloomberg Law reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump scrapped Biden-era executive orders that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 and drove federal infrastructure investments toward companies that agree to union neutrality. ... In addition to union neutrality, the now canceled EO 14126 favored companies that offer equitable compensation practices and participate in registered apprenticeships.\n\nIn case anyone needs a refresher, it was in early 2014 when Barack Obama raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour. As we discussed at the time, because government contracts can be lucrative, and so many private enterprises want federal work, the Democratic president, with a stroke of a pen, gave a raise to a whole lot of employees. The shift also sent a message to the private sector that to compete in the labor force, businesses should follow suit.\n\nRepublicans were less than pleased but faced a messaging challenge: Since most Americans support a higher minimum wage, the GOP didn’t want to be seen attacking the Democrat for doing something popular. As an alternative, Republicans pretended to be outraged that Obama advanced one of his goals by way of an executive order.\n\nRepublican Rep. Randy Weber of Texas, for example, called Obama a “Socialistic dictator” and the “Kommandant-In-Chef.” (I assume he meant “chief.”) Then-House Speaker John Boehner suggested the minimum-wage hike for contractors was unconstitutional. Ted Cruz was so incensed that he wrote an op-ed condemning the “imperial presidency of Barack Obama.”\n\nUndeterred, Biden built on the policy in 2021, raising the wage for federal contractors to $15, amid a series of related efforts to use White House power to encourage corporations that do business with the government to adopt pro-labor policies.\n\nTrump has now used his power to undo all of these Biden-era steps.\n\nThe president’s move comes four months after he appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the “Press” and faced a question about the federal minimum wage. Host Kristen Welker reminded the Republican that the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 for more than 15 years and asked whether he was prepared to raise it.\n\n“It’s a very low number,” Trump conceded, referring to the status quo. “I will agree, it’s a very low number.”\n\nAs the exchange continued, however, Trump, who has spent years offering confusing and contradictory positions on the issue, declared that he believes having a federal minimum wage doesn’t “work.”\n\nEvidently, he apparently believes raising the minimum wage for federal contractors doesn’t work, either.",

        "title": "What is an autopen, the device at the center of Trump’s attack on Biden’s pardons?",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 17 episode of \"José Díaz-Balart Reports.\"\n\nEarly Monday morning in a post on his social media site, President Donald Trump claimed Joe Biden’s pardons for members of the House Jan. 6 committee are invalid due to the former president’s use of an autopen:\n\nThe “Pardons” that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\n\nBefore I was a lawyer, I was a congressional aide, so I’ve used an autopen before. It’s essentially a machine set up to mimic someone’s signature exactly. It’s often used when an office holder, or someone else, has to sign so many documents that it would be impracticable for them to do so by hand.\n\nIn 2005, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department — which basically serves as the “Mother, may I?” division of the agency — clarified a president’s use of an autopen, issuing an opinion that it was within the executive's constitutional powers to sign a bill via an autopen, at their own direction.\n\n“We emphasize that we are not suggesting that the President may delegate the decision to approve and sign a bill, only that, having made this decision, he may direct a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to the bill,” the opinion states.\n\nBy extension, a president should also be able to direct that a pardon be issued under an autopen. There should be no distinction between a president’s powers to sign and authorize a piece of legislation and their pardon power. I would also argue that a president’s power with respect to pardons is actually greater than their role in signing a piece of legislation. So if it’s constitutionally valid for a president to sign a piece of legislation by autopen, there should be no impediment to them doing so with a pardon.\n\nIf it’s constitutionally valid for a president to sign a piece of legislation by autopen, there should be no impediment to them doing so with a pardon.\n\nIn that same post, Trump also claimed, without evidence, that Biden “did not know anything” about these pardons. While the Constitution does not allow a president to revoke a pardon, it appears Trump may direct his Justice Department to carry out an investigation into this matter. That means if you're one of these pardon recipients, the question now becomes: How do you prove that the then-president directed the use of an autopen to sign your pardon? The onus will fall on those who have received pardons to prove that their pardon is legitimate. That’s where this is likely headed next.",

        "content": "From using the White House’s South Lawn to shill cars for his biggest campaign donor to demanding taxpayer-funded ads that claim he victoriously closed the southern border, President Donald Trump is demonstrating that, as he stated in his first term, he has “the right to do whatever I want.” That’s his twisted interpretation of Article 2 of the Constitution, which describes the power of the president.\n\nThe president of the United States is not a king. He’s not a monarch ordained by a god.\n\nYet the president of the United States is not a king. He’s not a monarch ordained by a god. As former President Barack Obama said in a “60 Minutes” interview in November 2020, the “president is a public servant.” The person elected to that office should represent and serve the public’s best interest — not his own.\n\nAs mass protests against the Trump administration take place across the nation, let us remember the historical role and responsibility of the president and what others who’ve held the office have had to say about the responsibility that comes with the position. “The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants,” former President Teddy Roosevelt wrote in a May 1918 editorial in The Kansas City Star. In 1954, former President Harry Truman said, “I would much rather be an honorable public servant and known as such than to be the richest man in the world.”\n\nThe president is supposed to serve us, the American people. Not just the people who voted for him or who donated to his campaign or inauguration — but all the people. Toward that end and in keeping with America’s long-standing policies, Trump should be working to preserve and strengthen our democratic society and democracies around the world — not undermining them by playing nice with dictators.\n\nThe American people elected Trump and have entrusted him to serve their bests interests. “Public service is a public trust,” reads Executive Order 12674 from 1989, spelling out one of the primary principles of ethical conduct for government officers and employees. President Thomas Jefferson even asserted, “When a man assumes a public trust, he should consider himself as public property.”\n\nYou just have to laugh at the idea of Trump — who wants to privatize public services from the U.S. Postal Service to education and even sell off public lands to private interests — ever considering himself public property. The absolute, fiendishly calculated chaos he has unfurled in the first weeks of his second term proves that serving the public’s best interest was never a part of his — or, let’s be honest, Project 2025’s — agenda. In that way, Trump, who has always loved flaunting his wealth, is the opposite of Truman.\n\nIn that 1918 editorial, Roosevelt asserted it was as important that the public “blame [the president] when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right … in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the nation as a whole.”\n\nThe problem is that Trump and his supporters don’t always appear to be committed to codes of ethical conduct or the law. And Trump has shown over the course of his career that he doesn’t take accountability for his actions. “Deny everything” is one of the lessons he learned from his lawyer and mentor Roy Cohn. Trump has decimated independent federal agencies likely because they are units of accountability — specifically in terms of offering oversight and regulation — in our government system of “checks and balances.”\n\nTrump has shown over the course of his career that he doesn’t take accountability for his actions.\n\nNotably, Roosevelt’s words about the president being the most important public servant were not directed to then-President Woodrow Wilson but to his fellow Americans to encourage them “to tell the truth about [the president’s] acts. … Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.”\n\nIn other words, we, the American people, are responsible to each other to secure the health of our democracy. This means we must elect to office presidents who are committed to public service, and if we fail at that, then we must use our First Amendment rights to protest against them.\n\nThey’re there to serve us, not the other way around.",

        "content": "Democrats seem to have been outplayed by Republicans when it comes to managing the latest government shutdown battle. And perhaps their biggest mistake was underestimating House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. By a 54-46 vote on Friday night, the Senate approved the funding bill to keep the government open that the Republican-controlled House had passed on Tuesday.\n\nAs bad as passing the continuing resolution would be, I believe a government shutdown is far worse. Senate minority leader chuck schumer\n\nThis shutdown cycle was not without drama. On Thursday, the evening before the deadline, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reversed the position he’d taken earlier in the week and vowed to help pass the House’s short-term continuing resolution bill. This must have been a tough call for the New York Democrat. As Schumer wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times, “As bad as passing the continuing resolution would be, I believe a government shutdown is far worse.”\n\nAnd while Schumer did not ultimately vote yes on the bill itself, his advocacy and yes vote on the cloture motion likely secured Friday night’s outcome.\n\nOn Friday morning at least, the Democrats were torn into two camps: fight Trump tooth and nail, which would lead to a shutdown and the potential chaos and pain that would bring, or swallow a partisan CR and at least keep the lights on. There were also specific fears that a shutdown would allow President Donald Trump and Elon Musk to accelerate some of their most aggressive agenda items, including mass federal layoffs and governmental reorganizing. “Musk has already said he wants a shutdown, and public reporting has shown he is already making plans to expedite his destruction of key government programs and services,” said Schumer from the Senate floor on Thursday.\n\nSchumer calculated ultimately the Democrats would be blamed for the impact on “the most vulnerable Americans, those who rely on federal programs to feed their families, get medical care and stay financially afloat. Communities that depend on government services to function will suffer.”\n\nHowever, in many ways, the die had already been cast. On Tuesday night, Johnson passed the spending bill with nearly unanimous GOP support. And then promptly sent his members home.\n\nThe speaker certainly had some help from both the president and White House officials. Trump himself was working the phones, while Vice President JD Vance reportedly “assured Republican members that Trump would continue cutting federal funding with his Department of Government Efficiency initiative and pursue impoundment — that is, holding back money appropriated by Congress.”\n\nJohnson is often thought of as the accidental speaker. And it’s true that he was pulled out of quasi-obscurity after the caucus took down his predecessor Kevin McCarthy just 17 months ago. At the time of his elevation, Johnson had no leadership experience, and the political class had very low expectations. But he had Trump in his corner.\n\n(Trump did blow up a bill in December carefully negotiated by Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. But Johnson eventually prevailed, with Democratic votes, and a spending bill was passed.)\n\nLast December's funding bill was always a temporary stopgap measure that would only fund the federal government through March 13, 2025. More surprising was that Johnson was able to get the House to pass its budget outline last month, with only losing a single vote. This should have served as a canary in the coal mine moment for Democrats.\n\nThe real blunder Schumer made was miscalculating just how good Johnson has become at playing political hardball. The thought of Johnson passing a six-month continuing resolution with just Republican votes seemed highly unlikely last year, and that was what both Jeffries and Schumer were counting on. They were operating on the premise that, just like with the last CR, Republicans were going to need Democratic votes to get the bill to the president’s desk, leaving room for negotiations.\n\nJohnson defied the odds and passed the CR, losing just one Republican vote, and picking up an extra yes vote from Maine Democrat Jared Golden. That left Schumer floundering, and with only one option to keep the government open.\n\nThere is a lesson to be learned here, and now would be a good time for Democratic leadership — as well as Senate Majority Leader John Thune — to recognize Johnson’s skills. They don’t have to like him or agree with him, but going forward they should respect him, and maybe even fear him.",

        "content": "The latest national NBC News poll asked American voters which country has their sympathies in the Russian/Ukrainian war, and the results weren’t close: Only 2% of Americans sided with Vladmir Putin’s regime, while 61% chose U.S. allies Kyiv. The same poll, however, asked about Donald Trump’s sympathies, and a 49% plurality said they believe the Republican president is sympathetic to Moscow.\n\nDemocratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey along with a GOP colleague, said, “I cannot recall a moment in history when American public opinion and voters’ views of a president, as to which country they are more aligned with, have been more in conflict with each other.”\n\nThere is no reason to see the poll as an outlier. The latest national survey from Quinnipiac University found that a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the war and believe he hasn’t been tough enough on Putin. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll also found that more than half of Americans agreed that the president is “too closely aligned” with Russia. Similarly, the latest CNN poll found that a majority of Americans disapprove of the Republican’s policies toward Russia and Ukraine, and 50% said his approach to the war is bad for the United States. (For more information on the polls’ methodologies and margins of error, click on any of the above links.)\n\nWith data like this, it’s tempting to think the American president, who’s been a little too eager of late to align his administration with Moscow, might consider a change in direction. He’s not. On the contrary, Trump continues to double and triple down on his unpopular approach.\n\nDuring his unhinged remarks at the Justice Department late last week, for example, the president falsely suggested that Ukraine tried to “pick on” Russia. The next day, for reasons that weren’t altogether clear, Trump published a 150-word item to his social media platform, insisting that Putin was punctual for his meeting with “my Highly Respected Ambassador and Special Envoy, Steve Witkoff” — who is not actually an ambassador.\n\nAround the same time, NBC News published this striking report:\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia was excluded from high-level talks on ending the war after the Kremlin said it didn’t want him there, a U.S. administration official and a Russian official told NBC News. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg was conspicuously absent from two recent summits in Saudi Arabia — one with Russian officials and the other with Ukrainians — even though the talks come under his remit.\n\nDuring the presidential transition process, Trump announced that the retired general would oversee the administration’s policy toward the war, but the NBC News report, published late last week, said Moscow made it clear behind the scenes that it did not approve of Kellogg.\n\nThe next day, Trump announced that Kellogg would now have a new job, serving as his special envoy to Ukraine. It led reporter Laura Rozen to note that it “looks like Trump let Russia veto one of his negotiators.”\n\nIn case that weren’t quite enough, as this week got underway, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration has informed our longtime European allies that the United States is withdrawing from the International Center for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine — a “multinational group created to investigate leaders responsible for the invasion of Ukraine.”\n\nThe Trump administration “is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declared two weeks ago. “This largely aligns with our vision.”\n\nThe latest polling suggests this is not what the American mainstream wants. The American president doesn’t seem to care.",

        "title": "The White House escalates its radical offensive against D.C. law firms",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "A few weeks ago, Donald Trump and his White House team took an unprecedented step, punishing a prominent private law firm, Covington & Burling LLP, because it assisted with former special counsel Jack Smith’s investigations. The New York Times described the move as “a breathtaking escalation.”\n\nA week later, the Republican president did it again, punishing Perkins Coie, a large international law firm with some prominent Democratic clients.\n\nThe tactics did not go unnoticed. Indeed, when Perkins Coie filed suit, challenging the legality of Trump’s order, U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell temporarily blocked the president’s policy, saying in reference to the executive order, “It sends little chills down my spine.” The judge added, “I am sure that many in the profession are watching in horror at what Perkins Coie is going through.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a constitutional scholar, had a similar reaction, describing the White House’s offensive as “dangerous as hell.”\n\nThe president didn’t appear to care. In fact, in an interview that was aired early last week, the Republican told Fox News that there were other law firms that he also intended to target. Evidently, he was serious. The New York Times reported:\n\nPresident Trump on Friday opened a third attack against a private law firm, restricting the business activities of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison just days after a federal judge ruled such measures appeared to violate the Constitution.\n\nAccording to the order, the move was motivated partly because the firm employs Mark Pomerantz, who assembled evidence against Trump years ago while working at the Manhattan district attorney’s office, and partly because a partner at the firm worked on a case involving a Jan. 6 rioter.\n\nA Politico report noted, “Top law firms are debating whether to make a public show of support for three major firms that have come under attack by the Trump administration. ... But they’re racked by private worries they’d be targeted, too.”\n\nIn other words, the president is already retaliating against some of the largest law firms in Washington, D.C. Other firms could step up and denounce such tactics, but they know they’d likely end up soon after on the West Wing’s retaliation list.\n\nBut while it’s very easy to believe this campaign reflects Trump’s larger drive to turn his second term into an extended revenge tour, there’s another element to this that’s worth keeping in mind.\n\nRight now, with Congress’ Republican majorities in the House and Senate acting like presidential employees, the most meaningful barrier between Trump and his goals is the judiciary — an institution where he and his policies have struggled quite a bit over the last several weeks.\n\nWith this in mind, the rationale behind the offensive against law firms becomes even more obvious: The White House likely wants to stop losing in the courts, and the surest way to prevent those defeats is to discourage nervous law firms from taking cases that Trump won’t like.",

        "title": "New poll suggests Democratic voters are livid at party leaders. That's a good thing.",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was supposed to be touring the country this week, signing and selling copies of his new book. Instead, the New York senator postponed the whole tour over “security concerns.” More specifically, the concern was that liberal activists, angry at his decision to acquiesce to Republicans’ recent government funding bill, were planning large protests at every event.\n\nIt’s undoubtedly embarrassing for Democrats that their leader in the Senate is ducking scenes of being called a coward by voters in his own party. But that the very fact that the party’s base is so livid at its leadership could be good news. Recent history tells us that that anger may be crucial if the Democrats are to back from their current lowly position.\n\nAnd that position is truly lowly. In new polls by NBC News and CNN, the Democratic Party has reached its lowest approval rating ever recorded: 27% and 29%, respectively. In both cases, these declines came about because many Democrats now say they disapprove of their own leadership.\n\nVoters in the Democratic base are clearly hungry for representatives who will oppose Trump loudly and without embarrassment.\n\nAnd why wouldn’t they? As Democratic voters watch in dismay while Donald Trump and Elon Musk dismantle the federal government and explore new frontiers of authoritarianism, they see few encouraging signs from too many of their leaders. The three living Democratic ex-presidents haven’t been heard from since Trump took office. Former Vice President Kamala Harris has been mostly invisible. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose presidential ambitions are no secret, is chatting it up with far-right activists and commentators on his new podcast. And while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, unlike Schumer, kept his caucus together to oppose the recent funding bill, he has largely been ineffectual.\n\nAnyone active on social media has seen a Democratic electorate enraged at Schumer and the other Senate Democrats who joined him in voting to advance the budget bill. In fairness to Schumer and these other senators, they argue that as bad as the bill was, a government shutdown would have done even more damage, especially since Trump and Musk could use the opportunity to eviscerate key agencies and shove thousands more government workers out the door. One might disagree with this view — and with Schumer’s messaging strategy — but it isn’t a crazy position to take.\n\nNevertheless, voters in the Democratic base are clearly hungry for representatives who will not only find the most pragmatic ways to counter Trump, but who will oppose him loudly and without embarrassment. That’s why figures such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Jasmine Crockett (D-Tex.) are commanding ever-larger followings as Democrats who seem to grasp the urgency of both the moment and their voters’ emotions.\n\nThat desire for fighting spirit is reflected in the polls. When NBC’s poll asked at the beginning of Trump’s first term whether Democratic voters wanted representatives who would “make compromises with President Trump to gain consensus on legislation” or “stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington,” they favored compromise by a 59-33 margin. Today, the numbers have flipped: Democratic voters now favor fighting, 65-32.\n\nSome Democrats in Congress would protest that without formal institutional power, there’s only so much they can do to thwart the president. That was the dilemma Republicans found themselves in during Barack Obama’s presidency. Even GOP voters considered Republican lawmakers feckless and weak, so they voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act an astonishing 70 times (depending on how you count).\n\nA base that has decided it can’t rely on leadership will start organizing for itself.\n\nIn the end, the repeal votes became a symbol of Republican impotence rather than resistance. Speaker of the House John Boehner was hounded from office in 2015 by tea party activists who considered him too weak to lead the fight against a president they despised. And Obama comfortably beat Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.\n\nBut look what else happened. Republicans took back the House, then the Senate and eventually the White House. They won sweeping gains at the state level: Democrats lost a net of 948 seats in state legislatures while Obama was president, the most a party had lost since Herbert Hoover was president, and 19 states saw chambers flip to Republican control.\n\nHow could that have happened while the national GOP looked so hapless? Ironically, the the national party’s poor standing may have helped spur its gains. That’s because an angry base is a motivated base, and a base that has decided it can’t rely on leadership will start organizing for itself.\n\nThat appears to be exactly what is beginning to happen now. Grassroots Democrats are organizing protests. Bernie Sanders is drawing crowds to his “Stopping Oligarchy” tour. The progressive group Run For Something, which helps liberals run for state and local offices, says it has signed up almost as many prospective candidates just since Trump’s inauguration as it did in all of 2017 and 2018. And activists are advocating primary challenges against Democratic leaders, just as tea partiers did to Republican leaders a decade ago.\n\nThat experience was uncomfortable for those running the party, but it showed that the party’s base was riled up and mad. And if some of Democrats’ anger is directed at their own leaders, that might be the most encouraging sign of a revival not just for the party’s institutions but its broader fortunes.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump is warning America that his economic plan could cause pain, unsettling the American public and financial markets. He’s not hiding it — he’s openly selling the idea that tariffs, government layoffs and cuts to social programs will send the economy into a downturn. His argument? That a recession now will lead to some vague \"golden age\" later. But that’s not how economies work.\n\nRecessions aren’t detox cleanses; they don’t flush out inefficiencies and leave you leaner and stronger. They are periods of mass job losses, closed businesses and financial ruin that leave lasting scars on families, workers and entire communities.\n\nRecessions aren’t detox cleanses; they don’t flush out inefficiencies and leave you leaner and stronger.\n\nWe know this because we’ve lived it — and not even that long ago. The 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession didn’t make the U.S. economy more efficient — it wiped out a generation of wealth, particularly for Black and Latino families, and left millions behind. The recession caused by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic deepened inequality and exacerbated housing insecurity, despite the fastest policy response in modern history.\n\nRecessions don’t set the stage for prosperity; they cause long-term damage that even a decade of growth can’t fully undo.\n\nTo be sure, some economists have argued recently that fears of a recession are possibly overblown. But an economic plan focused on causing deliberate harm to the American economy relies on old, discredited thinking: that recessions purge the system of waste, discipline workers into accepting lower wages and force companies to innovate.\n\nIn reality, recessions kill small businesses while the biggest corporations consolidate power. They drive up unemployment, forcing workers to take worse jobs for lower pay, and they weaken the very public institutions — like schools, health care and infrastructure — that enable long-term economic growth.\n\nEven worse, the current slate of proposed policies would actively make the economy more fragile.\n\nImposing broad tariffs would raise prices for consumers and manufacturers alike, increasing inflation while slowing down economic activity. Mass layoffs of government workers wouldn’t lead to leaner government — it would gut essential public services, hurting businesses that rely on those workers’ paychecks. And cutting Medicaid and Social Security wouldn’t create a more “dynamic” workforce; it would push millions into poverty, reduce consumer spending and force older Americans to stay in the workforce longer, crowding out younger workers from job opportunities.\n\nWe don’t have to theorize about what works. The past four years of economic policy have demonstrated how to grow an economy the right way: by investing in people.\n\nSince 2021, the U.S. economy has outperformed most other advanced economies, achieving strong gross domestic product growth beyond expectations. Here’s why.\n\nThe past four years of economic policy have demonstrated how to grow an economy the right way: by investing in people.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan injected direct financial relief into households, expanded the child tax credit and extended unemployment benefits, boosting consumer spending, preventing mass layoffs and cutting child poverty to record lows. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law accelerated investment in long-overdue infrastructure projects, creating jobs across industries like construction, transportation and water management while saving the average American household $700 per year. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act have revitalized domestic manufacturing, reducing reliance on foreign supply chains — all while keeping unemployment at historic lows.\n\nRather than forcing hardship in the name of a distant, uncertain recovery, these policies focused on expanding economic opportunity in real time.\n\nThis approach works because economic growth isn’t just about GDP figures — it’s about people’s ability to build secure, thriving lives. When workers have good wages and stable jobs, they spend money in their communities, supporting local businesses and driving demand. When public investments create new industries, they lay the foundation for long-term prosperity. And when economic policies prioritize affordability — lowering the cost of prescription drugs, housing and child care — they ensure that growth is shared, not just hoarded by the wealthiest few.\n\nThe Trump administration’s vision is clear: force a recession, break the public sector and weaken social protections, all hoping that something better will emerge on the other side. But history has shown us what actually happens — higher inequality, lower wages and an economy rigged even further in favor of the ultrawealthy. Economic downturns don’t just disappear once the pain subsides; they leave behind long-term damage.",

As David Corn explained for Mother Jones, Davis has a history of denouncing Israel’s government, which seems to have been the primary point of contention for Republicans.

        "content": "With Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency leading the charge, the Trump administration is intensifying attacks on the Social Security Administration and jeopardizing the vital benefits 1 in 5 Americans rely on. Under President Donald Trump-appointed leadership, the SSA recently announced its intent to eliminate 7,000 jobs, slicing the agency’s already skeletal staff down to the marrow. The SSA’s shrinking workforce already has been covering an increasing number of beneficiaries for years. With no capacity to spare, the consequences could quickly turn dire.\n\nAs the baby boomer generation ages, a record number of Americans are hitting retirement each year, making this exactly the moment when seniors most need Social Security’s systems to function in order to access the benefits they have earned. But as former Social Security Commissioner Martin O’Malley recently warned, the administration’s actions could break those systems and interrupt benefit payments.\n\nThese attacks on the Social Security Administration coincide with other ominous signals about the program’s future.\n\nIf Social Security benefits stop — or even experience delays — the impact will be immediate and catastrophic. In a recent survey, 42% of Americans age 65 and up reported they wouldn’t be able to afford necessities like food, clothes or housing without their monthly Social Security retirement benefits. Over 11 million disabled Americans under age 65 also receive benefits through Social Security — payments that are subject to strict rules limiting recipients’ ability to earn wages or accrue savings. For these disabled Americans, too, even a few days’ delay could mean not putting food on the table.\n\nEven if the Social Security Administration can keep payments flowing to existing beneficiaries despite these cuts, the rollbacks will still harm people seeking benefits. Already, Social Security staff are inundated to the point of being unable to process retirement claims, compounded by an aging IT system experiencing an increasing number of outages. And more than 1 million Americans are waiting on an initial determination for a disability claim. Often they are forced to run up credit card debt or sell their home as they wait for an answer with little to no income and often no health insurance. Staffing cuts and overtime restrictions will slow processing further and worsen the backlog.\n\nThe Trump administration’s cuts will also chip away at the customer service that claimants need. On Wednesday, the agency suddenly stopped allowing claimants to change their direct deposit arrangements by phone. According to the Washington Post, the SSA and Musk’s DOGE team had considered ending phone service entirely, but abandoned the idea after the Post reported on the proposal.\n\nYet even the smaller change has big consequences: Claimants will be forced to visit a field office in person or use the internet simply to update their bank information. This presents real accessibility challenges: Senior Americans, who make up the majority of claimants, are least likely to have broadband internet access at home, while DOGE posts have stoked fears of upcoming field office closures. As for the services still available by phone, wait times have skyrocketed to hours.\n\nThese attacks on the Social Security Administration coincide with other ominous signals about the program’s future. Trump’s joint address to Congress falsely alleged “shocking levels of incompetence and probably fraud” lurking within Social Security. He threatened to “find out where that money is going,” and suggested it’s “not going to be pretty.” Meanwhile, Musk called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” — a frequent talking point of the program’s right-wing critics like Project 2025 author Stephen Moore. House Republicans have floated the idea of cutting Social Security benefits for some disabled children, and groups like the Republican Study Committee have sought for years to cut benefits by raising the retirement age. The current attacks on the Social Security Administration may only be the beginning.\n\nEach month, over 70 million Americans check their mailbox or bank account for their Social Security benefits. For many, these checks can mean the difference between making rent and losing their home, between buying groceries and going hungry. By hamstringing the agency that provides these critical benefits, the Trump administration is putting the well-being of millions on the line.",

        "title": "Democratic leaders are failing the Mahmoud Khalil test",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s attempt to deport pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil marks one of Trump’s most egregious assaults on democratic liberties since taking office. Yet too many Democrats, particularly in party leadership, are responding to Trump in the most mealymouthed way possible. But this is a problem of Democrats’ own making: Their trepidation stems from their own history of repressing speech critical of Israel — and now we’re all at risk of paying the price for it.\n\nKhalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent, is a green-card holder who finished a master’s program at Columbia University in December (he is expected to graduate in the spring). He played a leading role in activism on Columbia’s campus last year objecting to Israel’s brutal treatment of Gaza, and served as a representative of student activists in negotiations with the university administration over a divestment campaign. A Columbia professor recently described him as a “consummate diplomat” who “seeks mediated resolutions through speech and dialogue.” He has an 8-month pregnant wife, who is a U.S. citizen.\n\nDemocratic leaders' response has been slow, divided and often feeble.\n\nThis legal permanent resident’s detention was made all the more disturbing by the way in which it was carried out. Khalil was detained in the lobby of his Columbia University-owned New York City apartment building on Saturday, with ICE agents changing their claims about his immigration status mid-arrest.\n\nAt first, the Trump administration provided no public legal explanation of its actions, even as it shipped Khalil to a detention facility in Louisiana. Green-card holders can be deported for certain crimes, but the government has not even charged Khalil with anything. Instead, the government is invoking an obscure provision of immigration law, which holds that an immigrant can be removed from the country if the U.S. secretary of state determines that their presence or activities are deemed to potentially have “serious adverse foreign policy consequences.” That’s why a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson has described Khalil as “aligned to Hamas.” But the administration has failed to provide any evidence or explanation for how this student activist is allegedly “aligned to Hamas” or poses a “serious” risk to U.S. foreign policy.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration is targeting him for his political speech and activism — and openly admitting that his arrest is meant to scare other pro-Palestinian activists. On Truth Social, Trump called Khalil a “Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student“ and warned that his arrest is the “first arrest of many to come.” He added: “We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it.”\n\nMany civil liberties advocates, centrist and left-of-center observers recognize Khalil’s detention as an assault on free speech. Georgetown legal scholar Steve Vladeck said that the Trump administration’s actions constitute “unconstitutional retaliation for First Amendment-protected speech.” The organization Jewish Voice for Peace said Trump’s actions were “designed to sow terror among students and immigrant communities” and its protesters poured into Trump Tower in Manhattan chanting “Fight Nazis, not students.” Donna Lieberman, executive director of NYCLU, likened Khalil’s detention to “McCarthyism” and described it as a “targeted, retaliatory, and an extreme attack on his First Amendment rights.” Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, described Trump’s move as “the kind of action one ordinarily associates with the world’s most repressive regimes.”\n\nSome Democrats have risen to the occasion. “We must be extremely clear: This is an attempt to criminalize political protest and is a direct assault on the freedom of speech of everyone in this country,” said a letter from 14 progressive House Democrats. Another letter, signed by over 100 House Democrats, said Khalil’s detention represents “the playbook of authoritarians, not of elected officials in a democratic society who claim to be the champions of free speech.”\n\nYet Democratic leaders’ response has been slow, divided and often feeble. New York Governor Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have refused to weigh in. And the statements of both House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer illustrate how caveats and hedging can undermine clear communication and standing for principles.\n\nBoth Jeffries and Schumer’s statements begin with caveats referencing how Khalil may have violated Columbia University’s rules and his behavior may warrant disciplinary action from the college regarding how he may have made Jewish students feel. But Khalil’s status at the university is irrelevant. At stake is his status in the United States. Bringing up Columbia’s disciplinary system allows Jeffries and Schumer to distance themselves from Khalil’s political cause. But the entire point of defending the First Amendment is to defend people’s rights to say things that are unpopular or even loathsome. (Note that nobody has provided evidence of how Khalil, who has denounced antisemitism, is antisemitic, and that Khalil’s lawyers say there is no evidence he supports Hamas.)\n\nBoth Jeffries’ and Schumer’s statements ask for the Trump administration to provide evidence of criminal activity in order to justify its actions. But that’s also a misfire: The Trump administration has made it crystal clear that this isn’t about criminal activity, but about political speech. A White House official even told The Free Press that “the allegation here is not that he was breaking the law.” Only after all the throat-clearing do the statements get around to saying that Trump’s actions appear to violate the Constitution in a measured tone.\n\nThe reason the mainstream of the Democratic leaders have been weak on this issue is because the party has been long opposed to the issue that Khalil represents — cutting off aid to Israel — and complicit in the free speech crisis themselves. President Joe Biden maintained almost uninterrupted military aid Israel, even as human rights observers and scholars described it as a genocide, and effectively aligned himself with draconian crackdowns on overwhelmingly peaceful pro-Palestinian student protests. And most House Democrats voted in favor of a bill conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Moreover, across institutions with ostensibly liberal cultures — in media, book publishing, the film industry and elsewhere — voices critical of Israel have been stifled or even purged. Khalil’s detention may violate the First Amendment, but in the U.S. there remains a Palestine exception to free speech.\n\nIf Democrats are wagering that this can be contained to one green-card holder, they are naive. Already Trump has canceled hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding to Columbia based on the pretext that it did not do enough to crack down on antisemitism. (This comes after Columbia expended immense resources to do so.) The message is clear: Trump wants to bully and intimidate as many institutions as possible to comply with its authoritarian assault on free speech. So far, Democratic leaders are not up for the fight.",

        "content": "Arlington National Cemetery has purged its website of pages about notable Black, Hispanic and women veterans, as well as information about the Civil War and Black history, as the Trump administration’s ongoing effort to remove references to “diversity and inclusion” on government webpages.\n\nAmong the pages that have disappeared from the cemetery’s website include links on the graves of prominent minority veterans, as well as educational pages on the Civil War, African American history and women’s history. Some of the information has been removed outright, while others were placed under categories that do not mention race or gender.\n\nAn archived version of the website’s educational page on African American history at the cemetery, for example, features a range of learning materials on the Civil Rights Movement and Black war heroes. That information no longer appears on the page.\n\nAn unnamed cemetery spokesperson told The Washington Post that links to webpages listing “Notable Graves” of Black, Hispanic and female veterans were taken down, and that the cemetery is working to make sure that content on its website complies with the administration’s policies.\n\nFirst reported by Civil War historian Kevin M. Levin and the military news publication Task & Purpose, the change follows Trump’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government.\n\nThe anti-DEI push has had a huge impact on the Defense Department in particular, where Secretary Pete Hegseth has vowed to get rid of what he calls “wokeness” in the military. Trump also fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. C.Q. Brown, the second Black man to hold the top military position, and pushed out Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the head of the U.S. Navy and the first woman to lead any branch of the armed forces.\n\n“I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength,’” Hegseth told Pentagon staff just days after being confirmed as defense secretary.\n\nSince then, the Defense Intelligence Agency has banned all activities related to cultural heritage celebrations, including Black History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, National American Indian Heritage Month, LGBTQ Pride Month, Women’s History Month, Juneteenth, Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nThe Pentagon is also seeking to bar trans people from serving in the military.\n\nIn February, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell wrote a memo ordering officials to “remove all DoD news and feature articles, photos, and videos that promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” by March 5. The Associated Press reported last week that the Pentagon has marked for removal more than 26,000 images of veterans from a diverse range of backgrounds and identities — which included an image of a B-29 aircraft that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima during World War II, the AP reported, because it was named “Enola Gay.”",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Those who watch Donald Trump’s Q&As invariably pick up on one of his go-to tactics. A reporter will ask a good and fair question that the president doesn’t appear to like, and instead of responding with something substantive, he’ll respond, “Who are you with?”\n\nAt that point, the journalist will respond by identifying his/her news organization, leading Trump to immediately and reflexively reply, “No wonder,” as if he’s proven some unstated point about independent news organizations asking questions that bother him.\n\nAt that point, the Republican will either move on — as if his childish rejoinder has sufficiently ended the matter — or he’ll respond in a way that suggests he considers the line of inquiry illegitimate.\n\nIt’s happened many times, including last week at an Oval Office event in which a reporter from Voice of America received the “who are you with?” treatment.\n\nThe snide exchange was uncalled for, but it was in keeping with the president’s longstanding disdain for VOA. When Trump tapped Arizona’s Kari Lake to be the next director of the Voice of America, many assumed that the network would continue, though it would be overhauled to be more overtly partisan.\n\nThose assumptions weren’t quite right. As The Washington Post reported, the president late last week signed an executive order seeking to eliminate several additional federal agencies, including the one that oversees the Voice of America.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) — the parent of VOA, Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia — is an independent agency established by Congress. In 2020, Congress passed a law intended to limit the power of the agency’s presidentially appointed chief executive. More than 1,300 journalists, producers and staff at VOA received an email saying they were placed on administrative leave Saturday, VOA Director Michael Abramowitz wrote on his private Facebook page.\n\nIn that same online message, Abramowitz also wrote, “[T]oday’s action will leave Voice of America unable to carry out its vital mission. That mission is especially critical today, when America’s adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States.”\n\nIt’s a key detail: As the Post’s report added, VOA exists “to counter authoritarian propaganda for foreign audiences with independent news.” That, evidently, is no longer in line with the White House’s international goals.\n\nIndeed, it’s worth emphasizing that while the gutting of the VOA generated headlines, it was not the only affected outlet: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty also lost its financing, and Radio and Televisión Martí, which promotes democracy to Cuba’s population, put its staff on administrative leave.\n\n“These media outlets have been a beacon of truth, democracy, and hope for millions of people around the world,” the European Commission said in a statement to Politico. “In an age of unmoderated content and fake news, journalism and freedom of press are critical for democracy. ... This decision risks benefiting our common adversaries.”\n\nThe Washington Post’s Max Boot added, “There is a sickening symmetry to President Donald Trump’s actions: While undermining U.S. democracy at home, he is also trying end U.S. government support for democracy abroad. His victims range from a leading human rights organization to the U.S. government networks that beam factual information to victims of oppression around the world.”\n\nWhat’s more, it’s worth emphasizing that the policy took effect quickly. This isn’t a situation in which the administration began a lengthy winddown process, assessing the policy implications over time. Rather, this is an instance in which Trump signed an order on Friday, and within two days, democracy-promoting networks were dark — for the first time in more than 80 years.\n\nSteven Herman, a longtime Voice of America correspondent, published a “requiem” over the weekend, writing, “To ​effectively shutter the Voice of America is to dim a beacon that burned bright during some of the darkest hours since 1942.”\n\nWhether Trump considers this a negative or a positive is not clear.",

        "content": "If Ukraine needs a wake-up call regarding how much agency it truly has, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s humiliating decision to sign the rare minerals deal, which would see America and Ukraine jointly extract valuable raw materials such as lithium and titanium, will do the trick. It’s hard to get more symbolic than watching the head of a client state get lambasted in the Oval Office, having the United States cut off sharing intelligence with his military, then shambling back over to his overseer to pay up.\n\nThere are, however, two underreported facets to this shameful episode that can help us understand the nature of both Washington and Ukraine. We can witness, in real time, the masks coming off of Washington’s foreign policy complex; we can also see why this particular betrayal is so traumatic and painful given Ukraine’s tragic history.\n\nWe can witness, in real time, the masks coming off of Washington’s foreign policy complex.\n\nThe refreshing thing about President Donald Trump is that he speaks the quiet part out loud. Politicians and think tankers who comprise Washington’s sprawling foreign policy establishment — “the Blob,” as it was called by Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes — love warbling about Ukraine’s battling on the front lines of freedom and Kyiv’s being our cherished partner, brimming with agency and sovereignty.\n\nTrump doesn’t warble. Trump, who loves harping on Europe’s needing to pay for its own security, has made it clear that freedom ain’t free: If Ukraine wants the weapons it needs to hold Russia at bay, it better cough up its minerals.\n\nThe thing is, when it comes to looting Ukraine, the Blob is little different from Trump. Foreign policy insiders’ lofty concerns about Kyiv’s agency evaporate in the face of economic “opportunities.”\n\n“Putin had two goals in invading Ukraine: robbing its territory, and robbing its sovereignty by preventing them from joining NATO,” thundered Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., on Feb. 16.\n\nBut just one day prior, Sen. Coons was striking a markedly different tone about Ukraine’s minerals.\n\n“If this is an investment opportunity where American companies and other companies from Europe would be involved in mining and processing, so that we can be independent of Chinese sources of these strategic minerals, and if his helps deepen and strengthen our partnership to help ensure the security of Ukraine going forward ... that would be a positive thing,” he told CNBC.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s robbing Ukraine is a horrific violation of sovereignty; the United States’ doing so is a positive. Let freedom ring.\n\nOr take Peter Dickinson — the editor of a Ukraine-centric blog for the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based foreign policy think tank that receives funding from arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin, the kingdom of Bahrain, the Charles Koch Foundation and the U.S. Energy Department, among other luminaries. “We hear lots of talk about geopolitics and what Putin wants, but we should not underestimate the agency of the Ukrainian people or their desire for a democratic European future,” Dickinson told Bloomberg in 2022.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s robbing Ukraine is a horrific violation of sovereignty; the United States’ doing so is a positive. Let freedom ring.\n\nLater that year, the X handle of Business Ukraine Mag (a publication edited and published by Dickinson) took Elon Musk to the woodshed, posting, “Elon Musk seems unaware that Ukrainian sovereignty is not up for discussion.” Things appear to have changed last month, however, when Dickinson was quoted in a Politico article with the amazing headline “Ukraine reels in Trump with mineral riches.” (It could have also read: “Bully’s victim reels in bully with lunch money.”)\n\nDickinson acknowledged that for Kyiv, it “would mean a lot less mineral wealth in future” before adding, “But I doubt anyone is very concerned about that.” He continued, “Compared to the alternative of the country being wiped off the map entirely, it looks like a very good deal indeed! Most Ukrainians certainly seem to view it as perhaps distasteful but ultimately a no-brainer.”\n\nThe hypocrisy of Ukraine’s purported Washington advocates only deepens given the role its territorial resources play in Ukraine’s identity — and the danger that could lurk for Zelenskyy, of all people, if he is strong-armed into conceding them.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the role land plays in the Ukrainian psyche. One modern interpretation of the country’s blue-over-yellow flag is that it represents blue skies over the golden wheat fields of Ukraine. Even the months of the year are named after the agricultural cycle — August is Sickle-time, for the harvest; November is Leaf-fall, for autumn.\n\nThis love of their land — and fear of losing it — was watered with blood after Holodomor: the 1932-1933 manmade famine, courtesy of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, after he ordered the grain seized from Ukraine. The famine, which many (including me) consider a genocide, saw almost 4 million Ukrainians perish of hunger. Every morning, dead bodies littered the streets as people collapsed where they walked. Cannibalism was commonplace.\n\nStalin sold the stolen wheat to industrialize the Soviet Union, including its military, which was used to keep Kyiv under Moscow’s power for the next 50-plus years; Ukraine’s grain helped forge Ukraine’s chains.\n\nUltranationalist elements of Ukraine seized on Holodomor to create the antisemitic lie that the famine was orchestrated by Jews. Starting with World War II, that deadly trope was used to “justify” Ukrainian participation in the Holocaust, a “you killed us, we killed you” narrative that persists on the Ukrainian far right to this day.\n\nYou can see it in graffiti scrawled on a Jewish social services center in the western city of Uzhhorod in 2017: “We remember. 1932-1933. We’ll take revenge.” The years referred to the famine; the graffiti appeared on the day Ukraine commemorates Holodomor victims.\n\nThe image of Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s first Jewish president, signing away his country’s rare minerals couldn’t be more perfect for Ukraine’s far right. He might as well be maniacally rubbing his hands together while being handed a bag with dollar signs.\n\nConsidering Kyiv is teetering on losing the war, which could unleash various nightmare scenarios, that image is not just disgusting but dangerous. Jews haven’t done well when they have been blamed for wars.\n\nThe kicker to the rare minerals deal is that much of the resources are in Ukraine’s east, either in Russia-controlled territory or in a no-man’s-land covered with land mines. Realistically, Zelenskyy has as much ability to give them away as I do. The only bankable outcome of this sordid mess is just a further painful reminder of how screwed Ukraine is.",

        "content": "President Donald Trump took his most dramatic step to claim executive powers in his eighth week in office, invoking the Alien Enemies Act to begin deporting noncitizens without giving them a chance to go before a judge.\n\nThe 1798 law has been invoked only three other times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. The last time it was used as part of the legal rationale for Japanese internment camps.\n\nHere’s a mostly complete look at what else the Trump administration has done over the last seven days:\n\n• Invoked the 18th century Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador.\n\n• Denied that it violated a court order temporarily blocking the deportations, arguing it \"had no lawful basis.\"\n\n• Deported a 10-year-old U.S. citizen recovering from brain cancer and her family to Mexico after detaining them on their way to one of her medical checkups.\n\n• Claimed that pardons of House Jan. 6 committee members and some others by then-President Joe Biden were now \"void.\"\n\n• Ruled out an exemption for Australia on steel and aluminum tariffs, as the European Union announced retaliatory trade actions.\n\n• Threatened to double steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada if Ontario added surcharges to electricity sold to the U.S.\n\n• Fired 1,300 workers from the Education Department, effectively gutting an agency he's vowed to shut down.\n\n• Announced that another 1,000 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration workers will be laid off.\n\n• Put 1,300 staffers at the Voice of America on paid leave amid plans to shutter the news agency, which was set up during World War II.\n\n• Passed a spending bill with $485 million more for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and nearly $1 billion in cuts to the budget of Washington, D.C.\n\n• Made plans to fire workers who preserve and maintain 26,000 works of art owned by the U.S. government.\n\n• Promoted Tesla on the White House lawn and said vandalism against the company will be treated as domestic terrorism.\n\n• Disbanded two federal committees tasked with advising policymakers on food safety.\n\n• Expelled the South African ambassador for criticizing the Trump administration, calling him \"persona non grata.\"\n\n• Withdrew a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nominee who had questioned the measles vaccine.\n\n• Reversed more than 100 terminations of leases for federal buildings around the country.\n\n• Threatened to impose a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and liquor amid a trade war with the European Union.\n\n• Lost in court as two judges ordered the administration to reinstate thousands of fired federal workers.\n\n• Deported a kidney transplant doctor and professor even though a judge had issued an order blocking it.\n\n• Launched investigations into 52 universities, accusing them of \"racial preferences\" for diversity efforts.\n\n• Threatened to pull federal funding to Columbia University unless it overhauls admissions and cedes control of academic departments.\n\n• Faced a major protest as demonstrators took over Trump Tower to demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil.\n\n• Was sued by a group of Democratic state attorneys general over efforts to dismantle the Education Department.\n\n• Directed military officials to draw up options for increasing the troop presence in Panama, according to two U.S. officials.\n\n• Asked the Supreme Court to narrow court orders so that it can put into effect a new policy against birthright citizenship.\n\n• Terminated $20 billion worth of Biden-era grant agreements to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects.\n\n• Refused, in confirmation hearings for Dr. Mehmet Oz to lead Medicare and Medicaid, to commit to not cut Medicaid.\n\n• Sued, through various entities affiliated with Trump, Capital One bank for closing accounts after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n• Delivered a highly politicized speech claiming he was persecuted to officials at the Justice Department.\n\n• Argued in that speech that reporting by independent news outlets is biased and should be \"illegal.\"\n\n• Promoted Steak 'n Shake beef tallow-cooked fries in an interview with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n• Said, in an interview with the commerce secretary, that Trump's policies would be \"worth it\" even if they led to a recession.\n\n• Fired a pardon attorney who said she believes she was ousted because she refused to restore Mel Gibson's right to carry a gun.\n\n• Made plans for a registry that would require Canadians staying in the U.S. for longer than a month to get fingerprinted.\n\n• Criticized The Wall Street Journal by saying it's \"owned by the polluted thinking of the European Union.\"\n\nSubscribe to Trump’s First 100 Days newsletter for weekly updates on and expert insight into the key issues and figures defining his second term.",

        "content": "Victoria Ellen Bruce, my mom’s younger sister, loved to play bid whist, hear a good joke and never saw a purse she didn’t need. “Oooh, girl, give it here,” she’d say on the regular.\n\nAunt Vicki, who lived with multiple sclerosis for most of her adult life, died last year at a long-term residential facility where not even my mother’s dogged and formidable advocacy kept her from being neglected.\n\nAunt Vicki died at a long-term residential facility where not even my mother’s dogged advocacy kept her from being neglected.\n\nMost people living in long-term care facilities are on Medicaid. The program keeps them alive, paying for their care and housing. Shamefully, my House Republican colleagues just passed a budget proposal that cuts Medicaid to help fund tax breaks for wealthy Americans. Medicaid needs more money, not less.\n\nThe loss of Aunt Vicki has been painful for my family. My mother grieves every day. She thinks about her, talks about her and cries over her. Losing a younger sibling is incredibly hard, especially one as full of life, love, hope and faith as my aunt.\n\nJust as Aunt Vicki’s nursing career was taking off, we would go out to places and she would fall. It didn’t happen often but, after too many of these unresolvable episodes, she went in for tests and was diagnosed with the debilitating and incurable disease that is MS. We were all shocked. No one else in the family had ever had MS. The falls became more frequent. She was not able to continue her nursing career. A walker led to a wheelchair, a scooter and eventually a bed at a long-term residential facility.\n\nVictoria Ellen Bruce, right, with family members. Courtesy Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove\n\nMy aunt had the best caregivers in my grandmother (a nurse) and my mom (a Leo). They both fought hard against the system. Aunt Vicki loved receiving phone calls from me. We would talk, laugh and share stories. Eventually, she would tell me about some grievance with the nursing home, and then she would say how grateful she was for my mother for making it right. We should all be so lucky to have a caregiver as fierce as my mom.\n\nIn January, my mom came to Washington to watch me get sworn into Congress. Before she left, we discussed an article she had read about Melinda Lunday, who works for the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program. The ombudsman’s job is to visit assisted living facilities and residential care homes to ensure that patients, our family members, are not abused. Through my own research, I read about a patient who died after mistaking cleaning chemicals for juice. In some facilities, elderly individuals or patients with disabilities have gone unwashed for more than a year, do not get their teeth brushed regularly or are forced to sleep overnight in soiled briefs.\n\nThe ombudsman’s job is to visit assisted living facilities and residential care homes to ensure that our family members are not abused.\n\nAgain, even with my mother staying as vigilant as she was, Aunt Vicki was neglected by the system. As the MS worsened, she needed more consistent and observant care, but her health and safety became increasingly compromised because she didn’t get what she deserved.\n\nThe disease eventually made her completely bedridden. Because she stayed in the same position for hours at a time without being moved, she developed bed sores that turned into open wounds. The first time mom saw one of Aunt Vicki’s wounds, she said, “It was so deep, I could see to the bone.”\n\nMy mother would ride the nursing home administrators. That is the life of a caregiver. She would visit regularly, write letters, make phone calls and chew people out; Vicki’s care would improve for a little while and then backslide again.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, annual federal funding for the nationwide ombudsman program was set at $22 million and $27 million, well below what’s needed to fund the recommended ombudsmen-per-bed ratios. In 2023, there were 202,894 complaints regarding long-term care facilities, but only 4,943 ombudsmen staff and volunteers available to investigate.\n\nThat is a disgrace.\n\nFor many patients, their only advocate and hope is an ombudsman. Without them, many of our loved ones will suffer and die. That’s why it’s so unconscionable that Republicans are trying to slash Medicaid when it helps states pay for this critical program and others like it.\n\nIn 2023, there were 202,894 complaints regarding long-term care facilities, but only 4,943 ombudsmen staff and volunteers available to investigate.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is lying when he says Republican cuts will not touch Medicaid. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, it’s impossible to cut $880 billion from the House Energy and Commerce Committee budget, which Republicans want to do, without gutting Medicaid, Medicare or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. It’s mathematically unavoidable.\n\nCaregivers like my mom and patients like my aunt deserve a Medicaid program that is properly resourced so that it works for those who rely on it. Government programs cannot be efficient if workers are fired, funding is slashed and services are eliminated.\n\nI encourage people who’ve had an Aunt Vicki in their life to share their stories with their representative in Congress. We must breathe life into Medicaid with our experiences, so that everyone understands how vital this program is for our families and for the people we love.",

        "title": "Trump is trying to make an example out of Columbia University",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Last week, the Trump administration crossed a red line in its unprecedented attack on American higher education. In a letter to Columbia University, the administration laid out a series of sweeping changes that the school must take to reverse the administration’s cancellation of $400 million in federal funding. The letter affirms that for the faculty and administrators at American colleges and universities, silence is no longer an option. They must speak out and act, both individually and collectively.\n\nIn canceling the grants earlier this month, the Trump White House accused Columbia of “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” The administration’s new letter details “immediate next steps that we regard as a precondition for formal negotiations regarding Columbia University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government.” Each of those steps touches on the university’s core functions.\n\nAmerican colleges and universities are in uncharted territory, and they are temperamentally unprepared for confrontation.\n\nAmong other things, the federal government demands that Columbia change its admissions practices and its disciplinary process, including mandating the “arrest and removal of agitators who foster an unsafe or hostile work or study environment.” It requires the university to ban masks “intended to conceal identity or intimidate others.” It even demands that the university put its Middle East, South Asian and African Studies Department in academic receivership.\n\nPutting an academic department in receivership would remove governance of that department, including control over its curriculum, from its faculty. As The Associated Press notes, receivership “is a rarely used practice,” and only if a department cannot manage its own affairs. That is not the case with respect to this particular department. One can (almost) admire the Trump administration’s ingenuity in using receivership as a smoke screen for censorship.\n\nNonnegotiable preconditions like these more commonly come from hostage-takers or terrorists than officials in a democratically elected government. But that is where this country and its higher education institutions now find themselves.\n\nIf the government can single out an academic department at a college or university because of what it teaches or how it teaches, there would be nothing left of academic freedom. We have seen hints of this kind of attack on higher education in this country before, especially during the Red Scare of the early 1950s. But according to Joan Scott, a historian and member of the academic freedom committee of the American Association of University Professors, the Trump administration’s latest demands on Columbia are “an escalation of a kind that is unheard of. Even during the McCarthy period in the United States, this was not done.”\n\nBefore the administration’s latest letter to Columbia, in an article aptly titled “First They Came for Columbia,” Harvard University’s Ryan Enos and Steven Levitsky called on their university to express solidarity with its fellow Ivy League school. “Autocrats — both left-wing and right-wing — always attack universities,” they wrote. “Its claim to be fighting campus antisemitism rings ... hollow ... Autocrats are allergic to sources of dissent, so they almost invariably seek to silence, weaken, or control them.”\n\nAmerican colleges and universities are in uncharted territory, and they are temperamentally unprepared for confrontation. They still emphasize discussion over direction and consensus over coercion, particularly as these institutions become more corporate.\n\nColleges and universities have little time to get their bearings, but passivity is the wrong path.\n\nAs Enos and Levitsky explain, “Most universities — including Harvard — have responded to these attacks with strategies of self-preservation. They are lying low, avoiding public debate (and sometimes cooperating with the administration) in the hope of mitigating the coming assault.” Those schools not yet in the government’s crosshairs are keeping their heads down lest they replace Columbia as the White House’s top target.\n\nColleges and universities have little time to get their bearings, but passivity is the wrong path. They need to organize in defense of Columbia now. This defense should comprise more than just statements. College presidents should go to Columbia’s campus and be seen with its president, lobby on its behalf with lawmakers, mobilize their alums, and, where possible, offer financial support.\n\nFailing to do so is, as Enos and Levitsky say, not only “morally objectionable,” but self-defeating. “Columbia’s leadership made repeated concessions to right-wing critics,” they point out, “only to be the first to come under attack.”\n\nThere is much to scrutinize and criticize about events at Columbia in the post-Oct. 7 period. But addressing those issues is not the federal government’s responsibility. All of us in higher education, not just university presidents, must say so.\n\nAs the New York Times’ M. Gessen noted last month, history teaches that “for people to be able to stand up (to authoritarianism), they needed the words.” That is why the administration’s attempt to bring Columbia and other universities to heel is so important, not just for the fate of higher education but for every American. Colleges and universities are in the business of fashioning the words and ideas needed to help people understand why standing up for democracy is so important.\n\nAll of us in higher education must get busy with that work. We can start by defending Columbia University. If we fail to do so, we will fail higher education and also the entire country.",

        "title": "Democratic voters’ attitudes on partisan compromise undergo a dramatic shift",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "While the topline takeaways in the latest NBC News poll related to Donald Trump and his weakening public standing, there were some revelations related to Democratic voters’ attitudes that were every bit as interesting, if not more so. From the network’s analysis:\n\nBack in April 2017, 59% of Democrats said they wanted congressional Democrats to make compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation, with 33% saying they should stick to their positions even if that means not being able to get things done in Washington. Now, that sentiment has completely flipped. Almost two-thirds of Democrats, 65%, say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions even if that risks sacrificing bipartisan progress, and just 32% want them to make legislative compromises with Trump.\n\nThe shift from 2017 to 2025 is certainly notable, given the relevant parallels: It compares the beginning of the president’s first term with the beginning of his second.\n\nBut there’s also value in looking back even further. I wrote an item for the Washington Monthly about this way back in 2011, noting an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll that reflected striking partisan asymmetry: At the time, in the wake of the 2010 midterm elections, more than two-thirds of Democratic voters (68%) said they expected their party’s leaders to make compromises as part of a broader effort to gain consensus. The same data found a majority of Republican voters (56%) arguing that GOP leaders should stick to their guns and avoid compromise, no matter the consequences.\n\nA week earlier, a Pew Research Center survey pointed in a nearly identical direction: Most Democratic voters said Democratic officials should focus on compromise, while most Republican voters wanted GOP officials to stand on principle. A Gallup poll taken around the same time found very similar results.\n\nThe disconnect between the parties was extraordinary, and it endured for quite a while. For over a decade, Democratic voters embraced a compromise-based approach because it appeared unavoidable: In a complex, Madisonian style of government, filled with choke points and pitfalls, give-and-take is baked into the system. It seemed wholly unrealistic to think any one party or faction would get everything it wanted, so rank-and-file Democrats naturally understood that concessions and negotiations would be part of any responsible approach to governing.\n\nThe Democratic base not only endorsed compromise as part of a mature policymaking model, those same voters also expected it.\n\nMost Republican voters fundamentally rejected such a posture, insisting that those who compromised were guilty of weakness and betrayals.\n\nNot surprisingly, the parties’ elected officials internalized these attitudes. It became the norm for Democratic officials — in the White House and on Capitol Hill — to strive for bipartisan agreements, while GOP officials equated bipartisan dealmaking with defeat.\n\nIn time, not surprisingly, Democrats noticed that they weren’t getting many RSVPs to the compromise parties they threw. Republicans slapped away outstretched hands. Olive branches were treated like poison ivy. GOP officials even abandoned some of their own ideas and priorities the moments Democrats endorsed them.\n\nIn other words, there’s no great mystery as to why, exactly, the Democratic base has shifted so dramatically in its approach to bipartisan negotiation and cooperation.\n\nTo be sure, it’s a multifaceted dynamic. The increasing radicalization of Republican politics necessarily repulses much of the Democratic mainstream, making compromise effectively impossible. Relatedly, given the degree to which the incumbent GOP president appears indifferent to bipartisan governing and reality, it’s not too surprising to see so many Democratic voters reject the idea of trying to work with him in good faith in pursuit of common ground.\n\nBut at the heart of the debate, there’s an inescapable realization: Democratic voters were on board with compromises until they grew tired of being alone. Now, according to the data, they’re ready for something different — thanks entirely to the conditions that Republicans themselves created.\n\nThe question for party leaders is whether Democratic policymakers are ready to reassess years’ worth of assumptions and adapt to their base’s new set of expectations.",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer was right to avoid a government shutdown",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "With the threat of a government shutdown averted after the Senate passed a government funding bill Friday, Washington and the nation can breathe a sigh of relief. But in the aftermath, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is the object of angry Democrats in Congress and across the country who wanted a fight with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. As a former senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am a veteran of numerous government-funding fights. I know what causes shutdowns and the difficulty of reopening the government after a shutdown. Schumer faced an incredibly difficult predicament and he was right to support keeping the government open.\n\nLet’s start with the basics. Since the start of the fiscal year in October, the federal government has been operating on a continuing resolution, which means the government was being funded (with limited exceptions) at levels set the previous fiscal year. The bill enacted on Friday extends funding through September, the end of the fiscal year. It funds the government largely at current levels, although defense spending is slightly increased while domestic spending is a slightly decreased.\n\nWhile a year-long CR is a terrible way to run the federal government, it is better than a government shutdown.\n\nThere is a word to describe governing by CR: failure. CRs represent Congress’ failure to do its most fundamental task: responsibly fund the government. The executive branch, especially the Pentagon, have real difficulty operating under CR’s. Some funding accounts will be depleted and in need of replenishment; others will be too flush and in need of reduction. It is very difficult for the executive branch to move monies between accounts without congressional sign-off — not that this fact will discourage the Trump administration from trying.\n\nBut while a yearlong CR is a terrible way to run the federal government, it is better than a government shutdown. Schumer is being pummeled for his decision by his angry Democratic base for not fighting the CR, but he understood things could get much worse for federal employees and congressional Democrats during a shutdown. Trump would be empowered to determine which federal employees were essential or nonessential. Trump surely would have designated as many federal employees as possible nonessential and furlough them. The so-called Department of Government Efficiency would run wild, putting even more employees at risk of permanent dismissal. Recalling all those furloughed nonessential employees would have been enormously challenging.\n\nAs for Democrats’ political struggles against the Trump administration, a shutdown would have redirected the focus away from the economy, Trump’s destructive tariffs, appeasement of Russia and betrayal of Ukraine, and Elon Musk’s chainsaw and wood chipper approach to reducing the federal workforce. Furthermore, the party making the policy demand is blamed for a shutdown. Republicans were blamed in 2013 and 2018-19 shutdowns for wanting to defund Obamacare and immigration demands, respectively. That’s because demanding policy concessions to keep the government open is not a winning argument. It’s the equivalent of a small child holding his breath and waiting for everyone else to turn blue. It doesn’t work.\n\nFurthermore, Schumer was likely honoring the wishes of members who wanted him to save them from themselves. Punchbowl reported Monday that “based on our conversations with Democratic senators, many more Senate Democrats than just the nine who voted with Schumer agreed with his ultimate decision.” This is a familiar strategy in Washington, known as “vote no, hope yes.” Leadership can be a lonely job when tough decisions like this one are required. After all, a leader with no followers is just a guy taking a walk.\n\nTo be clear, Schumer’s handling of this situation was not perfect. First, if he intended to fold, he should have done so sooner and not raised expectations of fighting the House-passed GOP funding bill. Second, congressional Democrats failed to articulate clearly what they even wanted in the bill, which muddled their message. Third, Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries were not coordinated in their negotiating strategy with congressional Republicans.\n\nBut had Schumer chosen to fight, Democrats would likely have shouldered at least part of, if not most, of the blame for what could have been a protracted, painful shutdown. The bottom line is Senate Democrats were in a terrible, no-win position. The choice was to fight and shut down the government, or fold and find better ground for another day. Schumer, smartly but painfully, chose the latter. He made the right choice and took one for the team.",

        "title": "Who is Gavin Newsom's podcast for?",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has a new podcast called “This Is Gavin Newsom.” Many Democrats are not going to be happy about it, because thus far all it shows is that Newsom is not who we thought he was.\n\nAs Newsom put it, the show’s premise is talking to “people I disagree with, people I look up to.” Over the first few episodes, the governor’s chat partners have only been far-right activists and commentators, so one would expect them to fall in the first category. Yet Newsom is so deferential to his guests — even when they spread noxious right-wing propaganda — that sometimes they seem to fit more clearly in the latter category.\n\nIt's not clear if Newsom has a clear command of his new project.\n\nNewsom is widely considered a serious contender for the 2028 Democratic nomination, and his decision to start a podcast and invite big-name right-wingers — like former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk — seems like an obvious attention grab. But it’s not clear if Newsom has a clear command of his new project, or whether the attention he seeks could backfire on him.\n\nThe first episode featured Newsom telling Kirk that his son is a fan of the MAGA activist. Newsom also agreed with or praised Kirk scores of times — so much, in fact, that Kirk later said “Gov. Newsom was being overly effusive in his praise of me.” Listening to the Democrat — who as mayor of San Francisco two decades ago was at the vanguard of the gay rights movement — gush with warmth and admiration for a far-right commentator who has promoted the racist “great replacement theory,” called for completely banning gender-affirming care for trans people and described trans people as “disgusting, mentally ill, neurotic, predatory freaks” was jarring and disheartening.\n\nIn the headline-generating moment of the interview, Newsom said it was “deeply unfair” to allow transgender women and girls to compete in female sports. He also objected to “woke culture,” saying nobody in his office ever used the term “Latinx” — even though he has used the term himself in the past multiple times. The conversation seemed to signal that Newsom is moving to the right of the Democratic Party establishment on a number of culture war issues.\n\nNewsom’s newly revealed positions represent the strain of thinking in some Democratic circles that the party should retreat from less popular policy positions and linguistic norms tied to progressive inclusivity in order to appeal to a wider base. Recent polls from YouGov and The New York Times/Ipsos have found that a sizable majority of Americans believe trans women should not be able to participate in women’s sports. And some data shows that the term Latinx, which is an attempt to make the term “Latino” more gender neutral, can drive Latino voters away from Democrats.\n\nIt is theoretically possible that shifting on the issue of trans women in sports could make Democrats more appealing to the general electorate. But there’s also reason to be skeptical. Vice President Kamala Harris kept trans issues at a distance during her 2024 White House bid, but she was still defined by the right over her earlier positions. And survey data and studies consistently showed trans issues were never a top-tier issue for voters in the election and had little to no effect on voter choice.\n\nIn other words, it’s possible that Newsom — who until this podcast had been considered an exceptional LGBTQ ally — is signaling a distance from the trans community that would never endear him to people on the right. The pivot is likely to come off as insincere to many, in part because the binary between Democrats and Republicans on trans rights is so stark that Democratic moderation will go unrewarded.\n\nThe other issue for Newsom is that if he were ever to run for president, he’d have to get through the primary electorate first. And it’s clear that Newsom has immediately sparked a backlash online from many progressives who think his pivot is expedient and marks an abandonment of the trans community. Every presidential hopeful has to watch both their right and their left flank — and navigate those challenges without being branded a total phony.\n\nNewsom’s conversation with Bannon was also packed with deference and praise for one of the most influential architects of the Trump era. Newsom allowed Bannon to casually lie about the 2020 election without pushback, and to define right-wing populism as “anti-elitist” without any substantive objection about Trump’s billionaire-friendly presidency. Newsom also chuckled as Bannon implied that the legal cases against Trump were purely political. Given the tone of the rest of the conversation, the laugh came off as sympathetic rather than a recognition of absurdity.\n\nIt wasn’t a debate or a dialogue; on everything from DOGE to tariffs, Bannon ran the table and Newsom mostly nodded along. To be sure, on occasion Newsom pushed back on issues like trade, but those were the exceptions proving the rule, and the overall effect was to normalize the rest of Bannon’s noxious misinformation and right-wing theories of society — which went unchallenged.\n\nIt’s hard to tell if Newsom knows what he’s doing or how he’s coming across. Politicians like former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., know how to talk in a persuasive and respectful tone to conservative audiences while maintaining their adherence to liberal and social democratic values, respectively.\n\nNewsom, by contrast, comes off in these podcast episodes like a dupe and a pushover to progressives, and it’s doubtful that his acquiescent posture will translate to votes from across the aisle. Even on the level of pure political education, Newsom’s project is irresponsible. He’s effectively sane-washing lots of right-wing talking points that demand more serious engagement than he’s demonstrated he’s capable of providing, and he is not advancing arguments about how folks on the right should see it in their interest to reconsider the left.\n\nIt begs the question: Who is “This Is Gavin Newsom” for?",

        "title": "Why Trump businesses’ lawsuit against Capital One bank is so ridiculous",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Earlier this month, a collection of people and entities affiliated with President Donald Trump — specifically, the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, DJT Holdings LLC, DJT Holdings Managing Member LLC, DTTM Operations LLC and Eric Trump — sued Capital One bank for having “unjustifiably” closed numerous Trump-associated bank accounts in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe lawsuit pleads that “de-banking” — closing depositors’ bank accounts — was originally meant to stop fraudsters from having access to banking facilities but it morphed into a way to punish depositors for their political beliefs. The lawsuit explains that completely legal gun and ammunition dealers or payday lenders often found themselves de-banked by unelected bureaucrats who disagreed with the businesses’ political beliefs. The plaintiffs claim to have been damaged by this type of de-banking when Capital One closed Trump accounts because of the Trumps’ “political views.” The Trumps seek damages under an assortment of state consumer protection laws.\n\nJust how many ways is this lawsuit silly? Let me count them.\n\nAs a purely legal matter, the Trumps don’t appear to have suffered any recoverable money damages. According to the lawsuit, Capital One closed the Trump bank accounts. Presumably, the bank returned the Trumps’ money to them — the lawsuit doesn’t say otherwise, and it’s inconceivable the bank would have stolen the Trumps’ money. (A representative for Capital One declined to comment for this article.)\n\nIt’s true that individual depositors with small accounts — such as gun shops — might have trouble setting up new banking relationships after they were “de-banked,” but a large real estate business, such as the Trump Organization, would have had no trouble on that score. So while we don’t know for certain, the Trumps’ situation was presumably this: Capital One closed the Trumps’ bank accounts, Capital One returned the Trumps’ money, the Trumps promptly found a new bank, and the Trumps, uninjured, went on with their business.\n\nA fundamental element of any lawsuit is that a plaintiff must have suffered damages. Here, except perhaps for the inconvenience of changing bankers, the Trumps suffered none.\n\nWhere’s the case?\n\nBut that’s just the legal flaw in this lawsuit. Think for a moment about the practical flaws.\n\nJust how many ways is this lawsuit silly? Let me count them.\n\nIs any jury going to believe that Capital One stopped its banking relationship in the months after Jan. 6 because of Donald Trump’s political beliefs? Did the bank really think, “Donald Trump doesn’t like affirmative action and he opposes DEI, so we should close his accounts”?\n\nOr is it far more likely — and in fact almost certainly true, and sure to be believed by a jury in a heartbeat — that Capital One closed the Trumps’ bank accounts because it didn’t care to be associated with a person who appeared to have incited an insurrection and then stood by silently for three hours as rioters ransacked the Capitol?\n\nJust about everyone in America — all Democrats, and even some Republicans — knew that Trump was “practically and morally responsible for provoking the events” of Jan. 6, as then-GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell put it at the time.\n\nThis wasn’t a matter of politics; it was a matter of morality.\n\nCapital One didn’t close the Trumps’ bank accounts because of Trump’s political views. Capital One has denied that it closed the bank accounts for political reasons, but it wouldn’t be unreasonable to surmise that the bank didn’t care to be associated with anyone — Democratic, Republican or independent — who tried to interfere with the counting of votes in a presidential election. Handling financial transactions for Trump both would have been immoral and would have posed a reputational risk for the bank. Ending that relationship wasn’t improper; it was sane.\n\nAlthough many Americans seem to have forgiven Trump’s gross misconduct over the four years since the Jan. 6 riot, that misconduct could fully justify Capital One’s closing of the bank accounts.\n\nBut the practical flaws in the Trumps’ lawsuit don’t stop there.\n\nIn any lawsuit, the parties are permitted to take discovery — gather information — from each other. Capital One will thus have the right to request documents and take testimony from Donald Trump and others about Trump’s conduct on Jan. 6. As the House Jan. 6 committee proceedings made clear, there is nothing about Trump’s conduct in early January 2021 that is praiseworthy; there is much that should be condemned. Does Trump really want to relive, and again place in the public eye, the events of one of the most notorious days in his life?\n\nThere are many reasons for the Trumps to abandon this lawsuit. There is only one reason for them to pursue it: to get a financial settlement.\n\nThere’s no legal reason for Capital One to settle the Trumps’ newest lawsuit. The lawsuit is both defensible and embarrassing for Trump to pursue. But there are surely practical reasons — avoiding the wrath the federal government could inflict on a bank — for Capital One to cough up some dough to make this go away.\n\nIs that justice? Not by a long shot.\n\nBut does it appear to be a recurring way for Trump to profit while he has the government on his side? Bank on it.",

        "title": "Bill Burr’s new special is very funny, even if his politics are a confusing mess",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Bill Burr talks a whole lot about men in his new comedy special “Drop Dead Years,” which debuted on Hulu on Friday. Why is it, he wonders aloud, that only men “drop dead,” usually between the ages of 49 and 61, sometimes while manscaping “in the upstairs bathroom while listening to AC/DC”? How come “men aren’t allowed to be sad”? “We’re allowed,” he continues, “to be one of two things: mad or ‘fine.’ That’s it.” If you want to see sad men doing sad things in their natural sad habitat, Burr suggests, visit your local Guitar Center.\n\nBurr is also thinking about men in much more personal terms. “Drop Dead Years” opens up with the comedian, offstage, reflecting candidly:\n\nIt’s kind of a weird thing to be over 50 and realize how f----d up you are. Like, I thought I did stand-up because I loved comedy. And then what I really figured out is that, no, that’s not why I did it. I did stand-up because that was the easiest way to walk into a room full of a bunch of people that I didn’t know and make everybody like me. All of the way I’ve moved through the world has always been like, ‘Where’s the place I have the least chance of being hurt?’\n\nBill Burr is a therapeutic work in progress. He’s bravely figuring himself out ... in public. The process, however, is not free of contradictions. Nor is it going very smoothly.\n\nIn “Drop Dead Years,” as in previous specials, he copiously mocks women, feminists, gays, liberals, trans people, overweight people, etc. And while the results are often very funny, this sure is an odd way to get “everybody” in the room to like him.\n\nThe response to his controversial “Saturday Night Live” monologue of 2020, in which he lit up “cancel culture,” is a case in point. As is his postelection 2024 “SNL” appearance, when he counseled women not to wear pantsuits like Kamala Harris did. Instead, the ladies who seek elected office should “whore it up a bit.”\n\nWhat truly separates Burr from the manosphere bros is that he appears to be making an earnest attempt at introspection.\n\nIt’s tempting to situate a comedian like Burr in the present comedic “manosphere.” That would be the dank man cave where Joe Rogan, Tony Hinchcliffe, Theo Von and others trash liberal pieties, garner immense crowds and earn success and influence in the process. Like them, Burr’s got the stage rage. He’s got the confrontational “I’m so mad my heart is about to explode!” affect. He too delights in (rhetorically) coldcocking minorities.\n\nBut Burr is different. He’s not only older than these boys, he is infinitely more intelligent. A heady gag in “Drop Dead Years” about KKK members riding in the HOV lane reminds us that Burr is a thinking man’s comic in the style of George Carlin. He’s also an exceptionally skilled physical actor. He uses his body, pasty white face and bald dome (which shines like a diamond under the stage lights) in ways that few can rival: I especially appreciated his imitation of a man dropping dead out of a golf cart.\n\nAnd then there’s what we might call Burr’s balance. He’s not averse to punching up. In an interview with NPR’s Terry Gross this past week, the comic set his sights on Elon Musk. “I just refuse to believe,” Burr declared, reflecting on the billionaire’s Inauguration Day salutes, “that it was an accidental, two-time ‘Sieg heil.’”\n\nYet what truly separates Burr from the manosphere bros is that he appears to be making an earnest attempt at introspection. As the opening comments in this latest special suggest, Burr is doing the work, limning the pain, trying to be a better husband and dad. He’s boldly marching into the aforementioned room — a “room,” I might add, that streams to a few million people — and bleeding out.\n\nBurr’s asking questions. Why can’t men wrap themselves in an afghan, sit in a corner and brood like women can? Why can’t men be sad? The problem is that, like Dave Chappelle, he also demands to know why he can’t use a homophobic slur anymore.\n\nHis public therapeutic turn, with all of its contradictions, is equally evident in the NPR interview with Gross. One second he’s decimating Musk’s “laminated face” and the next (like, literally one second later), he’s talking about why he hates liberals. One second he’s confronting his flawed masculinity; moments later, he’s subjecting Gross to the type of off-the-shelf manosphere rebuttals that are guaranteed to drive liberal women, among others, to distraction. (The normally serene Gross, for her part, at some points low-key loses her patience with Burr’s evasions and interruptions.)\n\nBurr is doing the work, limning the pain, trying to be a better husband and dad.\n\nBill Burr is extremely funny. But politically, the man is completely incomprehensible.\n\nIn terms of psychic self-awareness, I don’t think he’s quite “there” yet (wherever that may be). Admirably, he’s realized that he performs his comedy to avoid getting hurt. It therefore boggles the mind that he seems to make no effort to interrogate whether and how his jokes, broadcast to multitudes, might hurt other people, whether that’s gay men, or women bemoaning Harris’ election loss (and their personal freedoms).\n\nThe closing sequence of “Drop Dead Years” provides a clue as to how Burr may presently resolve all this psychic tumult. A few moments earlier, he had mentioned that he was touched inappropriately as a child (“I got touched as a kid”). Now the credits have rolled, we’re in the alley behind the theater. Away from the crowd. Everything’s quiet. Burr is sitting on the stoop of the stage door. His buddy is eating a sandwich and drinking a beer. Burr is smoking a cigar. It’s a good cigar. Maybe, the moment suggests, men achieve psychic resolution by being alone with other men.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "We start the week with a question that has arisen in multiple cases just a couple of months in to Donald Trump’s second term: Did his administration violate a court order?\n\nThe latest iteration of the question comes in litigation that developed quickly over the weekend, after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport people who the administration said are members of a transnational gang called Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union sued, and on Saturday, the chief federal trial judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the government not to remove people pursuant to Trump’s proclamation. The government is appealing Judge James Boasberg’s temporary restraining orders, and litigation will proceed in the D.C. federal appeals court this week as the Trump administration seeks to upend them.\n\nBut in the meantime, the ACLU told Boasberg in a court filing early Monday that “media reports and publicly available data” suggest that the government defendants “may have violated the Court’s Orders.” The plaintiffs asked the judge to “seek immediate clarification from Defendants, in one or more sworn declarations, about their conduct regarding this Court’s Orders.”\n\nThe plaintiffs noted that Boasberg had told the government to turn around any planes carrying people pursuant to the proclamation, and they questioned the government’s compliance with that mandate, suggesting that officials had played fast and loose with the judge’s directives. To get to the bottom of the matter, the plaintiffs want sworn declarations from the government on the following points:\n\n1) whether any flight with individuals subject to the Proclamation took off after either the Court’s written or oral Orders were issued; 2) whether any flight with individuals subject to the Proclamation landed after either the Court’s written or oral Orders were issued; 3) whether any flight with individuals subject to the Proclamation was still in the air after either the Court’s written or oral Orders were issued; and 4) whether custody of any individuals subject to the Proclamation was transferred to a foreign country after either the Court’s written or oral Orders were issued.\n\nTo be sure, this is not the first case in which opposing parties have questioned the nascent administration’s legal compliance. To take another example in pending litigation, the plaintiffs in the foreign aid funding case that was at the Supreme Court and is back in the trial court are still casting doubt on Trump officials’ compliance there.\n\nAs for this latest situation involving flights over the weekend, we could learn soon whether Boasberg himself thinks the government defied his orders. On Monday morning, after the ACLU submitted its filing, he ordered a same-day 5 p.m. ET hearing at which the government “shall be prepared to provide answers” to the questions raised by the plaintiffs.\n\nSubscribe to the Deadline: Legal Newsletter for expert analysis on the top legal stories of the week, including updates from the Supreme Court and developments in the Trump administration’s legal cases.",

        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "Republican leaders understand that the GOP has earned a reputation for championing the interests of the wealthy, but they occasionally make the case that the party has changed.\n\nAround this time four years ago, for example, then-House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy declared, “The uniqueness of this party today is we’re the workers party.” Around the same time, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas wrote online, “The Republican Party is not the party of the country clubs, it’s the party of hardworking, blue-collar men and women.”\n\nIt’s difficult to say with confidence whether GOP leaders ever believed their own rhetoric when it came to workers’ interests, but Donald Trump continues to take steps that leave little doubt that the contemporary Republican Party is most certainly not “the workers party.” Bloomberg Law reported:\n\nPresident Donald Trump scrapped Biden-era executive orders that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 and drove federal infrastructure investments toward companies that agree to union neutrality. ... In addition to union neutrality, the now canceled EO 14126 favored companies that offer equitable compensation practices and participate in registered apprenticeships.\n\nIn case anyone needs a refresher, it was in early 2014 when Barack Obama raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour. As we discussed at the time, because government contracts can be lucrative, and so many private enterprises want federal work, the Democratic president, with a stroke of a pen, gave a raise to a whole lot of employees. The shift also sent a message to the private sector that to compete in the labor force, businesses should follow suit.\n\nRepublicans were less than pleased but faced a messaging challenge: Since most Americans support a higher minimum wage, the GOP didn’t want to be seen attacking the Democrat for doing something popular. As an alternative, Republicans pretended to be outraged that Obama advanced one of his goals by way of an executive order.\n\nRepublican Rep. Randy Weber of Texas, for example, called Obama a “Socialistic dictator” and the “Kommandant-In-Chef.” (I assume he meant “chief.”) Then-House Speaker John Boehner suggested the minimum-wage hike for contractors was unconstitutional. Ted Cruz was so incensed that he wrote an op-ed condemning the “imperial presidency of Barack Obama.”\n\nUndeterred, Biden built on the policy in 2021, raising the wage for federal contractors to $15, amid a series of related efforts to use White House power to encourage corporations that do business with the government to adopt pro-labor policies.\n\nTrump has now used his power to undo all of these Biden-era steps.\n\nThe president’s move comes four months after he appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the “Press” and faced a question about the federal minimum wage. Host Kristen Welker reminded the Republican that the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 for more than 15 years and asked whether he was prepared to raise it.\n\n“It’s a very low number,” Trump conceded, referring to the status quo. “I will agree, it’s a very low number.”\n\nAs the exchange continued, however, Trump, who has spent years offering confusing and contradictory positions on the issue, declared that he believes having a federal minimum wage doesn’t “work.”\n\nEvidently, he apparently believes raising the minimum wage for federal contractors doesn’t work, either.",

        "title": "What is an autopen, the device at the center of Trump’s attack on Biden’s pardons?",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "This is an adapted excerpt from the March 17 episode of \"José Díaz-Balart Reports.\"\n\nEarly Monday morning in a post on his social media site, President Donald Trump claimed Joe Biden’s pardons for members of the House Jan. 6 committee are invalid due to the former president’s use of an autopen:\n\nThe “Pardons” that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\n\nBefore I was a lawyer, I was a congressional aide, so I’ve used an autopen before. It’s essentially a machine set up to mimic someone’s signature exactly. It’s often used when an office holder, or someone else, has to sign so many documents that it would be impracticable for them to do so by hand.\n\nIn 2005, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department — which basically serves as the “Mother, may I?” division of the agency — clarified a president’s use of an autopen, issuing an opinion that it was within the executive's constitutional powers to sign a bill via an autopen, at their own direction.\n\n“We emphasize that we are not suggesting that the President may delegate the decision to approve and sign a bill, only that, having made this decision, he may direct a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to the bill,” the opinion states.\n\nBy extension, a president should also be able to direct that a pardon be issued under an autopen. There should be no distinction between a president’s powers to sign and authorize a piece of legislation and their pardon power. I would also argue that a president’s power with respect to pardons is actually greater than their role in signing a piece of legislation. So if it’s constitutionally valid for a president to sign a piece of legislation by autopen, there should be no impediment to them doing so with a pardon.\n\nIf it’s constitutionally valid for a president to sign a piece of legislation by autopen, there should be no impediment to them doing so with a pardon.\n\nIn that same post, Trump also claimed, without evidence, that Biden “did not know anything” about these pardons. While the Constitution does not allow a president to revoke a pardon, it appears Trump may direct his Justice Department to carry out an investigation into this matter. That means if you're one of these pardon recipients, the question now becomes: How do you prove that the then-president directed the use of an autopen to sign your pardon? The onus will fall on those who have received pardons to prove that their pardon is legitimate. That’s where this is likely headed next.",

        "title": "Mass protests against Donald Trump should remind him the people hold the power",
        "source": "https://www.msnbc.com/",
        "content": "From using the White House’s South Lawn to shill cars for his biggest campaign donor to demanding taxpayer-funded ads that claim he victoriously closed the southern border, President Donald Trump is demonstrating that, as he stated in his first term, he has “the right to do whatever I want.” That’s his twisted interpretation of Article 2 of the Constitution, which describes the power of the president.\n\nThe president of the United States is not a king. He’s not a monarch ordained by a god.\n\nYet the president of the United States is not a king. He’s not a monarch ordained by a god. As former President Barack Obama said in a “60 Minutes” interview in November 2020, the “president is a public servant.” The person elected to that office should represent and serve the public’s best interest — not his own.\n\nAs mass protests against the Trump administration take place across the nation, let us remember the historical role and responsibility of the president and what others who’ve held the office have had to say about the responsibility that comes with the position. “The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants,” former President Teddy Roosevelt wrote in a May 1918 editorial in The Kansas City Star. In 1954, former President Harry Truman said, “I would much rather be an honorable public servant and known as such than to be the richest man in the world.”\n\nThe president is supposed to serve us, the American people. Not just the people who voted for him or who donated to his campaign or inauguration — but all the people. Toward that end and in keeping with America’s long-standing policies, Trump should be working to preserve and strengthen our democratic society and democracies around the world — not undermining them by playing nice with dictators.\n\nThe American people elected Trump and have entrusted him to serve their bests interests. “Public service is a public trust,” reads Executive Order 12674 from 1989, spelling out one of the primary principles of ethical conduct for government officers and employees. President Thomas Jefferson even asserted, “When a man assumes a public trust, he should consider himself as public property.”\n\nYou just have to laugh at the idea of Trump — who wants to privatize public services from the U.S. Postal Service to education and even sell off public lands to private interests — ever considering himself public property. The absolute, fiendishly calculated chaos he has unfurled in the first weeks of his second term proves that serving the public’s best interest was never a part of his — or, let’s be honest, Project 2025’s — agenda. In that way, Trump, who has always loved flaunting his wealth, is the opposite of Truman.\n\nIn that 1918 editorial, Roosevelt asserted it was as important that the public “blame [the president] when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right … in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the nation as a whole.”\n\nThe problem is that Trump and his supporters don’t always appear to be committed to codes of ethical conduct or the law. And Trump has shown over the course of his career that he doesn’t take accountability for his actions. “Deny everything” is one of the lessons he learned from his lawyer and mentor Roy Cohn. Trump has decimated independent federal agencies likely because they are units of accountability — specifically in terms of offering oversight and regulation — in our government system of “checks and balances.”\n\nTrump has shown over the course of his career that he doesn’t take accountability for his actions.\n\nNotably, Roosevelt’s words about the president being the most important public servant were not directed to then-President Woodrow Wilson but to his fellow Americans to encourage them “to tell the truth about [the president’s] acts. … Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.”\n\nIn other words, we, the American people, are responsible to each other to secure the health of our democracy. This means we must elect to office presidents who are committed to public service, and if we fail at that, then we must use our First Amendment rights to protest against them.\n\nThey’re there to serve us, not the other way around.",

Boasberg summarized the government's position as: \"We don't care, we'll do what we want.\"\n\nIt’s not the first time the Trump administration didn’t compy with a federal court. And beyond the courts, Trump is claiming a nearly limitless power through a campaign to delegitimize institutions that have long acted on checks on the presidency. He has closed congressionally approved agencies, fired thousands of federal workers, paused legally appropriated funding for an array of federal programs and discredited universities and nonpartisan media.\n\nBut when it comes to battling the judiciary, the Trump administration could face its ultimate opponent: the Supreme Court — that is, if justices rule against administration.\n\nLegal experts expressed worry about what happens if the executive branch keeps defying court orders. Trump’s critics have no power to force him to follow a judge’s orders, and his allies have taken to frequently criticizing judges who have ruled against him and, in some cases, have called for their removal.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nMore politics news:\n\nA national NBC News poll found 49% of registered voters think DEI programs in the workplace should be eliminated , while 48% say the programs should continue.\n\n, while 48% say the programs should continue.

Justin Sullivan / Getty Images\n\nIn the eyes of some progressive Tesla owners, Elon Musk’s transformation from a CEO they perceived as “focused on the environment, sustainability and space travel,” as one person put it, to a divisive political figure in the Trump administration is off-putting. It’s so distasteful, in fact, that some are rethinking whether it’s worth keeping their electric vehicles. “Do I like representing an Elon Musk vehicle? Hell, no,” a San Diego-area Tesla owner said.

        "content": "For some hoops fans, the NCAA men’s basketball tournament is about school spirit, shocking upsets, Cinderella runs, the office bracket contest, mid-majors with funny mascots or a myriad of other happenstances that make March Madness popular.\n\nAnd for some others, the NCAA men’s basketball tournament is basically their only chance to familiarize themselves with players who will soon be performing in the NBA.\n\nThis is a tournament preview for the latter group. If you’re more curious about lottery odds than Kenpom rankings, then let’s talk about what to watch for over the next few weeks.\n\nTeam to watch: Duke Blue Devils\n\nFirst game: Friday at 2:50 p.m. ET, opponent TBD\n\nWhether your favorite NBA team blatantly tanked (the Washington Wizards) or hilariously fell apart and slid into the lottery despite lofty preseason expectations (the Philadelphia 76ers), the most important team to keep an eye on in the tourney are the Blue Devils. If you can put aside your disgust of Duke for a moment, the Blue Devils are projected by many draft experts to have three players selected in the top-10 of the upcoming NBA draft.\n\nBy now, you probably know about Cooper Flagg, the forward who is the presumptive No. 1 pick this June. Flagg was the No. 1 recruit in the high school class of 2024, and last summer he earned an invite to practice against the U.S. men’s Olympic squad as part of the Select Team. He averaged 18.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists a contest as a freshman.\n\nThe other names to know are forward Kon Knueppel, a shot-making forward whose 3-point prowess makes him attractive to pretty much any team, and Khaman Maluach, a center who can offer teams a potential defensive anchor and rim runner at the next level.\n\nTeam you wish you could watch: Rutgers Scarlet Knights\n\nNo team epitomizes the dichotomy of the college and NBA games better than the Scarlet Knights. Rutgers is expected to have two players — guard Dylan Harper and forward Ace Bailey — selected in the lottery.\n\nBoth the NBA’s and ESPN’s mock drafts have Harper going second and Bailey going third, respectively. The only problem? The Scarlet Knights missed the tournament and also declined an invitation to the NIT.\n\nAnother team with potentially multiple first-round picks: Illinois Fighting Illini\n\nFirst game: Friday at 9:45 p.m. ET, opponent TBD\n\nGuard Kasparas Jakucionis and forward Will Riley are both possible first-round selections. Jakucionis has a chance to go in the top 10, while Riley is most often projected as going final third of the first.\n\nBleacher Report’s Jonathan Wasserman describes Jakucionis as a Chauncey Billups-type guard who can thrive off the ball. Meanwhile, ESPN bills Riley as a player whose size on the wing could be an asset, though he still has room for improvement as a shooter.\n\nPlayer who could shoot his way into your heart: Tre Johnson\n\nFirst game: Wednesday at 9:10 p.m. ET vs. Xavier\n\nTexas Longhorns guard Tre Johnson is an unapologetic scorer who seems to have emerged as the fifth-best player in the upcoming draft class. Nearly every mock has a consensus top four in Flagg, Harper, Bailey and the Baylor Bears’ V.J. Edgecombe. Johnson is the player who most often pops up after them.\n\nJohnson is a gunner who is not afraid to let it fly. He can create for himself on the perimeter and seems to have NBA-ready scoring talent.\n\nThe Longhorns are no guarantee to make a tournament run, however. Texas will play in the First Four for an opportunity to make the 64-team field. A big night from Johnson could give him a March bump.\n\nEnjoy them while you can: Florida Gators, Auburn Tigers\n\nFirst game for Florida: Friday at 6:50 p.m. ET vs. No. 16 seed Norfolk State\n\nFirst game for Auburn: Thursday at 2:50 p.m. ET, opponent TBD\n\nBoth the Gators and Tigers earned No. 1 seeds in the upcoming tournament. And both squads feature players (Walter Clayton Jr. at Florida, Johni Broome at Auburn) who were semifinalists for the Naismith Trophy. But neither the Gators or Tigers have players who most mockers expect to appear in the lottery.\n\nIn fact, while Clayton Jr. and Broome both have a chance to be drafted, don’t expect to hear their names called until much later in the first round or even the second. Both Auburn and Florida have had great seasons. If you love watching the two teams play, appreciate what their stars do now, because they may not get a chance to shine as bright in the NBA.",

Alex Brandon / AP file\n\nTrump told reporters hours earlier that \"that will be something I’ll look at this afternoon\" when he was asked whether he planned to remove Hunter Biden's security detail after Biden's recent trip to South Africa.\n\nUnder federal law, former presidents and their spouses are provided security protection throughout their lives, unless they decline it. The Secret Service is also authorized to protect former presidents' children until age 16 after they leave office.\n\nHunter Biden is 55 and Ashley Biden is 43.\n\nIt is common for family members of former presidents to have Secret Service protection for a certain period. Former presidents' children often receive protection from the Secret Service for up to six months after their administrations end, but that is up to the discretion of the sitting president.\n\nJoe Biden extended security protections for his adult children until July before he left office in January. After Trump's first term ended, Biden extended protections to Trump's adult children for six months.\n\nTrump has terminated security protections for others since he took office for his second term.\n\nIn January, Trump removed Secret Service protection for Dr. Anthony Fauci, who oversaw the federal government's response to the Covid pandemic. He also yanked the security detail for John Bolton, a White House national security adviser during Trump's first term who wrote a book that criticized Trump’s leadership.\n\n“When you work for government, at some point your security detail comes off,” Trump said at the time. “And, you know, you can’t have them forever.”",

        "title": "Poll: American voters are deeply divided on DEI programs and political correctness",
        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "The issue of diversity, equity and inclusion programs is among the most tightly divided and polarizing questions in the United States at this time, with wide gaps emerging along partisan and racial lines, according to the latest national NBC News poll.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made dismantling DEI programs an early focus of his administration, and voters are split over the future of the programs in the workplace, with deep differences depending on their political party.\n\nHalf of registered voters (49%) in the NBC News poll say DEI programs should be eliminated “because they create divisions and inefficiencies in the workplace by putting too much emphasis on race and other social factors over merit, skills and experience.”\n\nAnd 48% say DEI programs in the workplace should continue “because diverse perspectives reflect our country, create innovative ideas and solutions, encourage unity and make our workplaces fair and inclusive.”\n\nAsked to share whether they have positive or negative feelings about DEI programs, a slightly higher share of voters (43%) say they have negative feelings, while 39% have positive views and 14% are neutral. (The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.)\n\nThe divides over DEI are part of a broader cultural split. In another question in the poll asking them to pick between two different statements, 51% of voters say there is “too much political correctness in our society today, and too much pressure on people to limit what they can do or say to avoid offending other people.” Meanwhile, 45% say there is “too much prejudice in our society today and people need to be more respectful in what they do and say to avoid offending other people.”\n\nTrump issued an executive order on his first day in office to end DEI programs at federal agencies, which prompted some private companies to also roll back programs focused on increasing diversity in the workplace. The Education Department has launched investigations of more than 50 colleges and universities as part of a broader push against DEI programs. The Federal Communications Commission also moved to open an inquiry into DEI practices at Comcast. (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)\n\n“When we see these heated conversations at a partisan level about DEI, it really comes down to: How are they looking at American society today? Where do they see the problems? And that’s going to lead to very different solutions and very different approaches,” said Democratic pollster Aileen Cardona-Arroyo of Hart Research Associates, which conducted the poll with Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm.\n\nBeneath the surface of the overall division in the electorate are wide gaps depending on voters’ party affiliation and race. Fully 80% of Republicans believe there is too much political correctness, while 77% of Democrats say there is too much prejudice. Independents are split, with 46% saying there is too much political correctness and 43% saying there is too much prejudice.\n\nAn overwhelming share of Republicans (85%) believe DEI programs should be eliminated, while the same share of Democrats believe they should continue. More independents side with Democrats on that question, with 59% saying DEI programs should continue and 39% saying they should be eliminated.\n\nAnd while younger people were more likely to support DEI programs than older respondents, the issue highlights another example of a wide gender gap among younger voters on politics in the Trump era.\n\nAmong women ages 18 to 49, 67% say DEI programs should continue, while 31% want to eliminate them. But among men ages 18 to 49, 40% want to continue DEI programs, while 57% say they should be eliminated. More older women support DEI programs than older men, but the gap between them is not as large.\n\n“The survey also points to there being more political intensity and salience for Republicans around these issues than there is for Democrats,” Cardona-Arroyo said, noting the overwhelmingly negative views of DEI programs from voters who make up Trump’s base, including white men without a college education, self-described MAGA Republicans and self-described conservatives.\n\nRepublican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies said that Trump’s actions on DEI and other issues such as immigration underscore the president’s near-unified support from Republicans, which has bolstered Trump’s early approval numbers.\n\n“You can see how his efforts, including on DEI, are just really echoing with his core political base,” McInturff said.\n\nThe survey also finds divisions along racial lines, with a majority of white voters saying DEI programs should end and that there is too much political correctness in society. White women with college degrees were the exception among white voters, with 59% saying there is too much prejudice and two-thirds saying DEI programs should continue.\n\nAn overwhelming share of Black voters (80%) say DEI programs should persist, and 71% say there is too much prejudice in society today. The share of Latino voters in the survey was too small to analyze the group’s overall views on the issue.\n\nThe NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

        "content": "It’s lights out for the first private lunar lander to pull off a fully successful moon mission.\n\nFirefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lander fell silent over the weekend, wrapping up two weeks of science experiments for NASA. The end came as the sun set at the moon, no longer providing energy for the lander’s solar panels.\n\n“Mission is completed,” Firefly CEO Jason Kim said via X late Sunday night. “But the Ghost still lives on in our hearts and minds for the journey it’s taken us on!”\n\nThe lander operated five hours into the lunar night as planned before it died Sunday evening. Photos of the lunar sunset and glow will be released on Tuesday, Kim said.\n\nBlue Ghost launched from Cape Canaveral in January as part of NASA’s commercial lunar delivery program. It landed at the moon’s far northeastern edge on March 2. It carried a drill, vacuum and other science and tech instruments for NASA. Firefly confirmed Monday that all 10 experiments worked.\n\nLate last week, Blue Ghost observed a total solar eclipse from the moon — a total lunar eclipse as seen from Earth.\n\nThe Texas-based Firefly became the first private company to land on the moon without falling or crashing after a string of failed missions by other companies over the past few years. Only five countries — the United States, Russia, China, India and Japan — have achieved a successful landing.\n\nA Japanese company’s lunar lander shared the SpaceX rocket ride, but took an even longer route to get to the moon. That lander from ispace is targeting an early June touchdown.\n\nAnother Texas company, Intuitive Machines, ended up sideways in a crater near the moon’s south pole earlier this month, dooming the mission. It was the second incomplete mission for Intuitive Machines. Its first lander put the U.S. back on the moon last year for the first time since the Apollo era after a less-than-perfect landing that hampered communications.\n\nFirefly is already working on its next lunar lander and striving for one moon landing a year.",

        "content": "A majority of American voters say their sympathies lie more with Ukraine than Russia in the war between the two countries. At the same time, nearly half say they think President Donald Trump favors Russia, while most of the remainder believe he favors neither, according to the new national NBC News poll.\n\nSixty-one percent of registered voters choose Ukraine when asked which of the two countries has their sympathies more, while just 2% say Russia. Another 35% say they are more sympathetic to neither side, while 2% are not sure.\n\nWhen asked where they believe Trump’s sympathies are, 49% choose Russia, 40% say they think Trump favors neither side, and 8% choose Ukraine. Another 3% say they are not sure.\n\nTrump himself has publicly adopted the idea of not favoring either side, saying in February, “If I didn’t align myself with both of them, you’d never have a deal.”\n\n“I cannot recall a moment in history when American public opinion and voters’ views of a president, as to which country they are more aligned with, have been more in conflict with each other,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey along with GOP pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.\n\nThose whose personal sympathies lie more with Ukraine are more likely to be Democrats (88% of them chose Ukraine), independents (59%) and those with higher levels of education and income. But majorities across a handful of key demographic cross-sections — gender, age and race — all backed Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia in 2022. Hispanic voters are close to evenly divided between Ukraine and “neither side.”\n\nThe key split is on political lines, with Republican and conservative-leaning voters more likely to say their sympathies lie with neither nation. Among Republicans, 57% say they favor neither side.\n\nBut there are some notable splits within the GOP. For example, 53% of college-educated Republicans say their sympathies lie more with Ukraine, while 62% of Republicans without a college degree say their sympathies lie with neither country.\n\nOn the question of how voters view Trump’s positioning on Ukraine and Russia, majorities of Democrats, independents, suburban women, voters of color and voters across all age ranges (except ages 50-64) all believe Trump is more sympathetic to Russia.\n\nAmong Republicans, 70% say Trump is not more sympathetic to either nation. Another 14% say Trump is more sympathetic to Russia, and 13% say he’s more sympathetic to Ukraine.\n\nAn early flashpoint in Trump's term\n\nTrump’s handling of the war between Ukraine and Russia has been one of the major storylines of the early months of his second term. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly pledged he would end the war quickly upon taking office, but the situation has proved to be more complicated as efforts to reach a ceasefire continue. And it’s clear America’s posture toward the two sides has changed in the new administration.\n\nWhile then-President Joe Biden heaped praise on Ukraine for defending itself against Russia’s incursion and repeatedly trumpeted new aid packages to the country, Trump has been more critical toward Ukraine, culminating in a heated confrontation between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in front of reporters in the Oval Office late last month.\n\nDuring the discussion, Trump declared that Zelenskyy was “gambling with the lives of millions of people” and had been “disrespectful” to the U.S., while Vance argued the Ukrainian president hadn’t been thankful enough for the help his country received. The episode scuttled plans to sign an agreement on mineral rights in Ukraine, and the Trump administration moved to pause intelligence sharing and aid to Ukraine in the days after the meeting, though both restarted last week after talks in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThese developments come amid a broader philosophical shift among Republicans toward Trump’s brand of “America First” foreign policy, while Democrats have pulled in the opposite direction.\n\nIn the poll, voters heard two statements and picked which one better represents their thinking: The U.S. “need to focus here at home because America cannot be the world’s policeman trying to solve all the problems and intervening in countries around the world,” or “America has not been strong enough and has allowed Russia and China to extend their influence and power throughout the world?”\n\nIn March 2022, Republicans were split: 47% chose focus here at home and 46% said America hasn’t been strong enough on the international stage.\n\nNow, 61% want America to focus here at home while 33% say it hasn’t been strong enough on the world stage. Democrats have moved in the opposite direction, from 49%-40% on focusing at home in 2022 to 57%-37% now that America hasn't been strong enough internationally.\n\nOverall, 51% of American voters prefer to focus here at home and 43% say that America hasn’t been strong enough on the world stage. That’s similar to three years ago, when 50% said focus at home and 41% said America hasn’t been strong enough on the world stage.\n\nRepublicans’ evolution on U.S. foreign policy also includes increasingly negative views of NATO over the last few years. Trump has long criticized NATO countries for not spending enough to defend the alliance and said the U.S. has been unfairly shouldering the load.\n\nIn 2022, 39% of Republicans had a positive view of the military alliance among the U.S., Canada and 30 European countries, while 22% had a negative view of it. Now, 19% view NATO positively and 46% view it negatively.\n\nViews on Ukraine, Russia and their leaders\n\nFifty-five percent of registered voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, while 42% approve of it.\n\nWhen asked to evaluate the kind of change Trump is bringing to America’s handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, 41% of registered voters say Trump is bringing the right kind of change, 34% say he is bringing the wrong kind and 22% say he isn’t bringing any change.\n\nAnd U.S. voters give Ukraine and Zelenskyy far higher positive marks than Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country. Forty-six percent of voters say they view Zelenskyy favorably and 32% view him negatively, close to the 41% who view Ukraine positively and 28% who view the country negatively.\n\nJust 6% view Russia positively and 68% view it negatively, while 3% view Putin positively and 84% view him negatively.\n\nWhile Democratic views on Zelenskyy and Ukraine have largely stayed similar since NBC News polling measured them in May 2022, Republicans have less positive views of Zelenskyy and Ukraine than they did previously. Negative views of Russia and Putin have also declined among Republicans, though positive views have not moved appreciably.\n\nA plurality of Republicans, 37%, viewed Ukraine negatively in November 2023, while 27% viewed the country positively. But the nation's lost support from the party since then, and now 46% view it negatively and 19% view it positively.\n\n“The president is creating an alignment with his own political base,” said McInturff, the Republican pollster.\n\n“You’re watching a shift,” McInturff continued. “He is dragging his own political base in terms of his current rhetoric and position.”\n\nThe NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.",

He was seen pointing toward the sea while a group of security officials kept people away from the area.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to NBC News briefly at the resort where Konanki had been staying before she disappeared, and before he was spotted by NBC News on the beach, Riibe said, “I’m just trying to help them out,” adding: “The ocean is a dangerous place.”\n\nRiibe “has been confined to the hotel since the investigation began. He is permanently escorted by the police anywhere he goes. So no, he is not free to leave,” the law firm representing him said in an email Saturday.\n\nPesqueira, the national police spokesperson, said no signs of violence were found at the beach.\n\nA hotel spokesperson said red flags — which indicate “that the sea had a strong current and very high waves” — were flying when Konanki disappeared.\n\nIn an interview last week with Dominican investigators, Riibe said he was on the beach with Konanki shortly before she disappeared.\n\nHe said they were “in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little,” according to a transcript of the interview obtained by NBC News. A wave crashed, taking them both “out to sea,” it quotes him saying.\n\n“I kept trying to get her to breathe, but that didn’t allow me to breathe all the time, and I swallowed a lot of water,” he said.\n\nRiibe said he got Konanki back to shore before she disappeared.\n\n“The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn’t hear her answer,” he said. “I looked around and didn’t see anyone. I thought she’d grabbed her things and left.”\n\nAuthorities in the Dominican Republic have said no one is considered a suspect in Konanki's disappearance.\n\nU.S. authorities have said it is a missing persons case and not a criminal matter.\n\nJesse Kirsch, Carlos Catire and Debra Jones reported from Punta Cana, Phil Helsel reported from Los Angeles.",

        "content": "TOKYO — Major League Baseball’s regular season kicked off on Tuesday with an opening pitch thrown from halfway around the world.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers won 4-1 against the Chicago Cubs in the first of a two-game series at Tokyo Dome, a 55,000-seat indoor stadium in the Japanese capital, as America’s pastime seeks a wider international audience.\n\nThere may be no more natural place for the season to begin than Japan, a baseball-crazy country whose star players have revitalized the American game.\n\nThough Major League games have been played here before, never before have they featured so many Japanese stars, including the Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani, a national hero.\n\nShohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers preparing to face the Chicago Cubs at Tokyo Dome on Tuesday. Mary DeCicco / MLB Photos via Getty Images\n\nOhtani is one of five Japanese players appearing in the games, along with Dodgers pitchers Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki, Cubs pitcher Shota Imanaga and Cubs outfielder Seiya Suzuki.\n\nThe excitement was palpable on Tuesday at Tokyo Skytree, the city’s tallest freestanding tower, where the league set up a fan experience center.\n\n“This is something worthy of being included in Japanese textbooks,” Daiki Akiyama, a fan from Osaka who described baseball as his life, told NBC News on Monday. “I’ve been so excited I haven’t slept in three days.”\n\nFood stands sold hot dogs, beer, burgers and baseball-shaped candy apples. People of all ages took their turn at batting cages, testing their skills against a screen simulation that tracked their performance.\n\nMascots from both teams came out to interact with fans, and even cardboard figures of the Japanese players drew long lines of people waiting to snap photos.\n\nFans could also take pictures with the Dodgers’ trophy from their World Series win last year.\n\nBaseball fans watching the Dodgers vs. Cubs season opener on a big screen at Tokyo Skytree on Tuesday. Dawn Liu / NBC News\n\nEven a few diehard American fans made the trip.\n\n“We’ll do anything for the Dodgers,” Richard Moreno, who traveled from L.A., told NBC News outside a merchandise store where many items had sold out.\n\nWhat makes the team so exciting?\n\n“It’s all about Ohtani. He’s our hero,” Moreno said.\n\nFans packed the stadium during practice sessions over the weekend to catch a glimpse of Ohtani, 30, who signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers in 2023 and is the reigning National League MVP.\n\nThough Ohtani is still recovering from off-season shoulder surgery, he is the Dodgers’ designated hitter as they play in Japan for the first time.\n\nOhtani said he hoped the series would “mean something to not only people in Japan but throughout all of Asia.”\n\n“Tokyo Dome is where I saw my first ballgame and I’m happy to be back here, in this situation,” he said at a news conference.\n\nEven Baseball Hall of Famer and 13-time All-Star Ken Griffey Jr. is impressed, saying there are only “certain people” he would compare Ohtani to, such as Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods.\n\n“He’s one of the guys that you stop everything you’re doing so you can see what he’s going to do... because it can be that quick,” Griffey told reporters Monday.\n\nBanners showcasing the many Japanese stars ahead of the MLB opener between the LA Dodgers and Chicago Cubs at Tokyo Dome on Tuesday. Janis Mackey Frayer / NBC News\n\nBecause Japan has basically adopted the Dodgers as its team, tickets for the Tokyo Series sold out fast, with many of the seats costing more than what some fans paid for a flight from L.A.\n\nMoreno said he was struggling to buy tickets, which cost “an arm and a leg.”\n\nStill, his companion Anthony Martinez described the trip as a “once-in-a-lifetime experience.”\n\n“I’m just kind of shocked that we’re even here,” he said.\n\nThose who couldn’t get tickets gathered at Skytree for watch parties, where Dodgers blue predominated.\n\nJapan is seen as an important market for baseball, which was introduced to the country in 1872 and is now its most popular spectator sport. Last week, Japan’s Hanshin Tigers beat both the Dodgers and the Cubs in exhibition games in a sign that America’s sport is being redefined as a global game.\n\nJanis Mackey Frayer, Dawn Liu and Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Peter Guo reported from Hong Kong.",

The podcast has thousands of positive reviews and is one of the most listened-to podcasts. It’s so popular that it’s turned the creator and host of the podcast, Alex Cooper, into a bit of a celebrity. Fans say they love how Cooper cuts through the noise and talks frankly about things that impact women. So, late last year, people were intrigued when Cooper announced she was launching a drink called Unwell Hydration.\n\nWhen she launched the line, Cooper said she created it specifically for women because she believed staying hydrated was one way that women could stay on top of the many things they juggle. It was also just announced as the official beverage of the National Women’s Soccer League.\n\nInitially, Unwell Hydration was launched exclusively at Target, but today you can also get it on Amazon. The online retailer is selling 12-packs of each of the three flavors — strawberry, mango citrus and orange hibiscus — for $25. You can learn more about the drink below.\n\nWant more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nUnwell Hydration Drink $ 25.98 Amazon What we like Good flavors\n\nFun packaging Something to note Slightly caffeinated\n\nUnwell Hydration has a catchy tagline: “For all of life’s unwell moments — girls trips, breakups, morning afters, return flights, recoveries, hangovers.” But you can drink it anytime you want extra electrolytes — like you might reach for a Gatorade or Vitamin Water. The biggest difference between those drinks and Unwell Hydration is that it contains 75 milligrams of natural green coffee extract, just under the amount of caffeine you’d get in a cup of coffee. The beverage also has 700 milligrams of electrolytes and contains a custom vitamin B blend, according to the brand. It is also free of artificial flavors and colors.\n\nThere are three flavors of Unwell Hydration currently available — strawberry, mango citrus and orange hibiscus — and one bottle of this drink is 25 calories. If you purchase the beverage on Amazon, you can buy each flavor in a pack of 12 for $24.68 and Prime members will get free shipping.\n\nWhy trust NBC Select?\n\nI’m a writer at NBC Select who covers various topics, including home, tech and beauty.

        "content": "The biological mother of the Connecticut man who was allegedly held captive and starved by his stepmother for more than two decades says she is \"proud of him\" for escaping — and his captor can \"rot in hell.\"\n\nPolice say the Connecticut man, 32, started a fire in the small room that he was allegedly locked in at his family’s Waterbury home on Feb. 17. The man, who police did not name but described as a victim, was found severely emaciated after being subjected to \"prolonged abuse, starvation, severe neglected inhumane treatment.\"\n\nHe told responding officers he was held captive by his 56-year-old stepmother, Kimberly Sullivan, since he was 11 years old, and started the fire because \"I wanted my freedom,\" the Waterbury Police Department said.\n\nThe man’s biological 52-year-old mother told NBC Connecticut on Monday she had been looking for a sign of her son for decades after giving up custody of him when he was a baby. Last week, she found out the harrowing news from her sister.\n\n\"My sister actually called me while I was at work and she had stated we found [her son]. We found him,\" the mother, who wants to remain anonymous, told NBC Connecticut.\n\n\"I’m heartbroken,\" she added. \"I still just can’t fathom it. How can anybody treat somebody like that?\"\n\nThe Connecticut man, 32, started a fire in the small room that he was allegedly locked in at his family’s Waterbury home on Feb. 17. WVIT\n\nThe mother, along with her daughter — the victim’s half-sister — said they scoured the internet for him once he became an adult.\n\n\"I just want him to know that he has a big sister, and I’ve always known he’s existed, and I’ve always loved him, and I’ve always been trying to find him. I’ve been looking for him for over a decade. I wanted to wait till he was 18. I’m almost 35 now. And … there was nothing. No social media, no court records, no ancestry information, nothing,\" the half-sister said.\n\nSullivan is facing assault, kidnapping, unlawful restraint, cruelty, and reckless endangerment charges in the case. Her attorney has denied the allegations.\n\nAt Sullivan’s arraignment, prosecutors said the stepson, who was 5-feet-9 and weighed 68 pounds when he was found, told authorities he had been locked inside an 8-by-9-foot room since the fourth grade. He told authorities he was let out in the mornings for 15 minutes to two hours to do chores and was given two sandwiches a day and the equivalent of two small bottles of water.\n\nAccording to an affidavit in the case, he ignited the fire using a lighter, hand sanitizer, and some paper from a printer.\n\nThe victim's biological mother told NBC Connecticut she is demanding charges against the family that held him in that Waterbury home.\n\n\"All of them in that home…need to get…charged, and she needs to actually spend the rest of her life in solitary confinement and fed two cups of water a day,\" she said.\n\nShe's hopeful to be connected with her biological son soon.\n\nKimberly Sullivan is accused of holding her stepson captive for 20 years and providing little water and little food. NBC Connecticut\n\n\"He does have everybody here, on both sides, on both sides of his family that love him, and have looked for him,\" the mother said. \"We all love him. I love him. He’s so strong, and I’m so proud of him for doing what he needed to do. I wish he did it sooner.\"\n\nIoannis Kaloidis, an attorney for Sullivan, told NBC News last week Sullivan is innocent of any crimes. Kaloidis said the man's biological father died in January 2024.\n\n\"I can’t disclose the specifics of my conversation with my client, but I could tell you, at the time the father passed away, this gentleman was over 30 years old. She wasn’t controlling anything in his life,\" Kaloidis said. \"She continued to maintain the home, she continued to get groceries, she continued to keep the lights on, the heat on, and provided a shelter.\"",

Detectives are searching for the 15 and 11-year-olds.\n\nScott Dwight Habermehl, 63, was riding to his job at Sandia National Laboratory early in the morning in May when he was hit by a car after it swerved into the bike lane, according to police.\n\nThe crash was filmed from inside the car and circulated on social media. In the recording, a voice believed to be the 13-year-old can be heard saying he is about to hit the bicyclist, according to law enforcement. The car appears to accelerate and a voice believed to be the 15-year-old says, “Just bump him, brah.”\n\nThe driver asks, “Like bump him?”\n\nA passenger says, “Yeah, just bump him. Go like…15…20.”\n\nLoud sounds can then be heard in the recording, including “metal flexing,” according to law enforcement.\n\nThe video was posted on social media and reported to police.

        "content": "American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt said after the hearing before Boasberg on Monday that courts make difficult, polarizing decisions all the time.\n\n“What changes here, what the difference is here, is the government’s apparent refusal to abide by the federal court’s power,\" he said. \"Our country is based on the assumption that there are three equal branches and that the federal court will say what the law is and that the other two branches will adhere to those rulings. Once that ends, we’re in a very different situation in this country; we’re no longer a country based on the rule of law.”\n\nLegal fights over immigration have put a fine point on Trump’s recalcitrance when it comes to being constrained by existing laws and norms. It is fertile political ground for him, because polling shows most Americans embrace his promises to stop illegal border crossings and deport millions of people already in the country without proper status. A majority of registered voters (55%) approve of Trump's handling of border security and immigration, according to a new NBC News poll, while 43% disapprove. It was Trump's strongest issue out of five tested in the poll.\n\nAnd his lieutenants appear to have little regard for the courts as they pursue those goals.\n\n“We’re not stopping,” White House border czar Tom Homan said Monday morning on “Fox and Friends.” “I don’t care what the judges think.”\n\nDespite the rhetoric against judges and the defiance of some rulings, the administration has also taken steps to follow the appeals process, indicating that officials are trying to maintain at least a semblance of respect for legal norms. When it has lost cases, such as over payments due to USAID contractors or the ultimately successful effort to fire a federal employee watchdog, it has immediately turned to courts of appeal and then to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut in the case of the deportations over the weekend, said Samuel Bray, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, Trump officials were in contempt of Boasberg’s order in his view.\n\n“If a court gives an order and a court has jurisdiction and the party who’s given the order has notice of the order and knows what it means, then if you disobey it, that’s contempt,” he said.\n\n“The administration’s arguments about being outside the territory of the United States and the order being oral rather than written are not good legal arguments. They are more like an attempt to work the refs as these cases go up on appeal,” Bray said. In this context, the refs in question are the nine members of the Supreme Court.\n\nFour Democratic senators rebuked Trump in a statement Monday for invoking the Alien Enemies Act, which was designed to thwart a hostile takeover of the country. The plain language of the law allows the president to execute the deportation of noncitizens in the event of “a declared war” or an invasion by “any foreign nation or government.”\n\n“Let’s be clear: we are not at war, and immigrants are not invading our country,” wrote Sens. Alex Padilla, of California, Cory Booker, of New Jersey, Dick Durbin, of Illinois, and Peter Welch, of Vermont.\n\nMahmoud Khalil stands by the gates of Columbia University on April 30, 2024. Olivia Falcigno / USA Today Network file\n\n“Furthermore, courts determine whether people have broken the law — not a president acting alone, and not immigration agents picking and choosing who gets imprisoned or deported,” the letter added. “It’s what our Constitution demands, and it’s the law Trump is bound by no matter how much he tries to mislead the American people otherwise.”\n\nBut the Democratic senators have no power to force Trump to follow a judge’s orders. In some cases, the administration is deferring to the courts — at least for now. Last week, a federal judge told the administration that it could not summarily deport Khalil, the pro-Palestinian activist at Columbia University.\n\nU.S. officials detained Khalil in New York and moved him to Louisiana, where they hope his case will be heard. The venue could be important in ultimately determining whether he is deported or can remain in the country.\n\nThe administration has repeatedly been accused of failing to follow court orders while sometimes declining to acknowledge that it had not been.\n\nThe first instance was on Feb. 10, when a federal judge in Rhode Island blasted the government for having violated his order halting a sweeping federal funding freeze.\n\n“Defendants in some cases have continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds,” U.S. District Judge McConnell wrote, even though his order lifting the freeze had been “clear and unambiguous.”\n\nA judge presiding over a case directing the government to lift a freeze on funding for grants from USAID had to issue three orders to get the government to begin complying. The government had argued it was reviewing the grants during that period, which it said it was allowed to do.\n\nIn a separate case, nonprofit groups accused the administration of working around a court order on a suspension of grants on refugee admissions by simply terminating the grants.\n\nImpeaching judges\n\nTrump allies inside and outside the administration have frequently criticized judges who have ruled against him — in some cases calling for their removal from office — including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whom Trump appointed to the Supreme Court in his first term.\n\n“I don’t say this lightly,” Mike Davis, a lawyer and Trump ally, wrote Monday on X. “But the time has come: Tell Congress to Impeach DC Obama Judge Jeb Boasberg for Keeping Terrorists in America.”\n\nRep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, said Saturday that he would file articles of impeachment against Boasberg.\n\nOther Trump advisers offered a similar sentiment, that much of what stirred controversy and pushback from critics about Trump’s overreaching is ending no time soon. There seem to be, to date, few guardrails limiting Trump’s ability to skirt court orders, and both attacks on specific judges and ignoring directives from the court are likely to become at least a somewhat familiar feature of his political and policy agenda.\n\n“If activist judges are going to block the mandate we were given, then I see no reason why it should [stop],” said Trump adviser who was granted anonymity to speak freely. “This is, as we view it, a new day. We are getting the country back on track.”",

        "content": "NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are finally coming home.\n\nThe astronauts, who had planned to visit the International Space Station for just a week but have been there more than nine months, departed early Tuesday.\n\nTheir journey back to Earth will close out an unusual and closely watched chapter in spaceflight history. Williams and Wilmore became household names after launching on the first crewed test flight of Boeing’s Starliner capsule in June. But they encountered problems with the vehicle’s thrusters while docking to the space station, which eventually led NASA to bring the Starliner back to Earth without anyone on board.\n\nThat forced Williams and Wilmore to remain in orbit for far more time than planned. But at long last, they departed the space station on Tuesday at 1:05 a.m. ET aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.\n\nThe astronauts should then splash down off the coast of Florida at 5:57 p.m. ET.Alongside them will be NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, who are wrapping up a roughly six-month mission at the space station.\n\nThe particular timing of the group’s return flight on Tuesday was decided “based on favorable conditions forecasted for the evening of Tuesday, March 18,” NASA said in a statement. (The agency previously targeted Wednesday for the journey.)\n\nThe SpaceX vehicle that the four will share arrived at the space station in September, carrying Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats to accommodate their colleagues. Williams and Wilmore then stuck around so that Hague and Gorbunov could complete their mission.\n\nThat is now ending as a new set of astronauts takes over. On Sunday, Williams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov welcomed the incoming crew — NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov — to the orbiting outpost.\n\nIn that sense, despite the attention their extraordinary circumstances have garnered, Williams and Wilmore were not “stranded” in space. Both have repeatedly challenged that characterization, maintaining that they have enjoyed their extended time living and working in low-Earth orbit.\n\n“Every day is interesting because we’re up in space and it’s a lot of fun,” Williams said in a news briefing earlier this month, but added that the waiting and uncertainty was likely hard for family members on the ground.\n\nNonetheless, their unexpectedly long stay in orbit has become a political talking point for SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Both have made unsubstantiated claims that the Biden administration held up the flight back to Earth for political reasons.\n\n“This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned Astronauts, because the Biden Administration was incapable of doing so,” Trump wrote Monday in a post on Truth Social. “They shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them.”\n\nThe SpaceX capsule carrying NASA astronauts Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore and Nick Hague and Russian astronaut Alexander Gorbunov after undocking Tuesday. NASA via AP\n\nHowever, NASA’s plan to use a SpaceX vehicle for the return journey has remained consistent since it was announced in August, during the Biden administration.After Musk made a claim similar to Trump's in a joint interview on Fox News last month, a public back-and-forth between Musk and several current and retired astronauts erupted on X. European astronaut Andreas Mogensen called Musk’s comments a “lie,” and things got ugly after Musk fired back, calling Mogensen an “idiot” and a derogatory term. Retired astronauts Scott Kelly, Mark Kelly and Chris Hadfield also waded into the online dispute.\n\nIn the recent news briefing, Williams and Wilmore carefully skirted the politics, with Wilmore saying they had “respect and admiration” for the president and “the utmost respect for Mr. Musk.”\n\nBut in response to a question about recent comments Musk made suggesting that the U.S. should abandon the International Space Station in two years rather than keep it operating through 2030 as planned, Williams voiced her disagreement.\n\n“I would say we’re actually in our prime right now,” she said. “I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.”",

        "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com/",
        "content": "A midwife in Texas has been arrested and charged with performing illegal abortions and practicing medicine without the appropriate license.\n\nKen Paxton, the state attorney general, announced the arrest, which he said Monday happened earlier this month, after an investigation by his office.\n\nAccording to Paxton, the midwife, Maria Margarita Rojas, 49, is alleged to have owned and operated three health clinics in the northwest area of Houston. In a news release, Paxton accused Rojas of performing abortions in the clinics — which are banned by law in Texas — and of employing people who falsely presented themselves as licensed medical professionals.\n\nThe case appears to be the first in which a health care provider in Texas has been criminally charged with performing an abortion since the state’s ban went into effect in 2022.\n\nThe abortion charge is considered a second-degree felony, with a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. The charge related to medical licensing is a third-degree felony.\n\nThe clinics did not comment when they were reached by phone, and Rojas did not immediately respond to inquiries. Court documents did not list a lawyer for her.\n\nThe documents show that a district judge in Waller County first granted a warrant for Rojas’ arrest on March 5, alleging criminal conspiracy to commit practicing medicine. She was booked at the Waller County Jail the following day, according to the documents, and charged March 7 with violating the Texas Occupations Code. She was later released on a $10,000 bond.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton in Leander, Texas on Jan. 7. Jay Janner / USA Today Network via Imagn\n\nOn Monday, Rojas was arrested again, this time on charges of performing an abortion and violating the state’s occupation code, the documents show. Those are alleged to have happened after Rojas’ first arrest, according to the documents.\n\nWaller County District Attorney Sean Whittmore referred the case to the attorney general’s office, the release said. Whittmore’s office told NBC News that it anticipates that the attorney general will handle the prosecution.\n\nThe Texas law that made it illegal to provide an abortion took effect shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The policy permits exceptions if a physician determines that terminating a pregnancy could save a pregnant person’s life or prevent substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\n\nPaxton has pledged to enforce the ban, which targets providers, not patients.\n\n“In Texas, life is sacred. I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state’s pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individuals endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,” he said in a statement Monday. “Texas law protecting life is clear, and we will hold those who violate it accountable.”\n\nIn December, Paxton sued a New York doctor, alleging she had prescribed abortion pills to a patient in Dallas. A Louisiana grand jury indicted the same doctor in January, saying she prescribed abortion pills — the first known instance of criminal charges’ being filed against a provider for sending the pills across state lines. That doctor did not respond to requests for comment at the time and has not spoken about the case.\n\nNew York has a so-called shield law that protects abortion providers in the state who prescribe pills to places where abortion is banned.",

        "content": "Federal prosecutors are appealing a federal judge’s ruling in Wisconsin that possessing child sexual abuse material created by artificial intelligence is in some situations protected by the Constitution.\n\nThe order and the subsequent appeal could have major implications for the future legal treatment of AI-generated child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, which has been a top concern among child safety advocates and has become a subject of at least two prosecutions in the last year. If higher courts uphold the decision, it could cut prosecutors off from successfully charging some people with the private possession of AI-generated CSAM.\n\nThe case centers on Steven Anderegg, 42, of Holmen, Wisconsin, whom the Justice Department charged in May with “producing, distributing, and possessing obscene visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct and transferring obscene material to a minor under the age of 16.”\n\nProsecutors alleged that he used an AI image generator called Stable Diffusion to create over 13,000 images depicting child sexual abuse by entering text prompts into the technology that then generated fake images depicting non-real children. (Some AI systems are also used to create explicit images of known people, but prosecutors do not claim that is what Anderegg was doing.)\n\nIn February, in response to Anderegg’s motion to dismiss the charges, U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson allowed three of the charges to move forward but threw one out, saying the First Amendment protects the possession of “virtual child pornography” in one’s home. On March 3, prosecutors appealed.\n\nIn the decision, Peterson denied Anderegg’s request to dismiss charges of distribution of an obscene image of a minor, transfer of obscene matter to a person under 16 and production of an image of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\n\nAnderegg’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nMany AI platforms have tried to prevent their tools from being used in creating such content, but some safety guardrails can easily be modified or removed, and a July study from the Internet Watch Foundation found that the amount of AI-generated CSAM posted online is increasing.\n\nThe Justice Department alleged in a news release in May that Anderegg described his image-making process in a chat with a 15-year-old boy and sent the images to the teenager. Law enforcement was alerted to Anderegg after Instagram reported his account to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the release said.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that the 2003 Protect Act, while not specifically referring to it, criminalizes AI-generated CSAM by banning “obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children.”\n\nPeterson referred to a 1969 Supreme Court ruling, Stanley v. Georgia, which said private possession of obscene material in one’s own home cannot be made a crime.\n\nThat ruling has not traditionally been applied to cases involving CSAM that includes real children, which have typically been tried under a different set of laws about the sexual exploitation of minors, such as banning the transport or sale of CSAM.",

        "content": "TOPEKA, Kansas — A gust of wind sweeps over bare soil, kicking up enough dirt and dust to cut visibility to nearly zero, and for drivers, the dust storm seems to come out of nowhere.\n\nSuch conditions resulted in a pileup on Interstate 70 last week in western Kansas involving dozens of cars and trucks that left eight people dead. Blinding dust also prompted New Mexico’s transportation department to close Interstate 25 from the Colorado border southwest to Las Vegas, New Mexico.\n\nHazy or dust-darkened skies have recalled the “Dust Bowl” of the 1930s, when millions of tons of blowing soil buried farms and coated towns across the Great Plains. Lesser storms occur every year, particularly in the western U.S., particularly when farmland hasn’t been planted yet in the spring. Some scientists worry that many motorists don’t take them seriously enough.\n\n“We have a very low level of public awareness of a dust storm and what damage it can cause,” said Daniel Tong, an associate professor of atmospheric chemistry at George Mason University who is among the authors of a 2023 paper on dust storm deaths.\n\nDust storms have a history of causing fatalities\n\nThe High Plains Museum in Goodland displays a photo of a tractor buried in blown soil in the 1930s, a reminder of the consequences of a severe drought across the Great Plains that came after farming had destroyed native grasses.\n\nThe fatalities Friday near Goodland were the first in the area in a dust storm since 2014, said Jeremy Martin, the Weather Service meteorologist in charge there.\n\nBut they came less than a month after an 11-car pileup on I-25 left three people dead, with heavy dust cited as a factor, according to Albuquerque TV’s KRQE. Similarly, a dust storm on I-55 between St. Louis and Springfield, Illinois, in 2023 led to a fatal pileup involving dozens of vehicles.\n\nIn 1991, 17 people died in an accident involving more than 100 vehicles on I-5 in California’s San Joaquin Valley, blamed on blowing dust.\n\nTong and four co-authors concluded in their paper published in 2023 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society that there were 232 deaths from “windblown dust events” from 2007 through 2017, far higher than the number recorded by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association data.\n\nThe aftermath of a pileup near Goodland, Kan., on March 14. Kansas Highway Patrol via AP\n\nIn January, he and four colleagues concluded that the economic damaged caused by wind erosion and dust is four times higher than previously calculated and more than $154 billion a year.\n\nA cold front carries dust through western Kansas\n\nMartin said a cold front moved through the area of the pileup after it had been warm and dry for six hours. Winds that reached 70 miles per hour (113 kph) kicked up dust that then became trapped in the cold front.\n\n“That’s when you get that classic wall of dust,” he said.\n\nAs blowing dust cut visibility on the road to almost zero, drivers slowed down, causing collisions, authorities said.\n\nA preliminary investigation found that 71 vehicles were involved, said Kansas Highway Patrol spokesperson April McCollum. Aerial photos showed at least 10 were semis.\n\n“It was hard to even keep your eyes open outside because there was so much dust in the air,” said Jeremy Martin, the National Weather Service meteorologist in charge in Goodland. “It kind of stung to even breathe out in it.”\n\nSimilar conditions in eastern Colorado prompted the Colorado State Patrol to warn drivers: “Zero visibility due to high winds and blowing dirt.”\n\n“You couldn’t see,” said Jerry Burkhart, the fire and emergency services chief in Lamar, Colorado. “The best thing to do is get way off the road in a parking lot or something like that.”\n\nA lack of visibility is not the only problem\n\nMartin said it’s hard to tell how thick dust is from a distance, so motorists often don’t know they won’t able to see until they’re in it.\n\nWeather Service forecasters also said some of the advice for motorists in a dust storm is counter-intuitive. Michael Anand, a NWS meteorologist in Albuquerque, said motorists should pull off the road as safely as possible, turn off all lights and never use their high beams.\n\n“You don’t want people behind you to think you’re going in the road,” Martin said. “That light from your tail light might be the only thing they can see. They’re thinking the road suddenly curves.”\n\nHigh winds make cars harder to control, and a dust storm coats the road with fine particles that slow breaking, and drivers panic, Tong said.\n\nHe said dust storms are frequent and widespread enough across the U.S. that states should test prospective drivers on what to do in a dust storm on license exams.\n\n“That could be, actually, a very easy way to educate drivers,” he said.",

It added that people were still buried under rubble, with recovery efforts underway.\n\nDr. Muneer Al-Boursh, the ministry's director-general said \"most of the victims\" were women and children as he called on Gaza's residents to donate blood.\n\nWhile Tuesday's strikes are not the first to happen during the ceasefire, their scale puts the two-month-old ceasefire on shaky ground, although neither Israel or Hamas have explicitly said they considered the current ceasefire to be over.\n\nFollow along for live coverage\n\nA woman consoles a grieving relative beside the body of a victim killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza City on Tuesday. Omar Al-Qattaa / AFP - Getty Images\n\nStill, Hamas accused Israeli officials of having violated the terms of the truce.\n\n“Netanyahu and his extremist government have decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement and are exposing the prisoners in Gaza to an unknown fate,” Hamas said in a statement.\n\nVideo captured by NBC News' crew on the ground in southern Gaza's Khan Younis showed scenes of people being rushed to Nasser Hospital, while bloodied bodies could be seen being laid down on the floor and on metal stretchers, including those of young children.\n\nDr. Tanya Haj-Hassan, a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians' emergency medical team at Nasser Hospital described the \"frenzy\" Tuesday morning as having \"felt like Armageddon.\"\n\n“The windows were shaking, the doors flew open, it was non-stop and then within about ten minutes we started hearing the sirens,\" she said in a statement shared by MAP with NBC News.\n\nGaza Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Basal said early Tuesday that dozens of people had been killed and wounded, following attacks on homes.\n\n“Our crews are unable to deal with the attacks due to limited resources and the dangerous situation,” Basal said. “We call on the world to stop this aggression.”\n\nThe Israeli military issued evacuation orders Tuesday morning to Palestinians in neighborhoods across the enclave in Beit Hanoun, Khirbet Khuza’a, Abasan al-Kabira, and al-Jadidah, saying they were \"dangerous combat zones.\" Residents were told to evacuate to known shelters in western Gaza City and Khan Younis.\n\nThe strikes were the heaviest Israeli military bombardment in Gaza since the ceasefire deal was reached in January and brought a pause to fighting that followed the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, when more than 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.",

        "content": "LOS ANGELES — A California lawmaker this week introduced legislation inspired by the viral reunion of “Oreo” the dog and his owner during the Los Angeles fires that aims to help save pets left behind during natural disasters.\n\nThe proposed law, which has been filed in the California State Assembly but is not yet publicly available for viewing, is called the FOUND (Friends of Oreo Uniting During Disasters) Act.\n\n\"The FOUND Act is something that embraces what we all understand, how important our pets are and that they are parts of our family,\" California Assemblymember Rick Zbur, who authored the bill and represents portions of Los Angeles, said in an exclusive interview with NBC News.\n\nCasey Colvin's holds his dog Oreo after they reunited on March 17, 2025. NBC Los Angeles\n\n\"This grew out of the circumstances that so many people faced trying to reunite themselves with their pets when they were evacuated throughout Southern California because of the recent wildfires,\" Zbur said. \"One of the things that we realized is that, you know, cities and towns don’t really have procedures to help people reunite with their pets.\"\n\nThe measure, AB 478, calls for local jurisdictions to include in their emergency plans a process for retrieving animals left behind during mandatory evacuations. It also seeks to have cities establish an emergency rescue hotline to help evacuees get assistance.\n\nZbur said individual counties or cities would determine specifics and could include allowing pet owners to be escorted into an evacuated area by emergency service personnel, or a designated group like a humane society or nonprofit.\n\n\"We don’t want people to basically be skirting the roadblocks,\" Zbur said. \"So if we want to protect human health and safety, we need to provide ways of people reuniting with their pet.\"\n\nZbur said the law is directly inspired by Casey Colvin and his beloved pomeranian Oreo, whose emotional reunion, captured by NBC News during the Palisades Fire, struck a chord with millions. The viral video revealed the heartbreaking reality for many fire victims separated from their pets during evacuations.\n\n\"I don’t want there to be another person sobbing on the side of the road, begging the police to let them get to their dog,\" said Colvin, who added that he hopes to testify at the state Capitol next month.\n\n\"I just want to use this moment, because, you know, 15 minutes is fleeting, that while you have the spotlight to just try to help other people,\" he said.\n\nThe bill will now work through the legislative process; if the Assembly approves it, it will move to the Senate. If approved there, it would go to the governor’s desk to be signed into law.\n\nJudie Mancuso, CEO and president of Social Companion Legislation, the animal rights advocacy group sponsoring the FOUND Act, said the law would be the first of its kind in the country and that the hope is it could be replicated nationwide to save animals not only during fires but other natural disasters like hurricanes.\n\n\"The hope is that other states will follow,\" Mancuso said. \"We have a lot of animal-loving people across the United States who consider their dogs and cats their family.\"",

        "content": "The White House has not confirmed the time of the call.\n\nTrump said late Monday that he looked forward to the call with Putin in a post on Truth Social, adding that “many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains.”\n\nThe call will most likely involve a discussion of what Ukraine will have to give up to achieve a pause after three years of fighting since Putin ordered his troops to invade Russia’s neighbor.\n\nTrump, who has been trying to win Putin’s support for a 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine accepted last week, said late Sunday that discussions with Putin would involve “dividing up certain assets” that included land and power plants.\n\nThe president has intimated that the Zaporizhzhia power plant, Europe’s biggest nuclear facility, as well as land — Ukraine controls part of the Russian region of Kursk, while Russia holds several regions of Ukraine — will be up for discussion.\n\nHe told reporters in Washington on Monday that Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region were “in deep trouble,” according to Reuters, adding that his administration’s temporary suspension of military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv was an attempt to \"get Ukraine to do the right thing.”\n\nPutin has repeatedly indicated that Russia wants to cement his country’s land grabs during the war and stop Kyiv from ever joining NATO. Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told ABC News on Sunday that the prospect of a pathway into NATO for Ukraine was “incredibly unlikely.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously stated that he would be willing to resign in exchange for peace or NATO membership, which he sees as imperative for Ukrainian security.\n\nKeir Giles, a fellow with the London-based think tank Chatham House, told NBC News that the upcoming call between the two leaders would “primarily be about meeting additional demands from Putin at the expense of Ukraine.”\n\nReferring to Trump’s comments over the division of assets, Giles said the call was “the classic Russian principle of demanding somebody else’s cake and then settling for only half of it, with those demands being enforced by an outside third party.\"",

        "content": "Our skin deals with environmental and self-inflicted obstacles every day, so the least you can do is give it some needed protection with a good face moisturizer (and, of course, sunscreen).\n\nChoosing the right face moisturizer is the most important step in building a skin care routine for dry skin.

Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter.\n\nThe best face moisturizers for dry skin in 2025\n\nBelow are the facial moisturizers our experts count as their favorites for dry skin, along with recommendations from NBC Select staff, who are skin care experts in their own right.\n\nBest overall: CeraVe Moisturizing Cream\n\nNot only is this moisturizer an NBC Select Wellness Awards winner and one of our top 10 moisturizers out of 100, but it’s also accepted by the National Eczema Association, which means it’s suitable for sensitive skin. NBC Select associate reporter Bianca Alvarez loves how effective this cream is at healing eczema on both her face and body. “Although it’s a cream, it’s very easy to spread, and a little goes a long way, so one tub will last you a long time,” she says.\n\nFormula: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, ceramides | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes\n\nDespite having different skin types, both NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin (who has acne-prone skin) and Alvarez (who has dry, sensitive and eczema-prone skin) use this as their daily morning moisturizer. “It has a medium thickness, so it’s moisturizing enough to prevent dry, flakey skin, yet thin enough that it absorbs quickly,” says Malin. “It never makes me look oily or shiny, and it never exacerbates irritation when I’m experiencing it.”\n\nAlvarez loves how gentle and soothing it is on her skin. “It’s a game changer during my eczema flare-ups because any itchiness or roughness I’m experiencing goes away in a few days,” she says. “I never want to stop using it because it’s the perfect maintenance tool for keeping my skin moisturized, calm and happy.”\n\nType: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: ceramides, glycerin, niacinamide, La Roche-Posay prebiotic thermal water | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes\n\nMalin loves using this moisturizer every morning because it helps to keep acne at bay and doesn’t cause breakouts. Courtesy Zoe Malin\n\nBest for sensitive skin: First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream\n\nThis thick, fragrance-free moisturizer combines colloidal oatmeal and allantoin, which are great for sensitive, reactive skin (including rosacea- and eczema-prone skin) since they work together to soothe redness and irritation, according to experts we spoke to. It also has shea butter, which moisturizes and protects the skin barrier, according to the brand. You can use the moisturizer, which has a 4.4-star average rating from over 10,300 reviews at Sephora, on both your face and body, making it a versatile choice. (Keep in mind the brand recalled over 2,700 jars of the Ultra Repair Cream in the coconut vanilla scent earlier this year, so we are recommending the fragrance-free option.)\n\nType: cream | Skin type: dry | Key ingredients: colloidal oatmeal, shea butter, allantoin | Fragrance-free: yes\n\nBest daily moisturizer: Vanicream Facial Moisturizer\n\nDr. Barry Goldman, a dermatologist at New York City’s Goldman Dermatology and a clinical instructor at Cornell NY Presbyterian Hospital, recommends Vanicream for dry skin, and it’s also an NBC Select staff favorite, ranking number 11 on our top 100 list. “This is one of the very few products that I will always buy again when it runs out — my skin practically craves it when it’s gone,” says NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson. The facial moisturizer is made with a blend of emollients and humectants, and it doesn’t have common irritants like dyes and fragrances, according to the brand.\n\nType: lotion | Skin type: sensitive | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin, squalane | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes\n\nBest budget-friendly: Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream\n\nGoldman and Jean Dachnowicz, a licensed aesthetician at New York City’s Goldman Dermatology, call Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream the best overall moisturizer for dry skin, and it took the number one spot on our 100 moisturizer list. “It feels thick and rich as it comes out of the jar, with an aroma barely registering on my nose. Everyone on our staff who tried this found it simple, reliable and nourishing, regardless of their skin type,” says NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz.\n\nType: cream | Skin type: sensitive, dry | Key ingredients: glycerin, niacinamide, panthenol, vitamin E | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes\n\nBest ointment: Vaseline Petroleum Jelly\n\nPetroleum jelly is the occlusive moisturizer behind the popular skin care trend “slugging” — people put the product on their face after their skin care routine to lock in moisture. The American Academy of Dermatology says that petroleum jelly products have several skin care benefits, including helping dry skin; however, both Goldman and Dachnowicz warn it may clog pores on some skin types.\n\nType: ointment | Skin type: dry, normal, sensitive | Key ingredients: petroleum jelly | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: no\n\nBest for flaky skin: Aquaphor Healing Ointment\n\nAquaphor is an occlusive moisturizer that can be helpful for skin that tends to be flaky, cracked or scaly, according to Goldman and Dachnowicz. The fragrance-free ointment, which you can use as a lip mask and hand cream in addition to a face moisturizer, includes several occlusive ingredients, like mineral oil and glycerin. Compared to lotions or creams, Aquaphor works best to create a barrier that keeps moisture in; however, Goldman and Dachnowicz warn that Aquaphor may be too heavy for some skin types and can clog pores.\n\nType: ointment | Skin type: dry, sensitive, normal | Key ingredients: glycerin | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: no\n\nBest night balm: Futurewise Slug Balm\n\nThis soothing balm, our pick for best occlusive night cream, has a jelly-like consistency that Malin loves applying to “lock everything in” at the end of her evening routine. The balm uses plant-based oils and lipids to create a layer over your skin that helps to prevent water loss and allow for better absorption of your other products, according to the brand.\n\nType: balm/jelly | Skin type: dry, sensitive, normal | Key ingredients: hydrogenated vegetable oil, citric acid | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: no\n\nBest for very dry skin: Topicals Like Butter Moisturizer\n\nThis moisturizer is made with colloidal oatmeal, which targets extreme dryness and eczema, according to the brand. It’s one of NBC Select associate SEO reporter Ashley Morris‘ go-to winter moisturizers — she says it keeps her skin feeling hydrated and plump without any excess greasiness, and soothes dry patches right away.\n\nType: lotion | Skin type: sensitive, very dry, combo | Key ingredients: colloidal oatmeal | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes\n\nBest balm: First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Rescue Skin Barrier Balm\n\nThis balm from First Aid Beauty boosts your moisture barrier using 1% dimethicone, which is a skin protectant that creates a layer which helps to relieve irritated skin, according to the brand. The addition of colloidal oatmeal gives the formula soothing properties that’s great for redness and dry patch flare-ups, and also contains glycerin, a humectant that keeps skin hydrated throughout the day.\n\nType: balm | Skin type: dry, sensitive, normal | Key ingredients: 1% dimethicone, colloidal oatmeal, glycerin | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes\n\nBest gel cream: Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer\n\nMost of our experts recommend Neutrogena’s Hydro Boost line for people with dry skin. Plus, it’s an NBC Select staff favorite: “When my skin is raw — like red, inflamed, flaky and uneven in texture — this is the only moisturizer I can tolerate,” says Malin. “I first started using it when I began treating acne with Tretinoin, which severely dried out my skin for the first few months. It was the only moisturizer I found that didn’t sting or burn when I applied it, and I used it multiple times a day. I always keep some with me wherever I go just in case my dry skin starts flaring up.”\n\nType: gel | Skin type: dry, acne-prone | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes\n\nBest for damaged skin barrier: Kiehls Ultra Facial Advanced Repair Barrier Cream\n\nAn NBC Select Wellness Awards winner for dry skin, this moisturizer has colloidal oatmeal and beta-glucan, which work together to soothe redness and repair the skin’s moisture barrier. NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio loves this thick moisturizer for the wintertime when her rosacea-prone skin is driest. “It’s super thick, and most of my dry patches disappear overnight when I use it,” she says. It is also lightweight and gentle on sensitive skin, according to the brand.\n\nType: cream | Skin type: sensitive | Key ingredients: colloidal oatmeal, beta-glucan | Fragrance-free: yes | Water-based: yes\n\nNBC Select updates editor Mili Godio loves how thick this moisturizer is and can notice a difference in how much dry patches and redness are reduced when she applies it to her skin. Courtesy Mili Godio\n\nThough it took her some time to warm up to, NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown loves the milky liquid texture of this option, which merges the hydration benefits of a cream with the lightweight feel of a toner. “It almost feels like water yet it has some weight to it that makes it look like a serum,” she says. Still, potential shoppers should be wary of how much they apply — “A little goes a long way, so you risk looking greasy when you go overboard,” says Brown.\n\nType: liquid | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: white tea leaf water | Fragrance-free: n/a | Water-based: yes\n\nBest multitasking cream: Embroylisse Lait Crème Concentré\n\nThis moisturizer is a favorite of Alvarez and NBC Select page Emma Satin because it’s thick and creamy without being greasy, heavy or sticky. “It is my go-to for New York winters when my skin needs a moisture boost, but I truly use it year-round, especially when I’m doing my makeup for a special occasion and want my skin to glow,” says Satin. “It is a bit pricier in the States but is worth every penny if you struggle with dry skin.”\n\nType: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: shea butter, beeswax, aloe vera, soy proteins | Fragrance-free: no\n\nClose to the end of her tube, Satin refuses to toss out her favorite moisturizer because she says it’s to the last drop kind of good. Courtesy Emma Satin\n\nBest for face and body: Selfmade Corrective Experience Comfort Cream\n\nThis fragrance-free moisturizer, another NBC Select Wellness Awards winner, has niacinamide and hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin. It’s also occlusive, so it creates a barrier on the skin to prevent moisture loss and improve its ability to heal, experts say. Malin finds this to be very similar to Neutrogena’s moisturizer, which is why she loves it. “I find it even more cooling, and it has aloe in it, which is super soothing when my skin is red and inflamed,” she says. “It absorbs into my skin quickly and is so lightweight I forget I’m wearing it. You can also use it as a body cream, so I’ve applied it to dry patches on my neck, chest, arms and legs as needed.”\n\nType: cream | Skin type: sensitive | Key ingredients: niacinamide, hyaluronic acid | Fragrance-free: yes\n\nBest splurge: Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream Moisturizer\n\nWhen it comes to moisturized skin, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream is the first product that comes to mind for Brown. “The texture is so rich, but it doesn’t sit on top of the skin and I just love how glowy I look and feel after applying it,” she says. The cream has a slew of hydrating ingredients, including aloe vera, hyaluronic acid and camellia oil, and is also available in a lighter, gel-cream version, which has soothing niacinamide.\n\nType: cream | Skin type: dry | Key ingredients: niacinamide, aloe vera, hyaluronic acid | Fragrance-free: n/a\n\nBest rich cream: Avène Hydrance Rich Hydrating Cream\n\nAvène Hydrance Rich Hydrating Cream $ 40.00 Amazon What we like Soothing\n\nMinimizes fine lines\n\nImproves dull skin Something to note Higher price point\n\nSmall size\n\nWhen her skin is experiencing a few breakouts but is still combatting its typical dry and eczema concerns, Alvarez reaches for this moisturizer. “My skin rarely experiences breakouts, but lately, it’s in that transition of summer heat to cooler early fall, so it’s all over the place. This cream is my saving grace,” she says. “It’s very rich and thick, but it won’t clog my pores, so my breakout isn’t worsening, and it’s alleviating those dry, somewhat rough patches I have overnight.”\n\nType: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: avène thermal spring water, shea butter, glycerin | Fragrance-free: no\n\nAlthough this isn’t fragrance-free, Alvarez says she hasn’t had any irritation or worsening of her eczema and sensitive skin symptoms. Courtesy Bianca Alvarez\n\nFor people who want a quick-absorbing moisturizer, Dr. Annie Chiu, a board-certified cosmetic and general dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute in California in Redondo Beach, recommends this one from Biossance. It has ingredients like squalane oil and probiotics to help hydrate your skin, reduce redness and shrink pores, according to the brand. “I love using this in the summer months or when I’m about to be really active because it gives me the same amount as a thick, creamy moisturizer without being heavy or potentially clogging my pores,” says Alvarez. “I usually try not to spend too much money on a moisturizer, but this is worth it and I will buy a new one every time I run out.”\n\nType: gel | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: squalane, probiotics | Fragrance-free: yes\n\nThis moisturizer is suitable for all skin types but is especially great for those with reactive, sensitive, oily and acne-prone skin, according to the brand. Courtesy Bianca Alvarez\n\nBest long-lasting: Tatcha The Dewy Skin Cream\n\nTatcha’s The Dewy Skin Cream couples antioxidant ingredients with deep moisture in an elegant, non-greasy formula, says Chiu. The cream has a blend of Okinawa algae and hyaluronic acid, which work together to restore water levels to the skin and replenish ceramides, according to the brand. Other nourishing ingredients in the moisturizer include glycerin and dimethicone.\n\nType: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: glycerin, dimethicone, hyaluronic acid | Fragrance-free: yes\n\nBest overnight treatment: Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask\n\n“I’m obsessed with Summer Fridays’ Jet Lag Mask because when I apply it, it truly feels like my skin is drinking a giant cup of water,” says Malin. “I lather it all over my skin before I go to bed once or twice a week on nights when I’m not using my acne medication — it gives me that glazed donut look I aim for when I really need to hydrate my skin.” Plus, you only need to use a little at a time since it has a rich consistency that spreads easily, says Malin. Since it does leave your skin looking very dewy and glowy, Malin recommends using it only at night.\n\nType: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: niacinamide, glycerin, hyaluronic acid | Fragrance-free: yes\n\nFor the best results, apply a thin layer all over your face, including the eye area, and leave it be for at least 10 minutes. However, unlike other masks, no rinsing is required, but you can use a warm cloth or tissue if you would like, according to the brand.

It has hyaluronic acid to hydrate the skin and ceramides and squalane to lock in moisture, according to the brand.\n\nType: lotion | Skin type: dry, damaged | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, ceramides, squalane | Fragrance-free: no\n\nMost gentle: The Outset Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer\n\nIf you have highly sensitive skin or have multiple allergies, including gluten and nuts, consider this lightweight allergy-tested moisturizer. “It’s so incredibly gentle on my skin, and instead of worsening my ongoing symptoms, it helps soothe, heal and repair them,” says Alvarez. “Seriously, all it takes is two pumps, and my skin automatically feels 10 times better and more moisturized.”\n\nType: cream | Skin type: all | Key ingredients: squalane, glycerin, avocado oil, plum oil | Fragrance-free: yes\n\nAlvarez prefers using this during her morning skin care routine but uses it at night as well when her skin is dry and experiencing a few breakouts.

During sleep, our skin loses more moisture because our body temperature slowly increases throughout the night, says Chiu. This mask has several moisturizing ingredients, including the humectant hyaluronic acid. “It also has an occlusive effect that still manages to feel light and soothing,” says Chiu.\n\nType: cream | Skin type: dry, flaky | Key ingredients: hyaluronic acid, black oat, lecithin, red seaweed | Fragrance-free: yes\n\nHow to shop for moisturizers for dry skin\n\nWhen shopping for a moisturizer for dry skin, our experts recommend considering factors like ingredients and formulation.\n\nIngredients\n\nHumectants, emollients and occlusives all work together to hydrate the skin and lock in moisture. Our experts break down these three types of ingredients below:\n\nHumectants draw water to the skin’s surface and help it retain moisture by breaking down dead skin cells, according to Chiu. Hyaluronic acid is arguably the most common (and important) humectant: It works by absorbing moisture like a sponge from the air and draws it into the skin, says Goldman and Dachnowicz. Other common humectants found in moisturizers include urea, glycerol, sorbitol, glycerin, aloe vera gel and lactic acid.\n\ndraw water to the skin’s surface and help it retain moisture by breaking down dead skin cells, according to Chiu.

Other common humectants found in moisturizers include urea, glycerol, sorbitol, glycerin, aloe vera gel and lactic acid. Emollients help soften the skin and lock in moisture. They are beneficial to dry skin when natural lipids have been depleted, says Chiu.

Common emollients include shea butter, isopropyl palmitate and colloidal oatmeal.\n\nhelp soften the skin and lock in moisture.

(Natural lipids are fatty acids that trap in moisture and soothe and moisturize the skin, experts previously told us in our guide to SPF lip balms.) Common emollients include shea butter, isopropyl palmitate and colloidal oatmeal. Occlusives create a physical barrier over the epidermis that prevents water loss and shields the skin from potential irritants. They are a good option for those with dry skin since they aid in moisture retention and skin barrier restoration, says Chiu. However, if you have acne-prone skin, occlusive ointments might clog your pores, according to Goldman and Dachnowicz. Common occlusives include waxes like beeswax and silicone, and oils like olive oil, lanolin, mineral oil and dimethicone.\n\nFormulation\n\nMoisturizers formulated for dry skin typically have a heavier, thicker texture to create a barrier on the skin, experts say. The type of formulation you choose depends on your skin’s needs:\n\nOintments are the thickest and most moisturizing formula and usually have the least amount of irritating ingredients, says Young. However, the downside to ointments is that they can typically be on the greasier side, which many try to avoid during the day, she says.\n\nare the thickest and most moisturizing formula and usually have the least amount of irritating ingredients, says Young.

Some people might need a cream in the drier wintertime but can switch to a lighter lotion during the summer, she says. Gel creams can strike a balance between moisturizing well and feeling less greasy on the skin. However, gel creams might not be moisturizing enough for those with very dry skin, says Young.\n\nFrequently asked questions What should I avoid while shopping for a dry skin moisturizer? Denatured alcohols: On skin care labels, denatured alcohol will appear as ethyl alcohol or SD alcohol. These alcohols will dry out the skin even more and draw moisture out of the skin, which can affect the skin barrier function and cause sensitivity and redness, according to Chiu. Not all alcohols are denatured alcohols, so don’t worry if you see “alcohol” on the label of a moisturizer advertised for dry skin, experts say.\n\nOn skin care labels, denatured alcohol will appear as ethyl alcohol or SD alcohol.

Exfoliants: Experts agree that exfoliants can irritate dry skin and potentially make it worse. Common exfoliating ingredients to avoid include salicylic acid and glycolic acid. What is the difference between hydration and moisture? According to Dr. Serena Mraz in our best night creams roundup, hydration is the process of adding water to your skin, while moisturizing is what happens when that moisture is locked into the skin, creating a barrier to shield from dryness. The best moisturizers will keep your skin both hydrated and moisturized, however products like hydrating serums and barrier creams can also help with combatting everyday dryness. How do you know if you have dry skin? A few indicators of dry skin include: Consistent flaking or scaliness (it can be itchy, but it doesn't have to be)\n\nA dull appearance, and accentuated fine lines and wrinkles\n\nSensitivity to products with certain ingredients like fragrance, botanicals or preservatives What is the best way to layer moisturizers with other products when you have dry skin? After cleansing, apply your moisturizer on damp skin because it will help seal in the water, according to Young. After applying your moisturizer, you can go in with other products, including sunscreen and makeup. If you have very dry skin, consider reapplying your moisturizer throughout the day because once may not be enough, says Young. What is a moisturizer, and how does it work? Moisturizers bring moisture into the skin, not just to the surface, says Chiu. Typically, they come in the form of lotions or creams, but can be gels or ointments, too. Creams provide a heavier barrier to keep your skin moisturized and are ideal for dry or sensitive skin, while lotions tend to be lighter and less greasy, making them better for normal to lightly dry skin, says Chiu. Should you used water-based moisturizers during wintertime? According to Goldman, once outdoor temperatures drop below freezing, the water in water-based moisturizers runs a risk of freezing on your skin, which could allow ice to form. This could also put you at risk for frostbite, which he says could pose “a much bigger problem” for your skin in the long run. Though this is only a risk during sub-zero temps, you can exercise caution by switching to thicker, humectant- and occlusive-heavy, or non-water based, moisturizers in cold weather. Both water- and non-water-based options are included in our roundup.\n\nMeet our experts\n\nAt NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "Palestinians in Gaza were filled with fear and frustration on Tuesday as they reeled from a wave of Israeli airstrikes on the territory.\n\nAfter two months of relative quiet during a cease-fire, the widespread explosions shaking homes and tents left Gazans with an unmistakable message: The war had returned, at least for now.\n\n“We’re back to living through this nightmare,” said Mohammed Fares, 24, who was displaced to Khan Younis in Gaza’s south after his home in Gaza City was destroyed early on in the war.\n\nOn Tuesday before sunrise, the Israeli military said it was carrying out attacks against Hamas in Gaza, and some 12 hours after they began said that they were still going on. The attacks, which hit during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, followed weeks of unsuccessful negotiations on an extension to the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said that more than 400 people had been killed. The ministry’s count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Hamas publicly announced the deaths of at least five senior officials among the group’s Gaza leadership.\n\nWhen Israel launched the strikes around 2 a.m., some people were preparing a special meal before the daily Ramadan fast, while others were jolted out of their sleep.\n\n“At the same moment, there were violent explosions everywhere,” said Yahya Masri, 29, a resident of Gaza City. “Everyone was asking, ‘What’s going on? What’s happening?’”\n\nMr. Masri said Israel had carried out some airstrikes in recent days, but the intensity of the assault on Tuesday morning reminded him of the worst moments of the war.\n\nRosalia Bollen, a spokeswoman for UNICEF, the United Nations children’s agency, who is working in Al-Mawasi, a coastal area designated as safer for civilians by Israel’s military, said she was awakened at around 2:10 a.m. by “very, very loud explosions.” She said the entire guesthouse where she was staying “was shaking violently.”\n\nMs. Bollen described an intense 15 minutes of consecutive airstrikes, followed by sporadic bombardment for the rest of the night. “Every five or six seconds there were very loud explosions, just uninterrupted,” said Ms. Bollen. “After it subsided, I could hear people yelling outside.”\n\n“Ambulances have been driving back and forth all night,” said Ms. Bollen, who emphasized that Gaza’s hospitals were collapsing and unable to accommodate the new wave of wounded people. “They don’t have antibiotics, syringes, or gauze,” she said.\n\nMahmoud Basal, spokesman in Gaza for the Palestinian Civil Defense, a rescue and emergency service, said the aftermath of the bombardment was “catastrophic.”\n\n“We are facing a very harsh reality where the massive efforts by medical teams and rescue crews do not rise to the scale of the existing disaster,” he said in a voice message on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Basal said that the high numbers of dead and injured were partly because houses were full of people who had returned to their neighborhoods during the cease-fire and were sheltering together in the few homes that remained standing. “Each house had at least 20 people inside,” he said, adding: “There are entire families that were buried under the rubble.”\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have failed to move from the first stage of the cease-fire agreement signed in January to the second stage, which calls for the end of the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that for the war to end, Hamas’s government and military wing must be dismantled, a position shared by his right-wing coalition partners in the government. Hamas has suggested it was willing to give up civilian governance of Gaza, but has firmly rejected dissolving its military wing, a critical source of its power in the enclave.\n\nThat disagreement has made Palestinians in Gaza concerned that any cease-fire would only be temporary.\n\n“We were hopeful about the cease-fire, but now we’re worried we’ll be stuck in this situation with no end,” Mr. Fares said. “We have a bad feeling.”\n\nAkram al-Satri, a 47-year-old translator from Khan Younis, said he had heard explosions in the night followed by “the screams of people and the sirens of ambulances.”\n\nMr. al-Satri said an entire family had been killed in his neighborhood of Khan Younis . “Fear is coming back full-fledged to the Gaza Strip,” he said.\n\nRawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting from Haifa, Israel.",

Then he added that he did not know any details about any offer.\n\n“What was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that process went, that’s information that we simply don’t have,” Mr. Wilmore said.\n\nDuring another news conference, William Gerstenmaier, a former top NASA official who is now one of the top managers at SpaceX, did not answer directly when asked during a news conference for details of Mr. Musk’s offer.\n\nMr. Gerstenmaier said SpaceX and NASA work cooperatively. “They came up with the option you heard described today by them, and we’re supporting that option,” he said.\n\nNASA officials have said that adding Ms. Williams and Mr. Wilmore to the space station crew and bringing them back now made the most sense with the least disruption.",

        "content": "Russia significantly stepped up its sabotage campaign over the past two years as it sought to pressure Europe and the United States to curb their support for Ukraine, according to a new study released on Tuesday.\n\nThe report, by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, is one of the first that try to quantify the scale of Moscow’s covert campaign that targeted undersea cables, warehouses and railways. It found that Russian attacks in Europe quadrupled from 2022 to 2023 and then tripled again from 2023 to 2024.\n\n“This is an important tool that the Russians are using in coordination with their conventional war in Ukraine,” said Seth G. Jones, the author of the study and a former adviser to the U.S. military. “It makes very little sense now for Russia to push troops across the border to the Baltic States or Finland. But their payback for these countries that are providing weapons is going after their companies, assassination plots against officials and threatening critical infrastructure.”\n\nAmid the push by Washington to halt the war in Ukraine, Russia has tamped down its sabotage efforts in recent weeks, according to a Western official. But experts believe the campaign against European targets could continue once governments put in place new plans to support Ukraine with weapons or peacekeepers.",

        "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency plans to eliminate its scientific research arm, firing as many as 1,155 chemists, biologists, toxicologists and other scientists, according to documents reviewed by Democrats on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\n\nThe strategy is part of large-scale layoffs, known as a “reduction in force,” being planned by the Trump administration, which is intent on shrinking the federal work force. Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the E.P.A., has said he wants to eliminate 65 percent of the agency’s budget. That would be a drastic reduction — one that experts said could hamper clean water and wastewater improvements, air quality monitoring, the cleanup of toxic industrial sites, and other parts of the agency’s mission.\n\nThe E.P.A.’s plan, which was presented to White House officials on Friday for review, calls for dissolving the agency’s largest department, the Office of Research and Development, and purging up to 75 percent of the people who work there.\n\nThe remaining staff members would be placed elsewhere within the E.P.A. “to provide increased oversight and align with administration priorities,” according to the language shared with The New York Times by staff members who work for Democrats on the House science committee.",

        "content": "In the summer of 1993, the movie “Free Willy” — about a captive killer whale that’s heroically set free — was an unexpected hit. But when word got out that the real whale who played Willy, an orca named Keiko, was dangerously sick and stuck in a tiny pool at an amusement park in Mexico City, the public was outraged. If Warner Bros. wanted to avoid a P.R. nightmare and not break the hearts of children everywhere, then it was clear: Someone had to free Keiko — or at least try.\n\nKeiko was hardly an ideal candidate for release. He’d lived in the care of humans for more than a decade, since he was a calf. He had millions of human fans but not a single orca friend. And he had missed out on uncountable lessons about how to live in the ocean — skills no trainer in the world knew how to teach.\n\n“The Good Whale” tells the story of the wildly ambitious science experiment to return Keiko to the ocean — while the world watched. An epic tale that starts in Mexico and ends in Norway, the six-episode series follows Keiko as he’s transported from country to country, each time landing in the hands of well-intentioned people who believe they know what’s best for him — people who still disagree, decades later, about whether they did the right thing.",

The ministry’s count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Hamas publicly announced the deaths of at least five senior officials among the group’s Gaza leadership.\n\nWhen Israel launched the strikes around 2 a.m., some people were preparing a special meal before the daily Ramadan fast, while others were jolted out of their sleep.\n\n“At the same moment, there were violent explosions everywhere,” said Yahya Masri, 29, a resident of Gaza City. “Everyone was asking, ‘What’s going on?

        "title": "The Deportation Rationale",
        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "President Trump’s promised immigration crackdown is here. Over the past two weeks, his administration has pushed against the limits of executive power — and surpassed them, critics say — to kick more people out of the country.\n\nThe administration has readied two facilities in Texas to again detain immigrant families, including children, my colleagues Jazmine Ulloa and Miriam Jordan reported yesterday. It invoked an arcane law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador, despite a judge’s order. It deported a kidney transplant expert who works at Brown University, also despite a judge’s order. It detained a green-card-holding leader of last year’s pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University.\n\nPresidents have not traditionally treated illegal immigration as a national security issue, but Trump says migrants pose a threat. He claims without evidence that other countries have deliberately emptied their prisons and asylums to fuel an “invasion” of the United States.\n\nToday’s newsletter examines the new rationale for the crackdown — and the way it is taking shape.\n\nStretching powers\n\nIn each of the examples above, the Trump administration has gone further, or plans to go further, than previous administrations felt they could:\n\nFamily detention: The administration has indicated that it will contest a 20-day limit on how long child migrants can be detained. Trump’s allies have long decried such limits as imposing a “catch and release” policy that forces the government to free unauthorized migrants.\n\nVenezuelan deportations: To evict migrants without a hearing, the administration cited a wartime law used most recently to intern Japanese Americans during World War II. (The United States is not at war with Venezuela.) It dispatched planeloads of migrants over the weekend despite a court order that tried to stop the deportations. White House officials argue that a judge can’t restrict the president’s national security powers, and even if one could, the order came too late. They stuck to those arguments in a court hearing.\n\nThe nephrologist’s deportation: The government deported Rasha Alawieh, a Lebanese kidney transplant expert at Brown University, over the weekend. She had a valid visa, and a court tried to block the move. The administration said that it deported her because she attended a Hezbollah leader’s funeral during a trip to Lebanon.\n\nThe student activists: The administration detained Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of pro-Palestinian protests, this month. Another student activist at Columbia, Ranjani Srinivasan, fled to Canada after immigration agents revoked her visa and showed up at her home. Supporters of Khalil and Srinivasan argue that the First Amendment protects their right to protest. But the Trump administration counters that immigrants, particularly those it deems national security threats, do not enjoy the full freedom of speech. It suggests that the activists supported a designated terrorist group, Hamas. (Read more about Khalil’s story and why he was targeted.)\n\nA proposed revival for the travel ban: During his first term, Trump repeatedly tried to ban visitors from mostly Muslim countries, citing the threat of terrorism. The courts blocked the first two attempts. But the Supreme Court eventually allowed a ban on eight countries, six of them predominantly Muslim, to remain. Last week, my colleagues Charlie Savage and Ken Bensinger reported on a plan to bring back the ban — and grow it to cover 43 countries.\n\nIn some ways, these examples continue a longstanding executive tradition: Presidents often use national security concerns to expand their powers. George W. Bush, for example, pointed to worries about another attack like Sept. 11 to detain and torture people without trial, drawing criticism from civil rights advocates.",

Roosevelt carved the continent into the American-aligned West and the Soviet-dominated East, creating spheres of influence that became the battlegrounds of the Cold War.\n\nBut talking to reporters on Air Force One while returning from Florida on Sunday night, Mr. Trump made clear that his scheduled phone conversation with Mr. Putin on Tuesday would be focused on what lands and assets Russia would retain in any cease-fire with Ukraine.\n\nHe will, in essence, be negotiating over how large a reward Russia will receive for its 11 years of open aggression against Ukraine, starting with its seizure of Crimea in 2014 and extending through the full-scale war Mr. Putin started three years ago. White House aides have made clear that Russia will certainly retain Crimea — in one of those odd twists of history, the location of the weeklong Yalta Conference in February 1945 — and strongly suggested it would get almost all of the territory it holds.",

Hundreds of thousands of assassination documents have already been revealed under a 1992 law.\n\nDuring a visit to the John F.

He did not provide additional details on what the files would include, but he has long promised to release the unredacted documents.\n\n“You got a lot of reading,” he told reporters at the Kennedy Center, the cultural and political institution that he took over nearly five weeks ago, installing himself as chairman. “I don’t believe we’re going to redact anything.”",

Measures of consumer and business confidence have plummeted and stock prices have tumbled, attributable in large part to Mr. Trump’s policies and the uncertainty they have caused.\n\n“It’s the kind of language that you use when your policy isn’t going great and you can see that it’s actively harming people,” said Sean Vanatta, a financial historian at the University of Glasgow in Scotland.\n\nThe Trump administration and its supporters argue that their goals go beyond political messaging. They say they are looking to reduce imports, bring back manufacturing jobs and “re-industrialize” the American economy. Even if doing so requires higher prices in the short run, they argue, American workers will win out in the end.\n\n“The trade-off of short-term pain for long-term gain can be very real and an important thing to pursue,” said Oren Cass, founder of American Compass, a conservative research organization that has backed many of Mr. Trump’s economic policies. “It’s actually incredibly heartening to see that we might have some political leaders who are willing to speak honestly about that.”\n\nBut even Mr. Cass was critical of the administration’s on-again, off-again approach to tariffs, which he said risked undermining the policy’s effectiveness.",

        "content": "President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia are expected to speak on Tuesday as Washington pushes for a cease-fire in Ukraine. Mr. Trump said the topics would include power plants and “dividing up” Ukrainian assets.\n\nThe call — which the Kremlin said would take place between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. local time — will be the first known conversation between the two leaders since Ukraine agreed to support a U.S.-backed monthlong cease-fire, as long as Russia does the same. While Mr. Trump has stated his desire to broker a truce as quickly as possible, Mr. Putin seems to be seeking more concessions.\n\n“Many elements of a Final Agreement have been agreed to, but much remains,” Mr. Trump wrote on Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform. He added that the war “must end NOW,” and said he was looking forward to the call with Mr. Putin.\n\nBefore the call, Mr. Putin projected confidence in a speech to Russian businesspeople. He said Western businesses that left Russia after the invasion of Ukraine and now wish to return would not be able to reacquire their assets for modest sums and would face Russian regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe cease-fire proposal on the table\n\nA week ago, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the U.S. national security adviser, sat down for talks in Saudi Arabia with a delegation led by Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov.\n\nImage The U.S. delegation, including, from left, Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, joined the Ukrainian delegation and Saudi officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, this month. Credit... Pool photo by Saul Loeb\n\nAfter more than eight hours of talks, the United States and Ukraine issued a joint statement saying that Kyiv would support the Trump administration’s proposal for a 30-day cease-fire with Russia, subject to Russia’s approval. The United States said it would immediately resume providing military aid and intelligence to Ukraine, which the Trump administration had suspended after an explosive U.S.-Ukraine meeting at the White House.\n\nThe United States and Ukraine also agreed to conclude “as soon as possible” a deal to develop Ukraine’s critical mineral resources.\n\nRussia’s stance\n\nMr. Putin has not yet agreed to halt the war that Russia began more than three years ago. He has said the idea for a cease-fire was “the right one and we definitely support it,” but laid out numerous conditions that could delay or derail any truce. That includes demands that Ukraine cease mobilizing new soldiers, training troops or importing weapons for the duration of any pause in fighting.\n\nMr. Putin also said that Russia would continue to insist on a peace deal that addressed the “original causes” of the war — signaling that he will not stop fighting until he extracts a pledge that Ukraine will not join NATO and that the alliance will reduce its presence in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n“There are questions that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to talk them through with our American colleagues and partners,” he told a news conference on Thursday, just before meeting with Steve Witkoff, who is Mr. Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East but has also been playing a role in the peace talks over Ukraine.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Witkoff told CNN that his meeting with Mr. Putin had lasted three to four hours. While he declined to share the specifics of their conversation, he said it went well and that the two sides had “narrowed the differences between them.”\n\nThe cease-fire proposal could create tension between Mr. Putin’s desires for a far-reaching victory in Ukraine and for close ties with Mr. Trump.\n\nConversation topics\n\nThe Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, declined to say what topics were on the agenda for the call.\n\nMr. Trump said on Sunday night that he expected to discuss territorial issues with Mr. Putin as well as the fate of Ukrainian power plants. He also noted that there had already been discussions about “dividing up certain assets.”\n\n“We want to see if we can bring that war to an end,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe we can. Maybe we can’t, but I think we have a very good chance.”\n\nMr. Trump did not elaborate on what he meant by assets or power plants, but his comments came on the same day Mr. Witkoff mentioned a “nuclear reactor” in an interview with CBS News.\n\nThat appeared be a reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, which Russia seized early in the war and still controls. The six-reactor plant is Europe’s largest, and its proximity to frontline fighting has long raised concerns about the risk of a radiological disaster.\n\nIt was not immediately clear, though, whether any discussion about the power plant would focus on Russia giving it up — or finding a way to keep it under any truce.\n\nThe power plant sits near the Dnipro River in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region, which Russia has officially annexed despite controlling only part of its territory. Surrendering it would mean ceding territory Russia considers its own. It would also give Kyiv’s troops a foothold in a Russian-controlled area that has been relatively protected from Ukrainian attacks thanks to the natural barrier of the large Dnipro River.\n\nAt the same time, energy experts say, the nuclear plant is in poor condition after three years of war and restoring full operations would require a lot of time and investment from Russia. That could mean Russia might see an incentive to try trading it in negotiations for something else, such as the easing of Western sanctions on the Russian economy, experts say.\n\nState of the war\n\nRussian advances Russian-claimed advances Ukrainian-held territory Russia has pushed Ukrainian forces almost entirely out of the Kursk region of Russia. RUSSIA Korenevo Glushkovo Snagost Sudzha Guyevo UKRAINE Detail UKRAINE Sumy 5 miles Russian advances Russian-claimed advances Ukrainian-held territory RUSSIA Russia has pushed Ukrainian forces almost entirely out of the Kursk region of Russia. Glushkovo Snagost Sudzha Guyevo UKRAINE Detail Sumy UKRAINE 5 miles\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has accused Mr. Putin of stalling so that Russia’s army can advance on the battlefield and strengthen his hand in cease-fire talks.\n\nMoscow’s push to drive out Ukrainian troops from most of the Kursk region of Russia in recent days has deprived Kyiv of an important bargaining chip in any potential negotiations.\n\nThe moves in Kursk give Russia an opportunity to show Mr. Trump that it holds the momentum on the battlefield. And battlefield maps compiled by both Russian and Western groups analyzing combat footage and satellite images show that Russian forces have already crossed into Ukraine’s Sumy region from Kursk, in what analysts say may be an effort to flank and encircle the remaining Ukrainian troops in Kursk or open a new front in the war.\n\nMr. Zelensky has accused Russia to preparing to mount a larger offensive into the Sumy region, which is home to hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nDespite the setbacks in Kursk, Kyiv’s forces have stalled a Russian offensive in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine and started to win back small patches of land, according to military analysts and Ukrainian soldiers. Military analysts, however, have been debating whether, after more than 15 months on the offensive, Russian brigades are exhausted or are regrouping for a renewed push.\n\nRecent U.S.-Ukraine tensions\n\nSince taking office, Mr. Trump has realigned American foreign policy seemingly in Russia’s favor — including by echoing a Kremlin talking point that blamed Kyiv for starting the war.\n\nThat raised alarm in Ukraine about whether Mr. Trump would taper the flow of U.S. military assistance. Strain in the relationship burst into public view on Feb. 28, when Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Mr. Zelensky in the Oval Office, saying he was not grateful enough for U.S. support.\n\nSince then, Ukraine has sought to smooth over relations with the Trump administration, and Mr. Zelensky has repeatedly expressed gratitude for American assistance.\n\nImage President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at the White House last month. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nConcessions and guarantees\n\nMr. Rubio has said that Ukraine would have to make concessions over land that Russia had taken since 2014 as part of any agreement to end the war. But he also said that it would be imperative in talks with Moscow to determine what Russia was willing to concede.\n\nBefore agreeing to the cease-fire proposal, Ukraine had insisted that any cease-fire include security guarantees, but there has been no indication since that any such guarantees would be provided before any interim cease-fire would take effect.\n\nEuropean allies have pledged further support to Kyiv. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain has said he would continue pressing Mr. Trump for American security guarantees — a lobbying effort that he shares with President Emmanuel Macron of France. Britain and France have already pledged to contribute troops to a peacekeeping force and are trying to enlist other countries across Europe to do the same.",

        "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/",
        "content": "Palestinians in Gaza were filled with fear and frustration on Tuesday as they reeled from a wave of Israeli airstrikes on the territory.\n\nAfter two months of relative quiet during a cease-fire, the widespread explosions shaking homes and tents left Gazans with an unmistakable message: The war had returned, at least for now.\n\n“We’re back to living through this nightmare,” said Mohammed Fares, 24, who was displaced to Khan Younis in Gaza’s south after his home in Gaza City was destroyed early on in the war.\n\nOn Tuesday before sunrise, the Israeli military said it was carrying out attacks against Hamas in Gaza, and some 12 hours after they began said that they were still going on. The attacks, which hit during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, followed weeks of unsuccessful negotiations on an extension to the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said that more than 400 people had been killed. The ministry’s count does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Hamas publicly announced the deaths of at least five senior officials among the group’s Gaza leadership.\n\nWhen Israel launched the strikes around 2 a.m., some people were preparing a special meal before the daily Ramadan fast, while others were jolted out of their sleep.\n\n“At the same moment, there were violent explosions everywhere,” said Yahya Masri, 29, a resident of Gaza City. “Everyone was asking, ‘What’s going on? What’s happening?’”\n\nMr. Masri said Israel had carried out some airstrikes in recent days, but the intensity of the assault on Tuesday morning reminded him of the worst moments of the war.\n\nRosalia Bollen, a spokeswoman for UNICEF, the United Nations children’s agency, who is working in Al-Mawasi, a coastal area designated as safer for civilians by Israel’s military, said she was awakened at around 2:10 a.m. by “very, very loud explosions.” She said the entire guesthouse where she was staying “was shaking violently.”\n\nMs. Bollen described an intense 15 minutes of consecutive airstrikes, followed by sporadic bombardment for the rest of the night. “Every five or six seconds there were very loud explosions, just uninterrupted,” said Ms. Bollen. “After it subsided, I could hear people yelling outside.”\n\n“Ambulances have been driving back and forth all night,” said Ms. Bollen, who emphasized that Gaza’s hospitals were collapsing and unable to accommodate the new wave of wounded people. “They don’t have antibiotics, syringes, or gauze,” she said.\n\nMahmoud Basal, spokesman in Gaza for the Palestinian Civil Defense, a rescue and emergency service, said the aftermath of the bombardment was “catastrophic.”\n\n“We are facing a very harsh reality where the massive efforts by medical teams and rescue crews do not rise to the scale of the existing disaster,” he said in a voice message on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Basal said that the high numbers of dead and injured were partly because houses were full of people who had returned to their neighborhoods during the cease-fire and were sheltering together in the few homes that remained standing. “Each house had at least 20 people inside,” he said, adding: “There are entire families that were buried under the rubble.”\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have failed to move from the first stage of the cease-fire agreement signed in January to the second stage, which calls for the end of the war and a complete Israeli withdrawal.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that for the war to end, Hamas’s government and military wing must be dismantled, a position shared by his right-wing coalition partners in the government. Hamas has suggested it was willing to give up civilian governance of Gaza, but has firmly rejected dissolving its military wing, a critical source of its power in the enclave.\n\nThat disagreement has made Palestinians in Gaza concerned that any cease-fire would only be temporary.\n\n“We were hopeful about the cease-fire, but now we’re worried we’ll be stuck in this situation with no end,” Mr. Fares said. “We have a bad feeling.”\n\nAkram al-Satri, a 47-year-old translator from Khan Younis, said he had heard explosions in the night followed by “the screams of people and the sirens of ambulances.”\n\nMr. al-Satri said an entire family had been killed in his neighborhood of Khan Younis . “Fear is coming back full-fledged to the Gaza Strip,” he said.\n\nRawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting from Haifa, Israel.",

Shares in CK Hutchison, which is controlled by one of Hong Kong’s richest people, Li Ka-shing, fell nearly 3 percent on Tuesday after Mr. Lee’s comments. The company has canceled press and investor briefings that were scheduled for this week when it releases its latest financial report. Hutchison did not respond to requests for comment.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Hundreds of people protested at Tesla dealerships across the US over the weekend, as the backlash against Elon Musk and the Trump administration continued despite a warning from the attorney general that the government would be “coming after” protesters.\n\nThe protests, in cities including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston and New York, have come as Musk has seen his net worth plunge and the sales of Teslas plummet in Europe. In Brooklyn, New York, about 50 people gathered outside a Tesla showroom on Saturday afternoon to loudly make their displeasure clear, the fourth such protest in the last four weeks.\n\nOther anti-Tesla actions have seen bullets fired through a dealership window and molotov cocktails thrown at a charging station. But this was a rather more genteel protest, as evidenced by the signs on show. “Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,” read one, channeling a poem by the American poet James Russell Lowell.\n\nOne banner said: “Musk is too brusque,” another: “Very uncool.” One sign, however, offered a more prosaic example of the anger on display, riffing on a Dead Kennedys song: “Nazi trucks fuck off.”\n\nAs protesters chanted: “Hands off our data,” and “Arrest Elon Musk,” there certainly seemed to be plenty of support from passersby. People in cars and trucks repeatedly blasted their horns – including, at one point, a man driving a Tesla.\n\n“This is probably the most consequential moment in US history since, I don’t know, the civil war. I don’t know what to liken it to, but we’re on a precipice, and so I can’t actually concentrate on anything right now except protesting,” said Kirsten Hassenfeld, a 53-year-old artist and editor who lives in Brooklyn.\n\n“I think there are people that haven’t woken up to this yet, but I think that we’re sliding into a full-on authoritarian state. I’m terrified,” she said.\n\nMusk has witnessed a mass sell-off of Teslas in recent weeks, in protest against his unprecedented intrusion into the US government through the so-called “department of government efficiency”. Sales of new vehicles have declined around the world, with February sales in Australia down about 72% compared with the same month in 2024; in Germany sales were down 76% for the same period, while Tesla’s stock price has lost almost half its value since December.\n\nAs protests have grown, the White House has rallied round Musk. Last week Donald Trump claimed the boycott was “illegal”, while Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said on Friday she would launch an investigation into vandalism against Tesla vehicles and showrooms.\n\n“If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re coming after you. And if you’re funding this, we’re coming after you. We’re going to find out who you are,” Bondi told Fox Business.\n\nIn Brooklyn, people were apparently undeterred by the threat. Teslas driving past the protest were treated to a volley of boos, and lusty chants of “Sell your Tesla”. The demonstration certainly appeared to have restricted the number of people entering the dealership: the Guardian counted three customers in the space of an hour and a half.\n\nDonna C, who asked not to give her last name, said it was her fourth time protesting at that dealership.\n\n“It’s important for me because Elon Musk has carte blanche to destroy our country, destroy our democracy, destroy the institutions that millions of New Yorkers and millions of Americans rely on. Donald Trump has allowed him to buy his way into the government with hundreds of millions of dollars of contributions,” Donna said.\n\n“I think what these protests are doing is opening the eyes of Americans in their millions across the US to what is actually going on,” she said. “My parents grew up in fascism in Italy under Mussolini. I’ve seen what can happen. We know the history, the same steps are being taken.”\n\nNearly 20 Tesla showrooms and charging stations have seen deliberate fires set over the past few weeks, while dozens of owners have had their cars variously egged, used as receptacles for dog feces, or coated with Kraft cheese singles. The protests on Saturday seem to have largely remained calm, however, despite the anger of those attending.\n\n“I’ve been pissed off and furious for a while, and a friend of mine told me, ‘If you want to come and scream and shout at Tesla, then show up on Saturday,’” said Yedon Thonden, 57.\n\n“Tesla is a good target. You know, their stock prices are sinking. Their leadership is cashing out their investments. And I think Elon is obviously worried about his company,” she said.\n\n“I think that this administration is going to realize pretty quickly that the economy is tanking. So the more we can highlight that, the better.”",

        "content": "Ireland’s taoiseach has denounced anti-immigration comments made by Conor McGregor as the MMA fighter visited the White House before a St Patrick’s Day meeting with Donald Trump.\n\nMcGregor said “Ireland is on the cusp of losing its Irishness” and that an “illegal immigration racket” was “running ravage on the country”.\n\nLast week, Donald Trump singled out “Conor” – who last year was found liable for sexual assault after a civil trial – as one of his favourite Irish people.\n\nDressed in a green business suit to mark Ireland’s national day, McGregor was at the White House at Trump’s invitation and participated in an impromptu Q&A session with reporters. “There are rural towns in Ireland that have been overrun in one swoop,” he said, speaking in the White House briefing room alongside the president’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.\n\nThe 36-year-old former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) champion said he was “here to raise the issue and highlight it” and that he would be listening to Trump on immigration – one of the president’s main areas of focus as he seeks to ramp up deportations of people in the US without proper documentation.\n\nThe apparently off-the-cuff comments were immediately condemned by Micheál Martin, the taoiseach. “Conor McGregor’s remarks are wrong, and do not reflect the spirit of St Patrick’s Day, or the views of the people of Ireland,” the Irish prime minister said on X. “St Patrick’s Day around the world is a day rooted in community, humanity, friendship and fellowship.”\n\nView image in fullscreen President Donald Trump with Conor McGregor at the White House. Photograph: x/@whitehouse\n\nMcGregor was among those at an official pre-inauguration party in Washington in January. He has been one of the biggest stars of the UFC, which was founded by the Trump ally Dana White.\n\nIn November McGregor was ordered by an Irish civil court to pay nearly €250,000 (£210,000) in damages to a woman who said he “brutally raped and battered” her in a hotel in Dublin in 2018. McGregor claimed they had consensual sex and is appealing against the verdict with a hearing in Dublin’s high court due later this week.\n\nThe fighter has said he is considering running for president in Ireland later this year, a prospect some thought would be ruled out after the civil trial verdict.\n\nHe has been supported by figures including the self-styled misogynist influencer Andrew Tate and anti-immigration campaigners in Ireland whose reach has been turbocharged by Elon Musk retweets.\n\nImmigration is a hot topic in Ireland with many arrivals entering Northern Ireland on ferries or planes and crossing the invisible border on the island to enter the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe justice minister, Jim O’Callaghan, has promised to clamp down on those who are not entitled to international protection. Last month he said more than 80% of applications for asylum in January were rejected in the first instance.",

        "title": "John Roberts made Trump’s authoritarianism possible. He could still save his own legacy | Steven Greenhouse",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "John Roberts, chief justice of the US supreme court, should be very worried about how history will regard him. Roberts sees himself as a cautious conservative committed to protecting our institutions, but it increasingly looks as if history will view him very differently – as a deeply flawed chief justice who paved the way for the US to become an authoritarian state.\n\nRoberts can’t possibly want to be viewed that way. But it is inarguable that several decisions he played a huge role in – most notably Citizens United and last year’s startling ruling that gave presidents far-reaching immunity from prosecution – helped lay the groundwork for Donald Trump’s increasingly authoritarian presidency. How could Roberts not realize that the immunity decision he authored would embolden Trump to violate law after law and act like an authoritarian?\n\nEver since Roberts became chief justice in 2005, two of his main objectives have been clear: to boost corporate America and to help Republicans consolidate power. Roberts didn’t seem to mind that several of his key court rulings, especially Citizens United, were turning the US into a plutocracy, with the rich and corporations having huge, undue power. But he must feel very uncomfortable that second-term Trump is quickly transforming the US into an authoritarian state, as Trump and Elon Musk steamroll the constitution and federal law while the president seeks retribution against perceived enemies and fails to fully comply with several judicial decisions.\n\nCitizens United and several rulings that flowed from it – rulings that let corporations and wealthy individuals spend unlimited money on political campaigns – have played a key role in enabling Trump, in a mere few weeks, to create the most authoritarian presidency in US history. Thanks to those rulings, Musk was able to give more than $250m to help elect Trump and with that money, seemingly purchase unprecedented power by becoming Trump’s unelected chief operating officer and hatchet man.\n\nCitizens United was dangerously myopic. Not only did it fail to see that income inequality was rapidly worsening, but also failed to foresee that super-rich individuals would someday give gargantuan amounts – like Musk’s $250m-plus and Miriam Adelson’s $100m – that would go far to overwhelm the voices of average Americans. What’s more, having the world’s richest man at his side has supercharged Trump’s ability to act in authoritarian ways. Republicans in Congress have grown terrified of opposing Trump, whether on his stabbing Ukraine in the back, his wholesale firings of federal employees or his trashing agencies that Congress funded, because they know that Musk can singlehandedly bankroll a primary challenge against them (and use his X account, with more than 200 million followers, to pummel them and sic the mob on them).\n\nLast July, in another dangerously myopic decision, Roberts shocked the legal world with his broad presidential immunity ruling. In that case, Trump v United States, Roberts was so eager not to hamstring a president’s powers that his majority decision gave huge immunity to presidents when they take actions that would normally be seen as breaking the law. Roberts even laid out a roadmap for presidents to pretty much do whatever they want without having to fear prosecution – just consult with your attorney general before taking an action to ensure it is viewed as an official action and therefore qualifies for immunity, no matter how much it violates the law.\n\nCitizens United has played a key role in enabling Trump to create the most authoritarian presidency in US history\n\nRoberts’ immunity ruling – which clashed with the desire of the framers of the constitution to constrain undue executive power, like George III’s – is blowing up in the chief justice’s face. The ruling gave presidents a bright green light to flout myriad laws, and Trump seems delighted to speed through that light by, for instance, failing to comply with several judges’ rulings. If Roberts wasn’t so short-sighted, he might have realized that it was perilous to issue an expansive immunity ruling just months before the authoritarian-minded Trump might win a second term.\n\nThere are other Roberts decisions that have helped fuel authoritarianism. In Rucho v Common Cause, he wrote that the court couldn’t do anything about egregious, anti-majoritarian gerrymanders that might, for instance, let parties that receive less than 50% of the vote control state legislatures. Last year, Roberts led the way in preventing Colorado from kicking Trump off the ballot. In doing so he blatantly ignored the 14th amendment’s specific language that says no one should hold any civil office of the United States if they “shall have engaged in insurrection”, as Trump did in orchestrating the January 6 assault on the Capitol.\n\nHopefully, Roberts realizes that some Roberts court rulings have helped Trump feel unbound and emboldened the president to fancy himself as king and invoke Napoleon’s I-can-do-anything-I-want statement: “He who saves his country does not violate any law.”\n\nCrucially for Roberts and the nation, it might not be too late for the chief justice to do something meaningful to rescue his legacy, and our democracy. But doing something might not be easy because of the rightwing’s 6-3 supreme court supermajority and because Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas seem eager to serve as Trump’s lap dogs.\n\nIn a hopeful sign, Roberts recently showed some discomfort with Trump’s riding roughshod over the constitution and Congress’s spending powers: he voted to block Trump from halting $2bn in foreign aid.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘There are four important things that Roberts should seek to do as soon as possible to limit Trump’s headlong rush to authoritarianism.’ Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA\n\nThat was promising, but there are four far more important things that Roberts should seek to do as soon as possible to limit Trump’s headlong rush to authoritarianism.\n\nFirst, Roberts should lead the court in ruling that Trump egregiously violates the constitution and Congress’s Article I spending powers whenever he suddenly freezes spending that Congress has approved and whenever he shuts down agencies, like the Agency for International Development (USAid), that Congress created.\n\nSecond, Roberts has hinted he would overturn a unanimous 1935 ruling, Humphrey’s Executor, which says that presidents can’t fire members of congressionally created independent agencies. Opponents of that ruling want to give Trump the power to fire anyone in any agency – not just the National Labor Relations Board and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where he fired board members, but even inspectors general who investigate agency fraud and abuses. By now Roberts should realize it would be a big mistake to overturn Humphrey’s Executor because that would speed up Trump’s efforts to build a top-down, you-had-better-listen-to-me authoritarian state. Letting Trump fire agency officials and inspectors general at will would mean that they’d be replaced by partisan yes men who would do whatever Trump wants. Trump might, for instance, order agencies like the NLRB or EEOC to bring charges against corporations he views as enemies.\n\nThird, Roberts needs to rein in Citizens United. Let’s hope that by now, even Roberts can see that Citizens United and its progeny have seriously undermined our democracy, that allowing billionaires to pour as much as they want into campaigns is anathema for democracy. Roberts should rush to invite several cases in which states have enacted limits on out-of-control campaign contributions, and then he should get the court to craft some sane campaign contribution limits to prevent the super-rich from warping and dominating our political system.\n\nLastly, Roberts needs to find a way to limit last year’s alarmingly broad immunity decision, which many legal commentators say was poorly reasoned and did a terrible job explaining which presidential actions are immune from prosecution and which aren’t. Roberts’ immunity decision has evidently made Trump feel he needn’t worry about being prosecuted if he were to violate federal law by, perhaps, taking a bribe to pardon certain criminals.\n\nThis is a very dangerous time for America’s democracy. Taking these actions would go far to rein in Trump’s authoritarian tendencies and make him think twice before violating the law. Not only that: these actions might make history look more kindly upon the myopic chief justice.",

        "content": "Name: Bathroom divorce.\n\nAge: New – although tensions may have been simmering for years …\n\nAppearance: Two sinks, two mirrors, two toilets.\n\nThat’s what my bathroom looks like when I’m drunk. It is, in effect, two bathrooms – one for each half of a married couple.\n\nOne whole bathroom per person? This is a thing? This is very much a thing.\n\nTo what end? To maintain marital harmony. It’s like a sleep divorce, but for bathrooms.\n\nWhat’s a sleep divorce? When married couples sleep in separate bedrooms, granting each other peace and privacy. The bathroom divorce has similar aims.\n\nIs there a word for having a bathroom divorce and a sleep divorce at the same time? I think that’s just called a divorce.\n\nIn any case, these sound like redecoration projects for boomers with too much money. A bathroom divorce can certainly be expensive.\n\nHow expensive? The interior designer Debbie Wiener spent more than $100,000 on a bathroom with side-by-side sinks, as well as separate his-and-hers toilets for her Maryland home.\n\nWhy did she bother with all that? “As you get older, your gastrointestinal needs change,” Wiener told the New York Post. “My husband’s habits didn’t age well. One toilet was not cutting it.”\n\nDebbie seems quite fond of oversharing. She has a ready audience: “All my neighbours lined up to see my bathroom,” she said. “Every time I tell a woman about my bathroom, she is, like: ‘OMG, I want that!’”\n\nSo are most bathroom divorces female-driven? Seems likely. “I don’t think about the bathroom that much,” said Wiener’s husband, Jim Weinberger. “The bathroom is not a huge part of my life.”\n\nSo did Wiener invent the bathroom divorce? While her en suite makeover attracted widespread attention, it’s likely the trend was already in place. In September, House Beautiful magazine was offering two-sink design ideas aimed at preventing bathroom divorce.\n\nSo it’s not a true bathroom divorce until you get separate toilets? Honestly, the trend is so new that the rules are still being written.\n\nIs there such a thing as a kitchen-table divorce? Yes – but this refers to a bespoke separation agreement, allowing couples to divorce on their own terms, without getting lawyers involved.\n\nI was thinking more of a divider arrangement, so I didn’t have to watch my partner eat. Maybe you can start your own trend.\n\nDo say: “For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, subject to any changes in your gastrointestinal needs.”\n\nDon’t say: “Have you thought about a postcode divorce? My husband and I tried one and now we’re happily married to other people.”",

Photograph: Sébastien St-Jean/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe discovery came after local officials were forced into a U-turn, launching a large search operation after initially suggesting that it would be too costly to examine the refuse, much of which was buried under tonnes of clay.\n\nThe remains of a third victim, Rebecca Contois, a member of Crane River First Nation, were found in a dumpster near Skibicki’s home in 2022.\n\nInvestigators are still trying to locate the remains of Skibecki’s fourth victim, an unidentified woman known as Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe (Buffalo Woman).\n\nPolice first suggested in 2022 that the some of the victim’s bodies were buried in the landfill, but said that any recovery would be too challenging, prompting disbelief and outrage from family members.\n\n“They keep saying it comes down to feasibility. But it doesn’t come down to feasibility when it’s about human beings and bringing these people home,” Cambria Harris, Morgan’s daughter, said at the time. After meeting with former prime minister Justin Trudeau, she was blunt: “I told him these women need to be found, and they need to come home.\n\nThe province’s former Progressive Conservative premier Heather Stefanson nonetheless defended the decision not to search the landfill in 2023.\n\n“My heart goes out to the families.

Kinew’s party won a majority government and last year, the federal government pledged C$40m to search for the victims.\n\nWhen the positive identification of Harris’s remains were first announced, Kinew praised the family members as “having been the people who called us to our better nature and to do the right thing”.\n\nExcavation began at the privately run landfill in December, with teams sorting through nearly 20,300 cubic metres of material with rakes and by hand.\n\nAn enormous steel heated building was also constructed to allow teams to sift though wet material by hand while outside temperatures hovered at about -20C.\n\nOf the 45 search technicians hired, including family liaisons, a forensic anthropologist, a health and safety officer, and a director of operations, half are Indigenous.\n\nKinew said: “The effort itself is a microcosm of where we’re at as a country … people from different walks of life coming together to try to do the right thing for these families.”",

        "content": "Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since the second world war, granting himself sweeping powers under a centuries-old law to deport people associated with a Venezuelan gang. Hours later, a federal judge halted deportations under the US president’s order.\n\nThe act is a sweeping wartime authority that allows noncitizens to be deported without being given the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nTrump’s proclamation on Saturday identified Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang as an invading force. US district judge James Boasberg blocked anyone from being deported under the proclamation for two weeks and scheduled a Friday hearing to consider arguments.\n\nWhat are the origins of the act? In 1798, with the US preparing for what it believed would be a war with France, Congress passed a series of laws that increased the federal government’s reach. Amid worries that immigrants could sympathise with the French, the Alien Enemies Act was created to give the president wide powers to imprison and deport noncitizens in time of war. Since then, the act has been used just three times: during the war of 1812, the first world war and the second world war. During the second world war, with anti-foreigner fears sweeping the country, it was part of the legal rationale for mass internment of people of German, Italian and Japanese ancestry. An estimated 120,000 people with Japanese heritage, including those with US citizenship, were incarcerated during the war.\n\nWhy is Trump using it now? For years, Trump and his allies have argued that America is facing an “invasion” of people arriving illegally. In his inaugural address, Trump said the act would be a key tool in his immigration crackdown. “By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil,” he said. “As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions.” In his declaration on Saturday, Trump said Tren de Aragua “is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States”. He said the gang was engaged in “irregular warfare” against the US at the direction of the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro. Last month, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua and seven other Latin American crime organizations as “foreign terrorist organizations”.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration claimed to a federal judge on Monday that it did not recall deportation flights of hundreds of suspected Venezuelan gang members over the weekend despite his specific instructions because that was not expressly included in the formal written order issued afterwards.\n\nThe administration also said that even if James Boasberg, the chief US district judge in Washington, had included that instruction in his formal order, his authority to compel the planes to return disappeared the moment the planes entered international airspace.\n\nThe extraordinary arguments suggested the White House took advantage of its own perceived uncertainty with a federal court order to do as it pleased, testing the limits of the judicial system to hold to account an administration set on circumventing adverse rulings.\n\nAn incredulous Boasberg at one stage asked the administration: “Isn’t then the better course to return the planes to the United States and figure out what to do, than say: ‘We don’t care; we’ll do what we want’?”\n\nThe showdown between the administration and the judge reached a crescendo over the weekend after the US president secretly invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport, without normal due process, Venezuelans over age 14 who the government says belong to the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nThe underlying basis for Trump to invoke the statute is unclear because it historically requires the president to identify a state adversary, and Boasberg on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order blocking deportations of five Venezuelans who had filed suit against the government.\n\nAt an emergency hearing on Saturday evening, Boasberg extended his injunction to block the deportation of all Venezuelan migrants using Alien Enemies Act authority, and told the administration that any deportation flights already in the air needed to be recalled.\n\nBy the time of the hearing, two flights had already taken off and a third flight left after Boasberg issued his ruling. All three flights landed in El Salvador, where the deportees were taken to a special maximum security prison, after Boasberg issued his written order.\n\nThe Trump administration claimed at a hearing on Monday that it believed it had complied with the written order issued by Boasberg, which did not include his verbal instructions for any flights already departed to return to the US.\n\n“Oral statements are not injunctions and the written orders always supersede whatever may have been stated in the record,” Abhishek Kambli, the deputy assistant attorney general for the justice department’s civil division, argued for the administration.\n\nThe judge appeared unimpressed by that contention. “You felt that you could disregard it because it wasn’t in the written order. That’s your first argument? The idea that because my written order was pithier so it could be disregarded, that’s one heck of a stretch,” Boasberg said.\n\nThe administration also suggested that even if Boasberg had included the directive in his written order, by the time he had granted the temporary restraining order, the deportation flights were outside of the judge’s jurisdiction.\n\nThe judge expressed similar skepticism at the second argument, noting that federal judges still have authority over US government officials who make the decisions about the planes, even if the planes themselves were outside of US airspace.\n\n“The problem is the equitable power of United States courts is not so limited,” Boasberg said. “It’s not a question that the plane was or was not in US airspace.” Boasberg added. “My equitable powers are pretty clear that they do not lapse at the airspace’s edge.”\n\nAt times, the Trump administration appeared to touch on a separate but related position that the judge’s authority to block the deportations clashed with Trump’s authority to direct US military forces and foreign relations without review by the courts.\n\nBoasberg expressed doubt at the strength of that argument, as well as Kambli’s separate claim that he could not provide more details about when the deportation flights took off and how many flights left the US on Saturday, before and possibly after his order.\n\nKambli said he was not authorized to provide those details on account of national security concerns, even in private, to the judge himself. Asked whether the information was classified, Kambli demurred. Boasberg ordered the government to provide him with more information by noon on Tuesday.\n\nThe statements offered by the administration in federal district court in Washington offered a more legally refined version of public statements from White House officials about the possibility that they had defied a court order.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted on Monday that the administration acted within “the bounds of immigration law in this country” and said the Trump team did not believe a verbal order carried the same legal weight as a written order.\n\nBut the White House’s “border czar” Tom Homan offered greater defiance at the court order and told Fox News in an interview that the court order came too late for Boasberg to have jurisdiction over the matter, saying: “I don’t care what the judges think.”",

        "content": "A Canadian entrepreneur and actor in the American Pie movie franchise said she was detained for almost two weeks in “inhumane” conditions by US border authorities over an incomplete visa.\n\nJasmine Mooney, an actor who is also co-founder of the beverage brand Holy! Water, was detained on 3 March in San Diego, California.\n\nThe 35-year-old Canadian citizen’s work visa to the US was reportedly revoked back in November while traveling from Vancouver to Los Angeles, and she was attempting to file a new application.\n\n“Every single guard that sees me is like, ‘What are you doing here? I don’t understand. You’re Canadian. How are you here?’” Mooney said in an interview with ABC 10 last week from the Arizona immigration detention center where she was being held.\n\nHer mother, Alexis Eagles, who lives in British Columbia, says Mooney was detained at the San Ysidro border crossing between Mexico and San Diego, the busiest land border crossing in the world, on 3 March with an incomplete application for a work visa. Eagles told the Vancouver Sun that instead of sending her daughter to Canada or advising her to fix her application, US Customs and Border Protection officers arrested her.\n\nView image in fullscreen Vehicles queue at the San Ysidro border crossing between Mexico and the US, in Tijuana, Mexico, this month. Photograph: Aimee Melo/Reuters\n\nMooney had not been charged with any crime and does not have a prior criminal record.\n\nShe spent three nights in the detention centre, then was transferred. “We eventually learned that about 30 people, including Jasmine, were removed from their cells at 3am and transferred to the San Luis detention center in Arizona,” Eagles said.\n\n“They are housed together in a single concrete cell with no natural light, fluorescent lights that are never turned off, no mats, no blankets, and limited bathroom facilities.”\n\nEvery time Mooney was transferred, she was handcuffed and in chains, Eagles claimed.\n\nMooney told ABC 10 that she was appalled by the conditions inside the private detention facility in San Luis where she was being kept.\n\n“I have never in my life seen anything so inhumane,” she said. “I was put in a cell, and I had to sleep on a mat with no blanket, no pillow, with an aluminum foil wrapped over my body like a dead body for two and a half days.”\n\nMooney was profiled in BC Business magazine in 2019 for her work in the hospitality industry. According to the profile, she moved from the Yukon to Vancouver in 2008 to study at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. From there, she went to acting school, before owning and operating a bar.\n\nShe has said she had a three-year US work visa, which her mother said was revoked as she attempted to travel back to Los Angeles, where she was living, after a holiday in Canada. It was unclear why Mooney’s earlier visa was revoked, or why she was at the southern border this month. However, she told ABC she got her first visa at the San Ysidro border crossing on the advice of a Los Angeles attorney, who met her at the border, and therefore may have thought it would work a second time at that location.\n\nThe Guardian contacted US Customs and Border Protection for comment.\n\nMooney was released over the weekend and landed at Vancouver international airport shortly after midnight on Saturday morning.\n\n“I’m still, to be honest, really processing everything,” Mooney told reporters who were waiting for her at the airport’s international arrivals area.\n\n“I haven’t slept in a while and haven’t eaten proper food in a while, so I’m just really going through the motions,” she told CTV News.\n\n“Thank you for all your messages of support. I’m sorry if I haven’t been able to respond to everyone – just got home after what felt like escaping a deeply disturbing psychological experiment,” she added in a post on her Instagram account.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration has removed the former surgeon general Vivek Murthy’s advisory on gun violence as a public health issue from the US Department of Health and Human Services’ website. This move was made to comply with Donald Trump’s executive order to protect second amendment rights, a White House official told the Guardian.\n\nThe “firearm violence in America” page, where the advisory had been posted, was filled with data and information about the ripple effects of shootings, the prevalence of firearm suicides and the number of American children and adolescents who have been shot and killed. Now, when someone reaches the site they will be met with a “page not found” message.\n\nWhen it was originally released last summer, Murthy’s advisory was met with praise from violence prevention and research groups, and was lambasted by second amendment law centers and advocacy groups that argued the Biden administration was using public health as a cloak to push forward more gun control.\n\n“This is an extension of the Biden Administration’s war on law-abiding gun owners. America has a crime problem caused by criminals,” the National Rifle Association (NRA) said in a statement posted to X on 25 July 2024.\n\nBut Daniel Semenza, a firearm violence researcher with Rutgers University, argues that talking about gun violence through a public health lens is meant to “bring the heat down” about a deeply politicized issue and broaden what prevention can look like.\n\nIn 2023, nearly 47,000 people died by firearms, most of them suicides.\n\n“When people read gun violence is a public health problem, they read guns are a public health problem,” Semenza said. “This idea actually removes the politics from the issue and is an engine to get us on the same page. [The removal] feels like an unnecessary and mean-spirited way to politicize something that people have actively been trying to bring people together on.”\n\nThe removal of Murthy’s advisory and the rest of the information on the page is one of the thousands of pieces of health information and research removed from federal websites. They include information about vaccines, health risks among youth and gender-based violence, the New York Times reported.\n\nSome of these pages have been restored following a court order, and it is unclear whether the removal of the “firearm violence in America” will see the same fate.\n\nIn response to the Guardian’s question about the removal of webpages, the White House said: “Illegal violence of any sort is a crime issue, and as he again made clear during his recent speech at the Department of Justice, President Trump is committed to Making America Safe Again by empowering law enforcement to uphold law and order.”\n\nWhile researchers and violence prevention advocates have described gun violence – including both suicides and homicides – as a public health issue for more than a decade, it is only recently that this language has entered mainstream discourse. Experts across the field of violence prevention argue that this updated lens is meant to reflect the widespread impacts of shootings on entire communities and offer solutions to violence beyond law enforcement and firearm restrictions and policy.\n\nThis new framing has also led to more dollars from federal government offices, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, for research that could illuminate preventive methods. These efforts were supercharged with the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, passed in June 2022, which allocated millions of dollars for research into the unseen consequences of shootings. It also allowed researchers to evaluate groups that are working on the ground in the nation’s most underserved communities where shootings happen most.\n\nIf this work does not continue or is severely pared down, years of progress and gun violence status as a public health is at risk of being lost, Semenza said.\n\n“The vernacular of gun violence as a public health issue that has shaped in the last five to 10 years of research and advocacy is under direct threat,” he said. “I’m really disheartened and sad to hear about it. But it’s not because I’m surprised. This is a clear example of this administration pulling the wool over people’s eyes and being disingenuous about the things that harm people who are most vulnerable.”",

In fact, based upon their association with TdA, the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose. It demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.” Despite family members of some of the deported Venezuelans insisting their relatives were not in any gang, Cerna argued all of the deportees had specifically been identified as part of Tren de Aragua, members of which Donald Trump has said should be removed under the Alien Enemies Act. “ICE did not simply rely on social media posts, photographs of the alien displaying gang-related hand gestures, or tattoos alone,” Cerna wrote.

The relatives deny that they belong to the gang or any other violent group. From the Post’s story: The four friends grew up within blocks of each other in Venezuela, playing soccer and bouncing between one another’s homes. As the nation deteriorated, they journeyed to the United States and were eking out a new life in Dallas, where they worked long hours and shared a townhouse.

On Saturday, the Guardian reported that US army Maj Gen Charles Calvin Rogers’s Medal of Honor webpage led to a “404” error message – and that the URL had been changed, with the word “medal” changed to “deimedal”. Rogers, who died in 1990, served in the Vietnam war, where he was wounded three times while leading the defense of a base. Then president Richard Nixon awarded him the Medal of Honor, the country’s highest military honor, in 1970, making him the highest-ranking African American to receive it, according to the West Virginia military hall of fame. On Saturday, the webpage honoring him was no longer functional, with a “404 – Page Not Found” message appearing along with the note: “The page you are looking for might have been moved, renamed, or may be temporarily unavailable.” Pentagon restores webpage for Black Medal of Honor winner but defends DEI purge Read more Share Updated at 09.26 EDT\n\n3h ago 07.27 EDT Doge breaks into US Institute of Peace building after White House guts board The Trump administration fired most of the board of the US Institute of Peace (USIP) and sent its new leader into the Washington DC headquarters of the independent organization on Monday in its latest effort targeting agencies tied to foreign assistance work. The remaining three members of the group’s board – defense secretary Pete Hegseth, secretary of state Marco Rubio and national defense university president Peter Garvin – fired president and CEO, George Moose, on Friday, according to a document obtained by the Associated Press. An executive order that Donald Trump signed last month targeted the organization, which was created by Congress more than 40 years ago, and others for reductions. Current USIP employees said staffers from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” entered the building despite protests that the institute is not part of the executive branch.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there was already a “certain understanding” between the two leaders, based on a phone call they held on 12 February and on subsequent high-level contacts between the two countries. “But there are also a large number of questions regarding the further normalisation of our bilateral relations, and a settlement on Ukraine.

Trump presided over the center’s board meeting in a demonstration of his takeover of an institution that has long enjoyed bipartisan support in Washington, Reuters reported. Trump, a former real estate executive, criticised an expansive addition built on the Kennedy Center complex for lacking windows and suggested closing it. He said the center would improve physically over time, however, and he encouraged people to attend shows there. “This represents a very important part of DC, and actually our country,” he said when asked why he was making time to come to the Kennedy Center with so many other things on his plate. “I think it’s important to make sure that our country is in good shape and is represented well.” Last month, Trump became chair of the Kennedy Center after pushing out billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein. He fired its longtime president, Deborah Rutter, and installed his former ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, as interim president. Share Updated at 09.06 EDT",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The Trump administration claimed to a federal judge on Monday that it did not recall deportation flights of hundreds of suspected Venezuelan gang members over the weekend despite his specific instructions because that was not expressly included in the formal written order issued afterwards.\n\nThe administration also said that even if James Boasberg, the chief US district judge in Washington, had included that instruction in his formal order, his authority to compel the planes to return disappeared the moment the planes entered international airspace.\n\nThe extraordinary arguments suggested the White House took advantage of its own perceived uncertainty with a federal court order to do as it pleased, testing the limits of the judicial system to hold to account an administration set on circumventing adverse rulings.\n\nAn incredulous Boasberg at one stage asked the administration: “Isn’t then the better course to return the planes to the United States and figure out what to do, than say: ‘We don’t care; we’ll do what we want’?”\n\nThe showdown between the administration and the judge reached a crescendo over the weekend after the US president secretly invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport, without normal due process, Venezuelans over age 14 who the government says belong to the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nThe underlying basis for Trump to invoke the statute is unclear because it historically requires the president to identify a state adversary, and Boasberg on Saturday issued a temporary restraining order blocking deportations of five Venezuelans who had filed suit against the government.\n\nAt an emergency hearing on Saturday evening, Boasberg extended his injunction to block the deportation of all Venezuelan migrants using Alien Enemies Act authority, and told the administration that any deportation flights already in the air needed to be recalled.\n\nBy the time of the hearing, two flights had already taken off and a third flight left after Boasberg issued his ruling. All three flights landed in El Salvador, where the deportees were taken to a special maximum security prison, after Boasberg issued his written order.\n\nThe Trump administration claimed at a hearing on Monday that it believed it had complied with the written order issued by Boasberg, which did not include his verbal instructions for any flights already departed to return to the US.\n\n“Oral statements are not injunctions and the written orders always supersede whatever may have been stated in the record,” Abhishek Kambli, the deputy assistant attorney general for the justice department’s civil division, argued for the administration.\n\nThe judge appeared unimpressed by that contention. “You felt that you could disregard it because it wasn’t in the written order. That’s your first argument? The idea that because my written order was pithier so it could be disregarded, that’s one heck of a stretch,” Boasberg said.\n\nThe administration also suggested that even if Boasberg had included the directive in his written order, by the time he had granted the temporary restraining order, the deportation flights were outside of the judge’s jurisdiction.\n\nThe judge expressed similar skepticism at the second argument, noting that federal judges still have authority over US government officials who make the decisions about the planes, even if the planes themselves were outside of US airspace.\n\n“The problem is the equitable power of United States courts is not so limited,” Boasberg said. “It’s not a question that the plane was or was not in US airspace.” Boasberg added. “My equitable powers are pretty clear that they do not lapse at the airspace’s edge.”\n\nAt times, the Trump administration appeared to touch on a separate but related position that the judge’s authority to block the deportations clashed with Trump’s authority to direct US military forces and foreign relations without review by the courts.\n\nBoasberg expressed doubt at the strength of that argument, as well as Kambli’s separate claim that he could not provide more details about when the deportation flights took off and how many flights left the US on Saturday, before and possibly after his order.\n\nKambli said he was not authorized to provide those details on account of national security concerns, even in private, to the judge himself. Asked whether the information was classified, Kambli demurred. Boasberg ordered the government to provide him with more information by noon on Tuesday.\n\nThe statements offered by the administration in federal district court in Washington offered a more legally refined version of public statements from White House officials about the possibility that they had defied a court order.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted on Monday that the administration acted within “the bounds of immigration law in this country” and said the Trump team did not believe a verbal order carried the same legal weight as a written order.\n\nBut the White House’s “border czar” Tom Homan offered greater defiance at the court order and told Fox News in an interview that the court order came too late for Boasberg to have jurisdiction over the matter, saying: “I don’t care what the judges think.”",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Donald Trump is poised to reshape the US judiciary over the next four years through hundreds of potential appointments of rightwing judges, a progressive advocacy group has warned.\n\nThe analysis by Demand Justice comes with the courts already facing extraordinary pressure. The Trump administration has suffered several legal setbacks and was accused of violating a judge’s order by deporting about 250 Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador.\n\nTrump, a Republican, appointed 226 judges to the federal courts during his first term as president. The total was narrowly eclipsed by his successor, the Democrat Joe Biden, with 228 including record numbers of women and people of colour.\n\nBut Demand Justice shared data with the Guardian identifying more than 300 potential judicial appointment opportunities for Trump to radically shift the balance of the courts back in his favour.\n\nThis figure includes 54 existing and known future judicial vacancies across the country that are currently without a nominee.\n\nThen there are federal judges with lifetime appointments who can opt for “senior status” upon meeting certain age and service requirements. This allows them to reduce their workload while continuing to receive their full salary. If a judge takes senior status, it creates a new judicial vacancy that the current president can fill.\n\nDemand Justice identified nearly 250 judges – more than a quarter of all active judges – who will become eligible for senior status by the end of 2028. These include more than 60 on the powerful circuit courts. With the supreme court picking just a few cases to decide every year, it notes, circuit court judges often have the last word.\n\nDemand Justice warns that Trump’s wave of judicial nominees would cement an extreme agenda through lifetime appointments of judges whose qualifications centre on their willingness to gut Medicaid, privatise social security, shred environmental protections, eliminate veterans’ benefits and demonstrate loyalty to the president.\n\nLast week, for example, Trump lavished praise on Aileen Cannon, a judge in Florida who repeatedly ruled in his favour during a case in which he was accused of mishandling classified documents. “Actually, she was brilliant, she moved quickly,” he said in a highly unorthodox speech at the justice department. “She was the absolute model of what a judge should be, and she was strong and tough.”\n\nDemand Justice is launching trackers to monitor existing judicial vacancies without nominees, all circuit and district court judges who are or will become eligible for senior status by 2028, and the appointing party of all active circuit court judges. It is building an interactive map detailing which party has appointed the most judges on each of the 13 federal courts of appeals and the federal district courts below them.\n\nBut the threat comes amid concerns that the Democratic party has not yet found a coherent strategy to combat Trump and his assault on constitutional guardrails. The party reached an all-time low in popularity in the latest national NBC News poll, with just over a quarter of registered voters saying they have positive views of the party.\n\nMaggie Jo Buchanan, interim executive director of Demand Justice, said: “While the Trump administration and its Republican enablers in Congress bear the overwhelming responsibility for this unfolding constitutional crisis, Demand Justice will continue to firmly assert that every elected official is obligated to protect our judiciary from and safeguard our democracy against a rightwing takeover.\n\n“The American people deserve courageous leaders who will stand up and fight for our fundamental values – even when they’re in the minority and the odds are stacked against them. Silence and half-measures in response to this brazen assault on our democratic institutions are unacceptable. The time for bold, unwavering action is now.”",

Photograph: Márton Mónus/Reuters Prime minister Viktor Orbán’s government says it has never supported the parade. In recent years it has been gradually rolling back on LGBTQ rights in the name of “child protection”. The legislation – drafted by Orbán’s governing Fidesz-KDNP coalition – aims to ban the Pride march on the basis that it infringes on Hungary’s much-criticised “child protection” law, making it possible to fine those who attend the event. AFP explained the law stipulates that it is “forbidden to hold an assembly in violation of” a 2021 law that bans the “promotion and display” of homosexuality to minors. The law governing the rights of assembly is also amended, saying that only events “respecting the right of children to proper physical, mental and moral development may take place”. Organisers or participants of a banned event could risk fines of up to 500 euros ($545), with police being allowed to use facial recognition tools to identify potential offenders, AFP noted. The bill – submitted on Monday morning and fast-tracked under an exceptional procedure – passed the 199-seat National Assembly with 136 voting in favour and 27 against. Deputies of the right-wing Jobbik and the far-right Our Homeland party also supported the measure.

The US Agency for Global Media stopped grants over the weekend to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), which was founded during the cold war and broadcasts to 23 countries, including Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Iran and Afghanistan. Elon Musk, the tech billionaire tasked by Donald Trump with slashing the US federal government, called for the media group to be shut down last month, describing it as “just radical left crazy people talking to themselves”. In the last hour, the Czech Europe minister Martin Dvořák posted a joint statement signed by representatives of 10 EU countries – Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden – registering their “deep concern” over the broadcaster’s situation. The Czech government has been most vocal on the issue as RFE/RL’s offices are based in Prague. The letter read: We express our deep concern over the financial challenges currently faced by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), as reported in recent news. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has played a vital role in providing independent, unbiased, and fact-based information to citizens, particularly in regions where freedom of the press is under threat. Throughout the Cold War, it served as a crucial source of trustworthy news for audiences behind the Iron Curtain, playing a key role in many of our countries’ histories. Today, RFE/RL continues to provide trusted, independent news to tens of millions in regions where free press is restricted or absent. In doing so, it helps to promote democratic values and strengthens our collective response to disinformation and authoritarian propaganda. This vital work builds on its historic role as a force for democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression – values at the core of the European Union. By countering foreign malign influence and reinforcing democratic resilience, RFE/RL contributes to safeguarding European security and its elimination would be a gift to Europe’s adversaries. In light of this situation, we declare our readiness to work together to find and secure appropriate financial resources that will allow RFE/RL to continue its important mission. European funding would ensure the stability of this key media institution and enable it to carry on providing critical and independent reporting. We call on the relevant European institutions and member states to join forces in establishing sustainable financial support for RFE/RL and other independent media, thereby safeguarding media freedom and democracy in Europe and beyond. On Monday, the EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister, who was born in the Soviet Union, said Radio Free Europe “has been a beacon of democracy”, alluding to it as a source of information in her younger years. “Now the question for us is, can we come in with our funding to fill the void that the US is leaving? The answer to that question is … not automatically,” she said adding that the EU would “see what we can do”.

Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters Bloomberg reported (£) that Putin was expected to demand a suspension of all weapons deliveries to Ukraine – including US and European aid – during a ceasefire proposed by Trump. Europe is likely to be uneasy about agreeing to this condition, as the UK and European Union are ramping up efforts to deliver fresh military aid packages to Kyiv as soon as possible. The Russian leader has also renewed calls for broader negotiations on a long-term settlement to the war. His demands are likely to include the demilitarisation of Ukraine, an end to western military aid and a commitment to keeping Kyiv out of Nato. Before the talk, Trump said Russian and US negotiators had already talked about “dividing up certain assets”. “We’re doing pretty well, I think, with Russia,” Trump said on Sunday, adding that he thought there was a very good chance of reaching a ceasefire. Kyiv will be alarmed by Trump’s hints that the US may put pressure on Ukraine to cede significant territory. “I think we’ll be talking about land, it’s a lot of land,” he said. “It’s a lot different than it was before the war, as you know. We’ll be talking about land,” Trump said when asked about Ukrainian concessions. “We’ll be talking about power plants,” apparently referring to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear site in Europe. Trump’s rhetoric on dividing territory has echoes of the 1945 Yalta conference, where Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt divided Europe between the American-aligned west and the Soviet-controlled east. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quick to dismiss such comparisons on Tuesday, stating that global restructuring and a “new Yalta” were not on the agenda. The US outlet Semafor reported on Monday that the White House was considering officially recognising Crimea – annexed by Moscow in 2014 – as Russian territory as part of a potential peace deal. Washington is also reportedly discussing the possibility of putting pressure on the UN to follow suit.

View image in fullscreen This picture released by the Vatican Press Office shows Pope Francis concelebrating a mass inside his private chapel at the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic in Rome on Sunday. Photograph: AP The letter was written on 14 March but made public ahead of the critical call between Russian president Vladimir Putin and US president Donald Trump. The pope said that war “only devastates communities and the environment, without offering solutions to conflicts” and that “diplomacy and international organisations are in need of new vitality and credibility”. It was written from Rome’s Gemelli hospital, where the pontiff was admitted more than a month ago with pneumonia in both lungs. He stressed the importance of communication in resolving conflict. “We must disarm words, to disarm minds and disarm the Earth”. He added: “There is a great need for reflection, calmness, and an awareness of complexity. Religions, moreover, can draw from the spirituality of peoples to rekindle the desire for fraternity and justice, the hope for peace. All this requires commitment, work, silence, and words.” For weeks, Francis, 88, was in a critical condition but has been steadily improving over the past week, although it is unclear when he’ll be discharged from hospital. Amid speculation that he could soon resign, the Vatican’s secretary of state, Pietro Parolin, said on Monday that the pontiff is “absolutely not” quitting due to his health.

        "content": "A Canadian entrepreneur and actor in the American Pie movie franchise said she was detained for almost two weeks in “inhumane” conditions by US border authorities over an incomplete visa.\n\nJasmine Mooney, an actor who is also co-founder of the beverage brand Holy! Water, was detained on 3 March in San Diego, California.\n\nThe 35-year-old Canadian citizen’s work visa to the US was reportedly revoked back in November while traveling from Vancouver to Los Angeles, and she was attempting to file a new application.\n\n“Every single guard that sees me is like, ‘What are you doing here? I don’t understand. You’re Canadian. How are you here?’” Mooney said in an interview with ABC 10 last week from the Arizona immigration detention center where she was being held.\n\nHer mother, Alexis Eagles, who lives in British Columbia, says Mooney was detained at the San Ysidro border crossing between Mexico and San Diego, the busiest land border crossing in the world, on 3 March with an incomplete application for a work visa. Eagles told the Vancouver Sun that instead of sending her daughter to Canada or advising her to fix her application, US Customs and Border Protection officers arrested her.\n\nView image in fullscreen Vehicles queue at the San Ysidro border crossing between Mexico and the US, in Tijuana, Mexico, this month. Photograph: Aimee Melo/Reuters\n\nMooney had not been charged with any crime and does not have a prior criminal record.\n\nShe spent three nights in the detention centre, then was transferred. “We eventually learned that about 30 people, including Jasmine, were removed from their cells at 3am and transferred to the San Luis detention center in Arizona,” Eagles said.\n\n“They are housed together in a single concrete cell with no natural light, fluorescent lights that are never turned off, no mats, no blankets, and limited bathroom facilities.”\n\nEvery time Mooney was transferred, she was handcuffed and in chains, Eagles claimed.\n\nMooney told ABC 10 that she was appalled by the conditions inside the private detention facility in San Luis where she was being kept.\n\n“I have never in my life seen anything so inhumane,” she said. “I was put in a cell, and I had to sleep on a mat with no blanket, no pillow, with an aluminum foil wrapped over my body like a dead body for two and a half days.”\n\nMooney was profiled in BC Business magazine in 2019 for her work in the hospitality industry. According to the profile, she moved from the Yukon to Vancouver in 2008 to study at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. From there, she went to acting school, before owning and operating a bar.\n\nShe has said she had a three-year US work visa, which her mother said was revoked as she attempted to travel back to Los Angeles, where she was living, after a holiday in Canada. It was unclear why Mooney’s earlier visa was revoked, or why she was at the southern border this month. However, she told ABC she got her first visa at the San Ysidro border crossing on the advice of a Los Angeles attorney, who met her at the border, and therefore may have thought it would work a second time at that location.\n\nThe Guardian contacted US Customs and Border Protection for comment.\n\nMooney was released over the weekend and landed at Vancouver international airport shortly after midnight on Saturday morning.\n\n“I’m still, to be honest, really processing everything,” Mooney told reporters who were waiting for her at the airport’s international arrivals area.\n\n“I haven’t slept in a while and haven’t eaten proper food in a while, so I’m just really going through the motions,” she told CTV News.\n\n“Thank you for all your messages of support. I’m sorry if I haven’t been able to respond to everyone – just got home after what felt like escaping a deeply disturbing psychological experiment,” she added in a post on her Instagram account.",

        "title": "Melania Trump shows no interest in her homeland Slovenia – for that I am thankful | Ana Schnabl",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "Slovenia is a small country and not just in physical size or because it has a population of 2.1 million. It has no real geopolitical status: it doesn’t shape the foreign policy or economy of other nations, but it is shaped by them. There is a prevailing belief in Slovenia, therefore, that we should focus on our soft power. Exceptional Slovenians will pull the country out of anonymity, putting the country on the map or securing recognition through their merit, this view holds.\n\nThis is why the achievements of basketball players Goran Dragić and Luka Dončić, professional cyclist Tadej Pogačar’s Tour de France victories, the two-time Olympic gold medallist Janja Garnbret, Laibach’s notoriety and Katarina Čas’s film roles are all framed as national opportunities.\n\nBut none of these Slovenian-born figures, however impressive, generate as much excitement as the former Melanija Knavs, now Melania Trump. When Donald Trump’s return to power made Melania the first lady again, the media response in Slovenia was predictable: state-run outlets largely downplayed the connection, but commercial media wasted no time promoting it as an opportunity.\n\nSlovenia’s largest commercial television network, Pop TV (nomen est omen), aired an interview with Ivo Boscarol, a wealthy Slovenian businessman who attended the inauguration celebrations in Washington. His argument? The Slovenian government had missed a golden opportunity to use Melania’s presence in the White House to improve its ties with the US.\n\nNow, as much as I enjoy cringing at Pop TV, I do take its influence seriously. It’s the most watched channel in Slovenia, meaning many Slovenians are likely absorbing and internalising this narrative. Some media commentators have even suggested that Melania might be a golden ticket in case “everything goes wrong”. I wonder if Trump’s rejection of the transatlantic alliance in favour of Vladimir Putin and his threat to launch a trade war on the EU mean that has already happened.\n\nThe problem with this thinking, however, is that it is not grounded in any reality. There is nothing whatsoever in Melania’s memoir to indicate that she has any interest in fostering a political or economic relationship between her adopted country and Slovenia. On the contrary, the few times she mentioned Slovenia during her first stint as Flotus, it was typically a reference to its “totalitarian past”, perhaps playing into the American fear and loathing of communism and socialism.\n\nMelania grew up in the small town of Sevnica and she left to pursue a modelling career before Slovenia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. She has typically kept quiet about her Slovenian heritage, even though much of her family still lives here, and she supposedly speaks Slovene with her son. In her speeches, she has consistently framed the US as the ideal, the place to be, while Slovenia is, well, a place to forget. Perhaps that’s why she has never seen fit to visit Slovenia during her tenure as first lady.\n\nBut let’s entertain the hypothetical for a moment. What if Melania’s position did present a unique opportunity for Slovenia? It’s hard to imagine, given that very little is known about her personal political views – except that she opposed her husband’s stance on abortion, a rare divergence. Still, her decision to marry a problematic public figure and then remain married to a leader displaying authoritarian tendencies speaks volumes. There is a certain complicity in that choice: a tacit approval of Trump’s idea that humiliating Volodymyr Zelenskyy or making Ukraine surrender to Russia’s demands is the basis for peace; of his renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America; of his plan to rebuild Gaza but perhaps not for Palestinians; a nod to his gender essentialism, demonisation of immigrants, climate denial; and even, ironically, abortion bans.\n\nSo Melania could become Slovenia’s best opportunity to obtain a special relationship with a fascist regime in the making. Is that the opportunity Slovenia wants? I’m not naive – rightwing ideologies have supporters in Slovenia, and they no doubt look up to Trump. But funnily enough, I am more afraid of the neoliberal politicians in power, and the business elites of our country who see any connection – no matter how toxic – as a potential win. I would really like to know whether we are in danger of relations between Slovenia and the US being – as our hopeful prime minister wished on X after Trump’s inauguration – “further strengthened”.\n\nFor now, Slovenia is fortunate that Melania has yet to show any real interest in using her position to strengthen ties with the country of her birth. There is no diplomatic gambit to be made, no grand strategic move to consider. Any celebration of Melania in the White House will pass, if it hasn’t already, and with it – luckily – Slovenia’s fleeting hope of leveraging her for political gain. Perhaps our next global celebrity will offer a more constructive opportunity. Until then, Slovenia may be better served by focusing on building relationships based on shared values and long-term interests – rather than relying on the whims of problematic individuals.",

        "content": "I saw the light at 22. Since my teens, I had been dyeing my naturally mousy hair very dark brown. Shades such as “mahogany” and “praline” were unforgiving against my pale skin, but that wasn’t important to me. As a teenager, I was desperate to be taken seriously and thought of as smart, maybe even intimidating. I wanted to be brunette to signal that I had chosen books over looks.\n\nThen, one day, shortly after I started my first job, it dawned on me: I didn’t have to do all that. It took two sessions with a professional to lighten my defiantly darkened hair, but I felt lighter at once. It was as if the bleach had seeped through to my brain, lifting not just my locks but my disposition.\n\nThe angst and earnestness of adolescence now seemed distant and hard to understand. Why had I ever felt like that, I wondered, smiling bemusedly, like Gwyneth Paltrow, when I could have been feeling like this. It is no coincidence that fairytales make so much of “flaxen hair”: I felt both charmed by the world and charming, as if I might coax songbirds to do my bidding.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘I wanted to signal I had chosen books over looks’ … Hunt on her 19th birthday. Photograph: Courtesy of Elle Hunt\n\nFor the first few weeks, out in public, I could feel people’s eyes on me, not because I was any more attractive – I didn’t kid myself – but because I felt more attractive and perhaps more visible. I moved confidently through the world, my honeyed head held high.\n\nThe so-called “halo effect” proved real, and aptly named. As a brunette, my most disagreeable traits – such as my tendency towards pedantry, debating and generally bringing down the vibe – had been obvious. Being blond softened those harsh edges, as though my every word and deed was implicitly tagged with lol – just kidding. It wasn’t just that I was having more fun. I was more fun, if not fun for the first time.\n\nThe difference was so marked, I could only assume that life got better the lighter your hair got. So, over the next decade, I dedicated time, money and effort into testing the hypothesis.\n\nIn the years since my scalp was first blessed with bleach, I’ve been in and out of salons, chasing my perfect shade: honey blond, sandy blond, dirty blond, golden blond, strawberry blond and very nearly platinum. Some looks did me no favours, evoking a scarecrow’s straw-like tresses. But despite ups and downs along the road, my holy grail was never in question: to be, if not the fairest of them all, indisputably fair – and make it seem effortless, even when it was anything but.\n\nIt was a small price to pay, or so I thought. As with every fairytale, there was a dark side. But it took years to wake up to it.\n\nView image in fullscreen Is being blond really a ‘cheat code to life’? Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian\n\nYou may be thinking (at least if you are a brunette) that I must be exaggerating – that there is no way that life as a blonde can be so different, so much better. But, as Joanna Pitman sets out in her eye-opening cultural history On Blondes, they have held our attention for centuries, for better and worse.\n\nOnly 2% of the adult population globally is said to be naturally fair. Yet blond (and white – the two terms aren’t interchangeable, though they are often used as such) women have been disproportionately the focus of mythology, culture and even politics. Likewise, blond is the most popular shade of dye.\n\nPitman tried it herself, bleaching her light brown hair – and, like me, instantly “felt younger and, strangely, more positive”. The effect was such that the associated upkeep started to seem not just worth it, but an investment. “After a while I wondered whether I could afford not to be blonde,” Pitman writes.\n\nThe benefits don’t seem to distinguish between bottle blondes and natural-born. Studies have shown that blond (and, again, white) women receive more male attention than brunettes.\n\nThat may not be your idea of fun – but blondes also have more funds. A 2008 study found blond female door-to-door fundraisers solicited more and larger contributions than their brunette counterparts. In an experiment reported on in 2012, waitresses wearing blond wigs received more and larger tips (though only from men). The so-called “blonde wage premium” has been shown to be equivalent to the return from an extra year of education. But a chunk of it, I would guess, goes back into the blond upkeep.\n\nView image in fullscreen Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. Photograph: Tim Rooke/Shutterstock\n\nFair hair doesn’t just look expensive. Regular salon visits are required to maintain the “natural” illusion and lightening is typically one of the most costly services on offer. (Diana, Princess of Wales, was reportedly spending £3,600 a year in the mid-90s – the equivalent of £7,200 a year or £600 a month today.) It is also time-intensive, taking as long as five hours in the chair every three months. Then there is the purple shampoo for banishing “brassy tones”, and the masks, moisturisers and treatments needed to protect against or alleviate the damage done by bleach.\n\nIf anything, the faff further demonstrates the blond advantage: you wouldn’t put yourself through it without a payoff. On TikTok it has been termed “blond privilege” as users compare how much better they are treated with lighter hair – like finding “a cheat code to life”, as one woman put it.\n\n“It is like a superpower,” rhapsodises my friend Ingrid. (That is not her name, but it might as well be: her long, light, creamy blonde hair once led her to be mistaken for a local at Oslo airport.)\n\nIngrid started dyeing her hair as a teenager. “My life changed in a dramatic way,” she says. “People looked at me differently. People were so nice to me, people fancied me.” She likens it to the positive reinforcement and approval that people report after weight loss.\n\nNow Ingrid is committed – to the quarterly dyes, the long stints in the chair, the Olaplex shampoo and other pricey products. After 15 years, she says, her artificial blond feels more than just natural: “It feels like me.” “Blonde” is, after all, a famously seductive identity – which is why we pursue it at great expense, against nature and sometimes even good sense.\n\nAs a stylist and image consultant, Francesca Cairns advises clients on shades (for clothing, makeup and hair) that best suit them. In most cases – Cairns estimates 70% – her recommendation is that they dye their hair darker.\n\nView image in fullscreen Francesca Cairns’s computer-generated image of Hunt’s ideal hair colour.\n\n“Sometimes I get comments like: do you not like people going blond? But some dye their hair blond simply because it is fashionable, without considering if it is actually going to suit their complexion or features,” Cairns says.\n\nHer recommendation for me, which she demonstrates with a digitally altered image, is a mid-auburn brown. I think I look both healthier and upsettingly ruddy, as if I’ve just returned from horse-riding.\n\nLightness isn’t the only concern in finding your optimum shade, says Cairns: tone (whether warm, cool or neutral) and overall harmony are also relevant, as well as practical concerns such as budget. But those can get pushed aside by the cultural tide shifting towards ever-fairer hair, Cairns says. “Even I did it when I was younger: I put a lot of blond highlights in my hair, and looked really washed out.”\n\nSometimes clients tell her that they are reluctant to go darker, “because their husband likes them blond”, Cairns says. “So it is a society thing, where you are maybe doing it for other people, so that they think you’re more fun or whatever, rather than for yourself.”\n\nCelebrities – who have stylists and colourists on speed dial, and are often wearing wigs – also give a false impression of what is possible, Cairns adds. “We all want to try it and experiment, but you find a lot of people do end up going back to a darker shade.” Cairns calls it “blond blindness” – where, by lightening already-bleached strands over time, you can find yourself blonder than you realise or want.\n\nThe day we speak, the Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown has just debuted a striking blond look at the Screen Actors Guild awards. Online, commentators speculate that Brown is renewing her bid to play Britney Spears in a biopic or seeking a more mature image, post-child stardom. The Daily Mail just says she looks old. (Brown later addressed the critical scrutiny of her appearance, calling it bullying.)\n\nView image in fullscreen New look … Millie Bobby Brown at the Screen Actors Guild awards in Los Angeles earlier this year. Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThat is the double-edged sword of blondness, as with many beauty standards: they are precisely calibrated, the rewards (such as they are) predicated on the “correct” performance. As per these unspoken rules, the “wrong” shade of blond – or inches of regrowth, or visible damage – risks drawing the wrong kind of attention, marking someone out as more “blond bombsite” than blond bombshell.\n\n“It is very much a class performance,” says Jennifer Berdahl, a sociology professor at the University of British Columbia who studies women and work. Her research suggests that even the purported advantages of being a blond woman – more money, attention, opportunities – are inextricable from the disadvantages. Though there is, of course, no truth to the airhead stereotype (a 2016 study confirmed blondes are no more likely to be unintelligent), Berdahl has found that they might enjoy more success because of the association with stupidity, not despite it.\n\nAs rare as it is, still, for women to hold top roles in business, academia and government, those who do are disproportionately likely to be blond. In her unpublished 2016 paper, Berdahl put it at 48% of female S&P 500 chief executives and 35% of female US senators. (Male leaders, however, were no more likely to be blond.) To Berdahl, the finding presented a paradox: why would having blond hair – associated with youth, innocence, even lack of intelligence – be advantageous for leadership? What she found was that a woman was seen as equally competent and independent, whether she had blond or brown hair – but, with lighter hair, she was perceived as significantly more attractive and warmer, and generally “more acceptable” as a leader.\n\nIt may go unacknowledged through discussion of celebrities’ bleach makeovers, best “lightening” products and how to achieve “the perfect blond” – but the preferential treatment of blondness is rooted in racial privilege. As Pitman writes, the centuries-long focus on blond is inextricable from its association with whiteness and racial purity, and “some of the most grotesque racially motivated barbarism ever perpetrated”. By bleaching their hair, “even white women can whiten themselves” and access the associated benefits, says Berdahl. She points to the prevalence of bright-yellow-blond women on Fox News and in Trump’s White House, signalling a “subtle, but very powerful, form of racial bias”.\n\nBut the cult of blond is so established – not to mention beloved – that many aren’t prepared to reckon with the fact of “blond privilege” beyond a jokey TikTok trend (or humblebrag). In 2023, the US academic Tressie McMillan Cottom, who is Black, was banned from the platform after her video positing “blond as a social status” provoked the criticism of other users. The outsized angry reaction, Cottom wrote in the New York Times, was proof of widespread reluctance to grapple with “the culture, economics and politics of blondness”, and its invisible work in securing, and protecting, power.\n\nIndeed, Berdahl’s findings on fair-haired chief executives were widely interpreted as “a prescription for how to get ahead, like: ‘I’m gonna go dye my hair blond!’” she says. “I would prefer to see people becoming aware of this bias, just like any other bias – and correcting for it.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Hunt with her new hair colour. Photograph: Courtesy of Ellle Hunt\n\nIn 2023, Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of Eat, Pray, Love, actually did correct for it – and in the most drastic way possible. Frustrated by her “fancy blond lady hair”, and the gendered expectation to maintain the look into her 50s and beyond, Gilbert let loose with the clippers and shaved her head.\n\nFor years she had fantasised about “not having to deal with hair any more”, Gilbert told Oldster magazine. What moved her to act was the realisation “that if I were a 54-year-old man, I would’ve buzzed my hair off years earlier, and my life would be simpler and less expensive”.\n\nReading about Gilbert’s experience clarified my own mounting ambivalence about being blond. Since 2019, when I left my job to go freelance, I had been extending the time between hair appointments and letting more of my natural ashy roots show, by dint of needing to economise and the post-pandemic effect of simply caring less. I had been asking my hairdresser, Katie, for the lowest-maintenance blond possible: we had even given up bleach. When only the lower third of my strands could be considered unequivocally blond, I wondered what I was hanging on to.\n\nYou might say the spell was broken.\n\nThe morning after the photo shoot for this article, I had a hair appointment. Instead of again requesting a “natural-looking” blond, I showed Katie the picture of Francesca Cairns’s suggested shade of brown.\n\nThe appointment was painless, and unbelievably quick. I didn’t quite recognise myself when I looked in the mirror – but I noticed my eyes first.\n\n“Look, I’m a brunette!” I declared to the first friend I saw.\n\nShe seemed confused. “I would have said you already were.”",

        "content": "Touring the Kennedy Center in Washington for the first time since his controversial takeover in February, Donald Trump criticized its buildings, mused about hosting its annual honors ceremony since he was “the king of ratings, whether we like it or not”, and took a shot at a hit musical that canceled its run in protest of his actions.\n\n“I never liked Hamilton very much,” the president said.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, the Hamilton producer Jeffrey Seller said the Broadway hit musical could not “in good conscience, participate and be a part of this new culture that is being imposed on the Kennedy Center”.\n\nThe Kennedy Center is a prestige cultural venue on the banks of the Potomac. Trump toured it on Monday with an entourage including Susie Wiles, his White House chief of staff; the country singer and Trump Bible salesman Lee Greenwood; and the Fox News hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Trump said: “We’re here to have our first board meeting.”\n\nThe New York Times obtained a recording of that meeting.\n\nAccording to the Times, the former NBC reality TV star proposed hosting the annual Kennedy Honors ceremony himself, because he was “the king of ratings, whether we like or not, the king of ratings”.\n\n“If you announced that, every network will start bidding on it, going crazy, for whatever reason, that’s the way it is,” Trump said.\n\nTrump reportedly mooted posthumous honors for two musical heroes, Elvis Presley and Luciano Pavarotti, and said: “We’re going to get some very good shows. I guess we have Les Mis coming.”\n\nLes Misérables will play the Kennedy in June and July, a booking made before Trump was elected last November.\n\nTrump also complained that it had not been possible to arrange a performance of “a little song” by Greenwood – possibly his hit, God Bless the USA – because “they wanted $30,000 to move a piano”.\n\nThe Kennedy Center opened in 1971, in memory of John F Kennedy, the 35th president, who was assassinated in 1963. On Monday, the Times said, Trump complained about the state of the buildings, criticizing recent renovations.\n\n“The Kennedy Center is in tremendous disrepair,” Trump said. The former New York real estate mogul also reportedly criticized exterior columns – “It’s supposed to be covered by something, whether it’s marble or whatever, granite” – and promised to “bring [the building] into more modern times”.\n\n“I thought it was very important to make this good,” Trump said. “It’s a very big part of the fabric of Washington DC.”\n\nDavid Rubenstein, the billionaire philanthropist, was the longtime chairperson of the Kennedy Center before being ousted amid Trump’s takeover.\n\nTrump said: “I know the person who was in charge of it and he’s a good man. I never realized this was in such bad shape.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Rubenstein did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for comment.\n\nThe Times reported that before the board meeting, Trump introduced a resolution giving him more oversight of the selection of art and artists. The paper quoted Trump as saying: “In the past … radical left lunatics … have been chosen. I didn’t like it.”\n\nNoting the recent appearance on Kennedy Center walls of portraits of Trump; his wife, Melania Trump; the vice-president, JD Vance; and his wife, Usha Vance, the Times noted that the Vances attended a classical music concert last weekend.\n\nAs the Guardian reported, the second couple were subjected to boos and jeers as they took their seats. Greeted by shouts of “You’ve ruined this place,” the vice-president responded with a wave.",

        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "A Brown University medical professor was deported to Lebanon over the weekend despite having a valid US work visa, defying a judge’s order blocking her immediate removal from the country.\n\nFederal prosecutors on Monday alleged that they deported 34-year-old Rasha Alawieh after discovering “sympathetic photos and videos” on her cellphone of prominent figures of Iran-backed Hezbollah. Alawieh told federal agents that she had recently attended the funeral of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, whom she supported from a “religious perspective”, according to Reuters.\n\nThe case centering on Alawieh comes as Donald Trump’s second presidential administration has been escalating its immigration policies and targeting universities.\n\nOn Sunday, the US deported more than 250 immigrants, allegedly members of a Venezuelan and Salvadorian gang, to El Salvador despite a judge’s order halting the flights.\n\nAlawieh was detained at Boston’s Logan international airport on Thursday after a trip to Lebanon to visit family. Her cousin, Yara Chehab, filed a lawsuit soon after in Massachusetts federal court on her behalf.\n\nOn Friday, US district court judge Leo Sorokin issued an order scheduling a hearing for Alawieh on Monday – and said that the federal government must give 48 hours’ notice to the court before her removal from the country. That hearing, however, was delayed at the request of an attorney for Chehab after other lawyers representing Chehab withdrew from the case, citing “further diligence”, as CNN reported. No other details were immediately available.\n\nNonetheless, in clear defiance of Sorokin’s order from Friday, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) put Alawieh on a flight to Paris that presumably was a layover back to Lebanon.\n\nOn Sunday, Sorokin said in court documents that CBP had received notice of the court order but “nonetheless thereafter willfully disobeyed the order by sending [Alawieh] out of the United States”. Sorokin ordered the government to respond to the “serious allegations with a legal and factual response” and a description of their version of events by Monday morning, ahead of a scheduled court hearing.\n\nCBP did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. In a comment to Reuters, a CBP spokesperson said that officers “adhere to strict protocols to identify and stop threats” and the burden is on people to establish admissibility into the US.\n\nIn a statement obtained by Reuters, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, called the deportation “commonsense security”.\n\n“A visa is a privilege, not a right – glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied,” she said.\n\nIn a statement, a Brown spokesperson said that the university was “seeking to learn more about what has happened, but we need to be careful about sharing information publicly about any individual’s personal circumstances”.\n\nBrown noted that Alawieh had a clinical appointment with the university but was an employee of Brown Medicine, a non-profit that is affiliated with the medical school but is not operated by the university.\n\nOn Sunday, after Alawieh’s deportation, Brown sent an email advising international students and faculty members to avoid international travel due to “potential changes in travel restrictions and travel bans”.\n\nDr George Bayliss, a Brown medical professor who works with Alawieh at the university’s division of kidney disease and hypertension, told the New York Times that the staff “are all outraged”.\n\n“None of us know why this happened,” he said.\n\nBefore Sunday’s mass deportation to El Salvador, the US district court judge James Boasberg said that the Trump White House could not accelerate the deportations out by invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a centuries-old wartime law giving the president that ability. Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to explain whether it had violated the judge’s order with its mass deportation at a hearing scheduled for late Monday afternoon.\n\nOn Sunday, the White House released a statement upbraiding Boasberg, an extraordinary display of defiance against the judiciary, which has served as a check on presidential power throughout the history of the US.\n\n“A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movement of an aircraft … full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from US soil,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement.\n\nAlawieh’s removal also comes at a time when the Trump administration has targeted universities, particularly Columbia University, after the series of pro-Palestinian protests it saw in 2024.\n\nRecently, federal law enforcement with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia graduate student with a green card who was a leader of the protests, for deportation.\n\nRanjani Srinivasan, a graduate student at Columbia from India, was also targeted by immigration authorities at the beginning of March despite having no ties to the protests. Srinivasan fled to Canada, which US officials have described as a “self-deportation”, according to the New York Times.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is also considering new travel restrictions for citizens of dozens of countries. A draft list of countries showed three separate groups that would undergo either full or partial visa suspensions.",

Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu are close allies, with the US being the biggest military supplier to Israel by far, delivering huge amounts of bombs and missiles being used to kill Palestinians across Gaza. US national security council spokesperson Brian Hughes said earlier today that “Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war”. In a Fox News interview, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Israel had notified the US about the attacks before they were launched. “As President Trump has made it clear - Hamas, the Houthis, Iran and all those who seek to terrorise not just Israel, but also the United States of America, will see a price to pay. All hell will break loose,” she said. Earlier this month, Trump repeated a threat to destroy Hamas in a “last warning” to release the hostages.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that he ordered the airstrikes because of a lack of progress in talks to extend the ceasefire. Officials said the attacks were open-ended and are expected to expand. The Guardian’s international security correspondent, Jason Burke, has written up a useful explainer about other reasons why the airstrikes were launched, with Netanyahu, still facing huge opposition from much of the Israeli public, emboldened by the Trump administration. Here is an extract from his story: Israeli officials say targeting the Hamas leadership, which has re-emerged in recent weeks to again take control of Gaza, will bring about the release of more hostages. Many hostage families in Israel dispute this. More practically, Israel now has capabilities it lacked six weeks ago. Ammunition stocks have been replenished – partly due to US deliveries – and new potential targets among Hamas’ leaders identified. Planes and other equipment have been repaired. Troops have been rested… Netanyahu needs support from rightwing allies to win crucial votes in Israel’s parliament in coming days and weeks, and to maintain his grip on power. These allies have fiercely opposed a permanent end to hostilities in Gaza, with one resigning from his ministerial post in protest at the January ceasefire. This vital support is now assured – at least in the short term. Netanyahu is also on trial for corruption. If found guilty, he could face prison. On Tuesday, a court approved Netanyahu’s request not to appear at a hearing on Tuesday “due to the renewal of the war”, Israeli media reported. On Sunday, Netanyahu announced he would seek to dismiss the head of the Israeli’s internal security service. This has been seen as a further attempt to override democratic checks in Israel and big protests are expected later this week. These can now be portrayed as unpatriotic by Netanyahu’s supporters.

        "content": "The Trump administration fired most of the board of the US Institute of Peace (USIP) and installed its new leader in the Washington DC headquarters of the independent organization on Monday, despite protests that the agency is not even part of the executive branch.\n\nIn the administration’s latest effort targeting agencies tied to foreign assistance work, the remaining three members of the USIP board – the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and the president of the National Defense University, Peter Garvin – fired the president and CEO, George Moose, on Friday, according to a document obtained by the Associated Press.\n\nAn executive order that Donald Trump signed last month targeted the organization, which was created by Congress more than 40 years ago, and others for reductions.\n\nCurrent USIP employees said staffers from Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” entered the building despite protests that the institute is not part of the executive branch and is therefore not under the jurisdiction of the White House.\n\nThe USIP called the police, whose vehicles were outside the building on Monday evening.\n\nThe USIP is a congressionally funded independent non-profit that works to advance US values in conflict resolution, ending wars and promoting good governance.\n\nMoose said: “Doge has broken into our building.” The CEO vowed legal action, saying: “What has happened here today is an illegal takeover by elements of the executive branch of a private non-profit.”\n\nHe said the institute’s headquarters, located across the street from the state department, is not a federal building. Speaking to reporters after leaving the building, Moose noted: “It was very clear that there was a desire on the part of the administration to dismantle a lot of what we call foreign assistance, and we are part of that family.”\n\nThe Doge workers gained access to the building after several unsuccessful attempts on Monday and after having been turned away on Friday, a senior USIP official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what the Doge staffers were doing or looking for in the non-profit’s building, which is across the street from the state department in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.\n\nA White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, pointed to the USIP’s “non-compliance” with Trump’s order.\n\nAfter that, “11 board members were lawfully removed, and remaining board members appointed Kenneth Jackson acting president”, she said. “Rogue bureaucrats will not be allowed to hold agencies hostage. The Trump administration will enforce the president’s executive authority and ensure his agencies remain accountable to the American people.”\n\nJackson had been seen earlier on Monday trying to enter the non-profit’s building.\n\nMoose said the organization had been speaking with Doge since last month, trying to explain its independent status. Speaking of Trump, he said: “I can’t imagine how our work could align more perfectly with the goals that he has outlined: keeping us out of foreign wars, resolving conflicts before they drag us into those kinds of conflicts.”\n\nDoge has expressed interest in the USIP for weeks but has been rebuffed by lawyers who argued that the institute’s status protected it from the kind of reorganization that is occurring in other federal agencies.\n\nOn Friday, Doge members arrived with two FBI agents, who left after the institute’s lawyer told them of the USIP’s “private and independent status”, the organization said in a statement.\n\nThe chief of security, Colin O’Brien, said police on Monday helped Doge members enter the building and that the private security team for the organization had its contract canceled.\n\nThe USIP says on its website that it is a non-partisan, independent organization “dedicated to protecting US interests by helping to prevent violent conflicts and broker peace deals abroad”.\n\nThe non-profit says it was created by Congress in 1984 as an “independent non-profit corporation”, and it does not meet US code definitions of “government corporation”, “government-controlled corporation” or “independent establishment”.\n\nAlso named in the president’s executive order were the US African Development Foundation, a federal agency that invests in African small businesses; the Inter-American Foundation, a federal agency that invests in Latin America and the Caribbean; and the Presidio Trust, which oversees a national park site next to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.\n\nThe African Development Foundation, which also unsuccessfully tried to keep Doge staff from entering its offices in Washington, went to court, but a federal judge ruled last week that removing most grants and most staff would be legal. The president of the Inter-American Foundation sued on Monday to block her firing in February by the Trump administration.",

        "title": "A new Manchester United stadium isn’t about regeneration and never will be",
        "source": "https://www.theguardian.com/",
        "content": "The roof of the proposed new Manchester United stadium has three points, which is more than can often be said for the team who will play underneath it. According to Nigel Dancey of the architectural firm Foster + Partners, the three giant masts will “create a distinctive presence on the skyline”, presumably in the same way that Roy Keane created a distinctive presence on Alf‑Inge Haaland’s knee.\n\nBut of course aesthetic quibbles are the least of our concerns here. If Manchester United want to erect a giant plastic canopy over their new 100,000-seat stadium in a way that evokes a chicken being wrapped before roasting, then frankly who are we to demur? Beauty is in the eye of the freeholder, and all that. The more pressing question – as someone who, unlike part-owner Jim Ratcliffe, still pays income tax in this country – is what exactly the rest of us are getting out of this.\n\nWhy knock down the biggest club stadium in the UK, the fifth biggest in Europe? Why not simply refurbish a venue that already generates plenty of revenue? Indeed, why even unveil this project now, before a single penny of funding for this £2bn project has been secured?\n\nOn the last of these at least, United’s chief operating officer, Collette Roche, had this to say. “Until you actually articulate the mission and show the art of the possible, nobody takes you seriously,” she said at the MIPIM property trade show in Cannes, where United were pitching for external investment. And of course for a club drowning in debt, laying off staff, projecting the redevelopment as a grand shiny infrastructure project is the only feasible way of unlocking the public money that will turn New Trafford into an effortless cash machine.\n\nIn one sense, this is a fait accompli. The government has given its backing, and Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, sounds supremely confident about securing the £200m‑£300m of government investment that would be required for related infrastructure. Already fantastical figures are wafting through the media ecosystem with a bare minimum of scrutiny: 17,000 new homes, 92,000 new jobs, an extra £7.3bn a year to the UK economy.\n\nAnd it is at this point that we meet our first knot of resistance. The academic literature is pretty unequivocal on this point: economists have consistently found virtually no evidence to suggest that new stadiums provide any net benefit to a city in terms of wages, tax receipts or jobs. As the late economist Allen Sanderson put it: “If you want to inject money into the local economy, it would be better to drop it from a helicopter than invest it in a new ballpark.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Jim Ratcliffe and his management team have suggested that their new stadium would be worth an extra £7.3bn a year to the UK economy. Photograph: Lucy North/PA\n\nSo where do these numbers come from? Mostly from somewhere else. Any uplift to local property prices comes at a cost to other areas of the city. Any new housing will almost certainly be hoovered up by buy-to-let investors. Meanwhile, increased leisure spending at New Trafford is, to a large extent, simply going to relocate leisure spending from elsewhere in Manchester. Put it like this: if someone builds a new restaurant near your favourite restaurant, you’re not suddenly going to start eating two dinners.\n\nAs for jobs, most of the extra work will be seasonal, part-time security and catering employment: the foundation stones of the exploitation economy. The plan to prefabricate the new stadium and move it up the Manchester ship canal will put a firm ceiling on the amount of construction labour required. Indeed, one of the centrepieces of the new development involves relocating the Trafford Park rail freight terminal beside the stadium, which will probably be moved at great expense to Parkside East in St Helens. So, actually … moving jobs out of Manchester to Merseyside. How does that tend to go down?\n\nBut of course none of this is really the point. To investors and powerbrokers the great appeal of stadium economics is that it so rarely functions like economics at all. Football fans do not behave like rational customers. Millions of people pay a significant portion of their increasingly stretched incomes to watch a football team mostly not win, for ever.\n\nThis blind loyalty, this guaranteed bottom line, is what makes football such an irresistible investment vehicle. But it also means the only way to secure the kind of exponential growth the modern investor demands is essentially to move these fans out, upgrade them, replace them with richer, less discerning consumers.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Traditionally the football stadium served as a kind of nucleus to its local community: generating concentric waves of buzz and footfall and revenue that would emanate out to the streets and cafes and pubs that surrounded it. The stadium makes money. The chip shop next to the stadium makes money. The pub behind the chip shop makes money. The community centre behind the pub charges £10 for parking.\n\nThe modern stadium-campus, by contrast, takes a more proprietary view of its role in the built environment: not simply the beating heart but the entire body. Everything from the chips to the pints to the parking is taken in-house. You work for us. Everything here is the property of Manchester United plc, exists entirely on our sufferance, and we built this roof to be sure.\n\nAnd at the root of all this lies a pointed question. If all this development is such a nailed-on wealth generator, why are the Glazers not funding it themselves? Why are investment funds not clambering over each other to get involved in the Trafford Park rail freight relocation project? Why is Ratcliffe, a man who moved to Monaco in order to avoid paying the British exchequer an estimated £4bn in taxes, not putting his outrageous fortune where his muttering mouth is?\n\nBecause, of course, this was never about regeneration, and never will be. This is simply neoliberalism at play, carving up our cities for their benefit and expecting us to be grateful for footing the bill. Cut some jobs. Abolish ticket concessions. Raise season-ticket prices. Make a sad face while you’re doing it. Meanwhile, allow us to show you this irresistible investment opportunity. It’s a win-win. It’s easy money. You might even call it a distinctive presence on your local economy.",

        "content": "Israel’s military has ordered an evacuation of parts of eastern Gaza, hours after launching a wave of airstrikes that killed more than 400 people, shattering the pause in hostilities since mid-January in the devastated Palestinian territory.\n\nThe evacuation orders, which cover the northern town of Beit Hanoun and other communities further south, suggest that Israeli troops may launch renewed ground operations within hours.\n\nView image in fullscreen A woman mourns next to the body of a person who was killed in Israeli airstrikes, at Al-Maadani hospital in Gaza City. Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPA\n\nPalestinian health authorities reported a total of 404 deaths in the strikes, which Israeli military officials said targeted Hamas military commanders and political officials. More than 600 were reported injured. Both air attacks and artillery fire was reported to be continuing across much of Gaza at noon local time.\n\nAid officials in Gaza described “a very bad night” and said that hundreds, possibly thousands, were already on the move to comply with the Israeli evacuation orders. “There is no resilience. People have hardly recovered from so much violence. They are in a very weak state, physically and psychologically,” one aid official in Gaza told the Guardian.\n\nView image in fullscreen Grieving relatives mourn Palestinians who lost their lives in an Israeli strike in central Gaza. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nIn Washington, a White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted the US administration before it carried out the strikes.\n\nAttacks were reported in northern Gaza and in the central cities of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. One strike was reported to have killed 17 members of a family in Rafah. The dead included five children, their parents, and a man and his three children, medics at the hospital that received the bodies said.\n\nAnother, in Abasan al-Kabira, east of Khan Younis, resulted in the deaths of 13 people.\n\nThere were also reports of other strikes on schools used as shelters for the displaced, individual apartments in tower blocks in Gaza City, and in tented encampments in the coastal zone of al-Mawasi.\n\nCasualties included senior Hamas officials, including the most senior political leader in Gaza and ministers, as well as many women and children, Palestinian officials said.\n\nCivil defence teams in Gaza said they were overwhelmed. The Palestinian Red Crescent said its teams dealt with 86 people killed and 134 wounded.\n\nOfficials from Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza and al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, which have all been extensively damaged in the war, said that altogether they had received about 85 dead.\n\nWitnesses said patients lay on the floor at the hospital, some screaming, and a young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged.\n\nIsraeli and US officials blame Hamas for the renewed violence, saying the Islamist militant organisation has refused to release more of the 59 hostages it holds in Gaza, thus breaking the ceasefire agreement that came into effect in January. Hamas said hostage releases were due only during a scheduled second phase that Israel agreed in January but has since refused to discuss or implement.\n\nIn a statement issued shortly after strikes began, Israel Katz, Israel’s defence minister, said “the gates of hell will open in Gaza” and that Hamas would be hit with a force it has “never seen before” if it did not release all remaining hostages.\n\n“We will not stop fighting until all of the hostages return home and all the war’s aims are achieved,” Katz said.\n\nThe office of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accused Hamas of “repeated refusal” to release hostages and of rejecting proposals from Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for an extension of the pause in hostilities. “Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe first phase of the ceasefire agreed in January involved 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight dead Israelis returned by militant groups in Gaza in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.\n\nUnder the scheduled second phase of the ceasefire, there would have been a total Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the release of all hostages and a definitive end to hostilities. With the backing of the US, Israel has been pushing instead been for the return of all remaining hostages in exchange for further prisoner releases and a 30- to 60-day truce, in line with Witkoff’s proposal.\n\nEarlier this month, Israel blocked deliveries of aid from entering Gaza and cut off remaining electricity supplies in a bid to pressure Hamas.\n\nThe US national security council spokesperson, Brian Hughes, said Hamas “could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war”.\n\nTaher al-Nunu, a Hamas official, said the international community faced “a moral test”.\n\n“Either it allows the return of the crimes committed by the occupation army or it enforces a commitment to ending the aggression and war against innocent people in Gaza,” al-Nunu said.\n\nThe strikes come at a tense moment in Israel domestic politics. Netanyahu said on Sunday he would fire Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security service, a controversial move that immediately prompted accusations of authoritarianism and plans for major protests on Wednesday.\n\nIn his statement about the latest strikes, Netanyahu said he had approved the attacks “over the weekend”, suggesting the decision preceded the announcement of his intention to fire Bar.\n\nView image in fullscreen Palestinians gather possessions after an airstrike that hit a home in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nCritics accuse Netanyahu of using war to maintain his own grip on power.\n\n“It is all connected … The hostages have been sacrificed for political reasons,” said Ora Peled Nakash, a former senior officer in Israel’s navy and protest organiser. Recent polls show widespread support in Israel for a deal to end the war.\n\nMuch of Gaza lies in ruins after 15 months of fighting, which erupted on 7 October 2023 when thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251 hostages.\n\nThe Israeli campaign in response has killed more than 48,000 people and reduced much of the territory to ruins. Ninety per cent of houses are damaged or destroyed, and much of the population is displaced. Roads, hospitals, schools, sanitation systems and much else has been reduced to rubble.\n\nReuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Before he was abruptly fired last month, Derek Copeland worked as a trainer at the US Department of Agriculture’s National Dog Detection Training Center, preparing beagles and Labrador retrievers to sniff out plants and animals that are invasive or vectors for zoonotic diseases, like swine fever. Copeland estimates the NDDTC lost about a fifth of its trainers and a number of other support staff when 6,000 employees were let go at the USDA in February as part of a government-wide purge orchestrated by the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nBefore he received his termination notice, he says, Copeland had just spent several months training the only dog stationed in Florida capable of detecting the Giant African land snail, an invasive mollusk that poses a significant threat to Florida agriculture. “We have dogs for spotted and lantern flies, Asian longhorn beetles,” he says, referring to two other non-native species. “I don’t think the American people realize how much crap that people bring into the United States.”\n\nDog trainers are just one example of the kind of highly specialized USDA staff that have been removed from their stations in recent weeks. Teams devoted to inspecting plant and food imports have been hit especially hard by the recent cuts, including the Plant Protection and Quarantine program, which has lost hundreds of staffers alone.\n\n“It’s causing problems left and right,” says one current USDA worker, who like other federal employees in this story asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “It’s basically a skeleton crew working now,” says another current USDA staffer, who noted that both they and most of their colleagues held advanced degrees and had many years of training to protect US food and agriculture supply chains from invasive pests. “It’s not something that is easily replaced by artificial intelligence.”\n\n“These aren’t your average people,” says Mike Lahar, the regulatory affairs manager at US customs broker behemoth Deringer. “These were highly trained individuals—inspectors, entomologists, taxonomists.”\n\nLahar and other supply chain experts warn that the losses could cause food to go rotten while waiting in ports and could lead to even higher grocery prices, in addition to increasing the chances of potentially devastating invasive species getting into the country. These dangers are especially acute at a moment when US grocery supply chains are already reeling from other business disruptions such as bird flu and President Trump’s new tariffs.\n\n“If we're inspecting less food, the first basic thing that happens is some amount of that food we don't inspect is likely to go bad. We're going to end up losing resources,” says supply chain industry veteran and software CEO Joe Hudicka.\n\nGot a Tip?

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Kateknibbs.09.\n\nThe USDA cuts are being felt especially in coastal states home to major shipping ports. USDA sources who spoke to WIRED estimate that the Port of Los Angeles, one of the busiest in the US, lost around 35 percent of its total Plant Protection and Quarantine staff and 60 percent of its “smuggling and interdiction” employees, who are tasked with stopping illegal pests and goods from entering the country. The Port of Miami, which handles high volumes of US plant imports, lost about 35 percent of its plant inspectors.",

        "content": "It happens to the best of us: You wake up in the middle of the night, clammy and swimming in sweat. If you’re a hot sleeper, a cooling mattress may be for you. Waking up sweaty and hot can be caused by several factors, like sleeping conditions, stress, excessive blankets, the wrong pajamas, and even eating spicy foods before bed. Hot nights can also equate to sleepless nights. According to a study from the Journal of Physiological Anthropology, heat exposure increases wakefulness and decreases time spent in deep sleep and REM sleep.\n\nNo matter the cause, a cooling mattress is a great first step in combating a sweaty sleep. A cooling mattress is built specifically to help regulate your body temperature by being made of materials that optimize airflow and draw heat away from your body as you sleep. A cooling mattress can really make all the difference in avoiding overheating and getting a restful night’s sleep.\n\nI usually run hotter than most—for better or worse, I'm not one of those waifish people who are perpetually cold. I (and some of my sweatiest colleagues) tested a myriad of cooling mattresses for at least a week each in our homes—to determine which works as advertised to beat the heat. These are the best cooling mattresses I've tested. All prices listed are for queen size.\n\nBe sure to read our other sleep guides, including the Best Mattresses, Best Mattresses for Side Sleepers, Best Organic Mattresses, Best Bed Sheets, Best Bed Frames, and Best Sleep Trackers.\n\nUpdated March 2024: We've added the Bedgear H Performance, Wolf, and Awara Premier Luxury Hybrid mattresses, and moved the Wayfair 10.5-Inch Plush Cooling Gel Mattress and Wayfair Sleep 8-Inch Medium Cooling Gel Memory Foam to honorable mentions. We've updated prices throughout.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just $2.50 $1 per month for 1 year.

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "I often like new-fangled things that look or act like old-fangled things. An infrared heater that looks like an old box amp of unknown origin? Silly retro-tech? Count me in.\n\nBut the new MoonKettle from Japanese brand Balmuda is something else altogether. The stainless steel MoonKettle is an elegant intersection of extremes: a hair-precise and quite modern digital electric kettle whose moony, loop-handled form looks nonetheless decidedly ancient.\n\nIts makers have alternately said they were inspired by Yaoguan kettles forged among the five famous kilns of China, by old Japanese teacraft, or perhaps by the spirit of reverence itself. The MoonKettle is a little bit 19th-century cast iron, a little bit Yixing brass—and maybe a little bit third-wave coffee geek. The kettle offers surprisingly robust temperature control for a device that goes to such lengths to look archaic.\n\nPhotograph: Balmuda\n\nThe kettle, released March 6, comes in two colors, black and white. This almost tricks you into wanting both, a hot-water yang and yin. But doing so would be an extravagance. As with many of Balmuda's exquisitely design-forward devices, the $260 MoonKettle costs a bit more than you expect.\n\nBut unlike Balmuda's previous gooseneck, which privileged its lovely art deco style over added functionality, the MoonKettle has a genuine place on the counter for the modern tea or coffee nerd.\n\nPlay Me a Little Tune\n\nBut first, a little song and dance.\n\nBalmuda is a 22-year-old Japanese brand made famous in the United States by a pretty little steam-assisted toaster oven that makes implausibly good toast. The device went viral on TikTok a couple years ago, as it was always destined to do. (WIRED liked it first, 8/10, WIRED Recommends, before it even was even technically sold here, mannnnnnnnnn.)\n\nBalmuda makes precious few and quite disparate items: a toaster oven, a coffee brewer, a lantern, a speaker. Each tends to be a small miracle of lovable design, with odd little touches meant to make you fall in love with your appliance. Each is also often quirky, for better and for worse. FWIW, we still have that toaster oven among our favorites.",

        "title": "Meet the Game Developer Turning Fanfic Into Deadpool DLC",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Before she started writing video games, Emma Kidwell loved Twilight fanfiction. Her “bad, self-insert” stories found a home on DeviantArt, an online community where people posted fan art, original work, and so much more. “The low barrier of entry made it very accessible,” Kidwell says.\n\nHer writing turned into role-playing in forums, and Twilight fandom gave way to a love of video games like Mass Effect. Today, Kidwell is a writer for Firaxis Games and a rising star in the world of game narrative. Her work includes Hindsight, Borderlands 4, Life Is Strange 2, and Sid Meier’s Civilization VII; she’s been featured in Forbes 30 Under 30 and The Game Awards’ Future Class of 2023.\n\nThis week, she’s hosting the annual Independent Games Festival (IGF) awards during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. All of that is happening alongside her talk about how writing in fandoms as a kid helped her write DLC for Marvel's Midnight Suns.\n\nWriting fanfiction, it turns out, isn’t so different from writing licensed characters. “I’m role-playing when I'm writing Marvel IP for Firaxis,” Kidwell says. “Fanfiction gave me that foundation to build off of.”\n\nFanfiction has often been considered a lower form of writing, as either self indulgent or outrageously erotic, the sort of work one does in secret. In the internet culture pantheon, few fanfic writers have ever achieved fame, and those that have sometimes do so for the salacious nature of their work. “My Immortal,” an infamous Harry Potter fanfic, is still referenced in interviews even today. Writers such as E.L. James, who created the Fifty Shades series (originally a Twilight fanfic), however, have begun to turn their work into something profitable.\n\nOthers, like Kidwell, have turned it into a runway for their careers. “I think because of fanfiction’s relationship to marginalized communities, it wasn't initially seen as being a valid form of writing,” Kidwell says. Clearly, that’s wrong. The gaming and fanfic communities make for a harmonious marriage. The story-driven nature of most games means plenty of fodder for fans craving new narratives, but writers on well-known sites like Archive of Our Own can—and will turn—anything into an original story. Even Tetris.\n\n“Fanfiction is your sandbox,” Kidwell says. “You get to play. There are no rules. You get comfortable playing around with characters that aren't yours and doing whatever the hell you want with them.”\n\nFor Midnight Suns, Kidwell was given four characters to choose from, including Deadpool and Storm. Whatever she wrote would be based on the comic versions of the characters, not their cinematic counterparts. While researching both characters, she had a revelation: “This is really similar to what I would think about when creating an original character in a role-playing setting. How would this character fit in with other established characters?”\n\nWriters in Kidwell’s position still have to stick to the rules of the franchise, including its story canon. That hasn’t kept Kidwell from being able to tell the stories she wants. “I think a big, common misconception with IP writing is that it's super restrictive,” Kidwell says. “But I think there's a lot of creative freedom within certain boundaries because you get to inject a little piece of yourself into these characters. It's just kind of like a puzzle: figure out how you can do it authentically and how you can do it in a way that makes sense for the game.”\n\nKidwell still role-plays in her spare time. Right now, she’s deep into the Dragon Age community. “I see IP writing as kind of the in-between,” she says of fanfiction and fiction. It’s a natural next step in role-playing: “I'm just doing it in a professional setting now.”",

        "content": "It's not rocket science. A huge part of the reason why Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers are the best face computer is because a lot of people already do want to wear Ray-Ban Wayfarers. It’s a lot easier to persuade people to wear a smart accessory when that accessory looks sharp as hell. Meta has committed to the bit with its latest launch, the Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni collaboration, which just debuted at Paris Fashion Week, no less.\n\nPhotograph: Ray-Ban; Meta\n\nCoperni is a French fashion brand that’s known for semi-techy stunts like spraying a dress onto model Bella Hadid, so collaborating with Meta isn’t totally off-brand. The Coperni glasses are limited-edition (naturally). In addition to all the usual Ray-Ban Meta features—live video recording, AI capabilities, pretty great sound quality—the Coperni glasses have limited edition numbering, a Coperni charging case, and gray mirror lenses. Important to remember, though: Buying a $549 pair of fashion AI glasses will not make you look like a modern-day oligarch.

That’s quite the pedigree.\n\nThe two EVs are the Speedster (above), with no roof or windscreen, which will be followed by a fixed-roof, two-seat coupe called the Roadster. The rear-wheel drive Speedster will be limited to 150 cars, and weigh in at just 895 kg, giving it a 275-mile range, a claimed 0-62 mph time of 3.5 seconds, and $92,600 price tag. The Roadster will be cheaper at $70,850, but 100 kg heavier, yet still good for 0-62 mph in 3.6 seconds, and 280 miles.\n\nLongbow claims it will have a prototype by summer, and final cars to those brave enough to pre-order as early as next year. And in case you were wondering if it’s just coincidence one of the EVs is called “Roadster,” it isn’t. Co-founder Daniel Davy, who worked at Tesla during the development of its original Roadster, told Top Gear that the moniker was a jibe at the continually delayed Tesla Roadster MkII.\n\n“A lot of customers have put deposits down for a Roadster that they can’t get,” Davy told Top Gear. “If people want to get back their $250,000 deposit for a 2020 car and put it into a better car they’re going to get sooner, they’re welcome to do it. Our Roadster’s going to be on the ground first.” —Jeremy White\n\nGet a Handle on JBL's Pimped Most Popular Speakers\n\nPhotography: JBL\n\nJBL dropped two new speakers in time for the warm weather ahead. This week, the company debuted rejigged versions of the JBL Flip 7 and the JBL Charge 6—two of its most popular models. Both have enhanced sound (\"bigger and bolder,\" according to JBL), its Sound Boost tech that analyzes music in real-time and optimizes the driver accordingly, as well as high-res lossless audio via USB-C. You can also pair it with other Auracast-enabled JBL speakers (although it won't work with older models that use PartyBoost).",

        "title": "OPM Watchdog Says Review of DOGE Work Is Underway",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The Office of Personnel Management’s acting inspector general has confirmed that the independent office is investigating whether any “emerging threats” to sensitive information have arisen as a result of Elon Musk’s DOGE operatives introducing rapid changes to protected government networks.\n\n“The OPM OIG [office of the inspector general] is committed to providing independent and objective oversight of OPM’s programs and operations,” writes the acting inspector general, Norbert Vint, in a letter dated March 7 to Democratic lawmakers, adding that his office is not only legally required to scrutinize OPM’s security protocols, but routinely does so based on “developing risks.” The letter stated that the office would fold specific requests issued by Democratic lawmakers last month into its “existing work,” while also initiating a “new engagement” over potential risks at the agency associated with computer systems that have been accessed or modified by the United States DOGE Service.\n\nVint, whose predecessor was fired by Trump in January, is one of a half dozen deputy inspectors general urged by Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last month to investigate reports from WIRED and other outlets about DOGE’s efforts to gain access to a wide range of record systems that host some of the government’s most sensitive data, including personnel files on millions of government employees and their families.\n\n“We are deeply concerned that unauthorized system access could be occurring across the federal government and could pose a major threat to the personal privacy of all Americans and to the national security of our nation,” Gerald Connolly, the oversight committee’s ranking Democrat, wrote in a letter on February 6.\n\nIn addition to OPM, Democrats have pressed for similar security assessments at five other agencies, including at the Treasury Department, the General Services Administration, the Small Business Administration, the US Agency for International Development, and the Department of Education. However, Vint is the only watchdog at any of the named agencies to have responded so far, a committee spokesperson tells WIRED.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at dell.3030.\n\nWhile in the minority in the House and Senate, Democrats have little power to conduct effective oversight outside of formal hearings, which must be convened by Republicans. During his first term, Trump’s Justice Department issued guidance notifying executive agencies that they had zero obligation to respond to questions from Democrats.\n\nCongressional Republicans have committed to little, if any, formal oversight of DOGE’s work, opting instead to back-channel with the billionaire over the impacts of his anti-personnel crusade.\n\nThe executive order establishing DOGE, signed by the president on his first day in office, instructed federal agencies to provide Musk’s operatives with “full and prompt access” to all unclassified records systems in order to effectuate a government-wide purge of “fraud, waste, and abuse.” It quickly became clear, however, that DOGE’s staff, many of them young engineers with direct ties to Musk’s own businesses, were paying little attention to key privacy safeguards; eschewing, for instance, mandatory assessments of new technologies installed on protected government networks.\n\n“Several of the concerns you expressed in your letter touch on issues that the OPM OIG evaluates as part of our annual reviews of OPM’s IT and financial systems, and we plan to incorporate those concerns into these existing projects,” writes Vint in the March 7 letter. “We have also just begun an engagement to assess risks associated with new and modified information systems at OPM. We believe that, ultimately, our new engagement will broadly address many of your questions related to the integrity of OPM systems.”",

        "content": "I know this is unconventional, but I’m going to start by telling you the ending. Or at least, the ending as it stands today. Most of the people involved in this story wind up either dead, maimed, spending months in a mental hospital, languishing in jail, or gone underground. It's a tragedy from almost any angle, especially because, at the outset, most of these people were idealists committed to doing as much good as possible in a world they saw as beset by existential threats. In spite of those aims, or perhaps in pursuit of them, over the course of this story their lives will devolve into senseless violence. And by the time we reach the present, six people will be killed, two others presumed dead by suicide, and at least two in hiding. Countless friends and family members will find themselves bereft. I feel it's only fair to warn you that, in this story, justice and redemption have so far proven hard to come by.\n\nHow did so much go so wrong? When did it begin to fall apart? Trying to answer these questions—as I’ve done for the past two years—is not unlike querying a chatbot powered by a large language model. The responses you receive depend on the prompts you compose. Ask the question one way, and you might elicit a set of facts adhering to one reality: The emergence of the world’s first AI-inflected death cult, whose obsessions over the prospect of a machine superintelligence eventually sent them spiraling into destruction. Tweak the prompt, and you may produce an entirely different story: of a charismatic, deranged leader spreading a carefully engineered mania to followers seeking purpose in life. Try again, and you could get the tale of a vulnerable minority, driven to act at the extremes of their convictions by a society that rejects them.\n\nBut just like the outputs produced by our current AI oracles, some of these narratives turn out to be rife with hallucinations: plausible-sounding visions of reality, but fabricated to fill the need for a greater meaning. The trouble, as I went along, was separating the truth from the delirium. I wasn't always sure that I could. To be honest, I'm still not. But here we are, and a story has to start somewhere.\n\nI.\n\nLet’s begin on an afternoon in mid-November 2019, under the redwood canopy in Northern California, along a road called Bohemian Highway. It was a Friday, and Sergeant Brian Parks of the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office was on patrol along the Russian River near the town of Guerneville when a call came over his radio. Someone had dialed 911 from Westminster Woods, a wilderness camp and retreat center about 8 miles away. The caller reported that a group of several people had driven up and blocked the camp's entrance and exit with their vehicles. They'd gotten out and begun some kind of demonstration, clad in black robes and masks.\n\nSonoma sheriffs occasionally encounter protesters at Bohemian Grove, a secretive men’s club for powerful elites that also meets in the redwoods near Guerneville, but the county was typically “not a hotbed” for that sort of thing, Parks says. So he thought to himself, “You know what, I'm just going to roll that way,” and steered his car toward Westminster Woods.\n\nThe camp was hosting two groups of visitors that day. One was an alumni gathering for a nonprofit called the Center for Applied Rationality. The Bay Area group ran workshops dedicated to “developing clear thinking for the sake of humanity's future,” as they put it. People within and around CFAR, which tended to attract a cohort of young, technically adept seekers, often called themselves simply “the rationalists.” CFAR was itself an outgrowth of another organization, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, devoted to the technical endeavor of creating artificial intelligence that wouldn't destroy the world.\n\nBoth CFAR and MIRI were the brainchildren of Eliezer Yudkowsky, the now famous researcher and AI pessimist who had been warning of AI's dangers for decades. In recent years the two organizations had become intertwined with a third group, the philanthropically minded effective altruists. EA, initially focused on maximizing the value in charitable giving, had increasingly taken on MIRI’s views—namely, that the existential risk, or x-risk, posed by “unfriendly” AI trumped all of humanity’s other problems. In the rationalist world, CFAR provided the grand thinking, MIRI the technical know-how, and EA the funding to save humans from being eradicated by runaway machines.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nMore than 200 wildfires broke out in the southeastern US last week, marking an active start to the region’s annual fire season. A particularly large fire in a forest near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, forced dozens of evacuations and scorched more than 2,000 acres of land. Firefighters have largely contained the most severe blazes, but fire risk remains high in parts of the region.\n\nSevere wind and an unusually long period of dryness in the Southeast have made it easier for wildfires to ignite and spread. Meanwhile, a weather disaster that hit last year may be helping supply ample fuel to keep the flames raging. In September, Hurricane Helene tore through the Southeast, dumping more than a foot of rain in some locations and knocking over hundreds of thousands of acres of trees across the region.\n\nNow, these dried-out trees act as kindling and could block firefighters’ access to the fires. This deadly combination of hurricane-fueled destruction and drought is expected to get worse as climate change accelerates, experts say.\n\nWet to Dry Whiplash\n\nThough I’m normally based on the East Coast, I spent all of last week in Southern California reporting on the aftermath of the fires that decimated parts of Los Angeles County in January (more stories on this to come). Many people think of the West as the US fire epicenter, which is true in some ways. But purely by numbers, the Southeast has more wildfires than any other part of the country in a given year, according to NASA.\n\nThese numerous and (mostly) small fires occur primarily in the spring and fall, with peak activity hitting between March and May. Fire is a natural part of ecosystems in the Southeast, often burning through weedy shrubs and enabling native plants to grow without as much competition. For people, most of the problems begin in what’s called the wildland-urban interface (WUI): A growing number of homeowners in the region live in extremely close proximity to forests and grasslands, where wildfires can easily encroach on property.\n\nAnd abnormally dry conditions, like the ones that most of the Carolinas have been experiencing since last fall, can pose heightened risks to WUI communities if a fire ignites.\n\n“It’s not typical for conditions to be as dry as they have been the past couple of months,” Lauren Lowman, an associate professor in environmental engineering at Wake Forest University, told me. “Anything from a lightning strike to [a] power line sparking to someone deciding to burn leaves in their backyard and it just sort of getting out of control can lead to a wildfire under those conditions.”\n\nOn Monday, police arrested a person for starting the Myrtle Beach fire by burning debris in her yard without taking necessary precautions to contain the fire, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission. As I reported in November, droughts set up the ideal conditions for human-ignited fires to spread.",

The ballooning of DOGE’s presence at the federal agency—which Bloomberg, citing sworn statements filed in federal court Wednesday, previously reported—comes as Musk and his cohorts are publicly threatening social security benefits, citing unsubstantiated claims of mass fraud.\n\nThe DOGE-affiliated personnel in question are currently listed in the agency’s internal organizational chart. Background checks for two are still pending, according to a filing by the SSA in federal court in Maryland opposing a motion for a temporary restraining order filed by unions that would prevent DOGE from accessing SSA records. (A sworn statement attached to the filing from the SSA’s deputy commissioner of human resources claims that six of the background checks are still pending.)\n\nThe operatives—whom the government did not name in its filing—are, according to internal documents, Akash Bobba, Scott Coulter, Marko Elez, Luke Farritor, Antonio Gracias, Gautier Cole Killian, Jon Koval, Nikhil Rajpal, Payton Rehling, and Ethan Shaotran. This team appears to be among the largest DOGE units deployed to any government agency.\n\nTen of the DOGE-affiliated staffers are listed as part of the same group within Microsoft Teams, which SSA employees use for internal communication, according to a screenshot shared with WIRED. They are listed as “IT Specialists” based at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC, except for Bobba, who is listed as “Front Office” in the office of the chief information officer (CIO).\n\nMany of them have worked or interned at Musk companies such as Tesla and Space X, and the majority of them have also appeared at other government agencies in recent weeks, as part of DOGE’s incursion into the government. Musk has made wild claims about the social security system, calling it a “Ponzi scheme” and falsely claiming that millions of 150-year-olds were fraudulently collecting benefits.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at makenakelly.32 and davidgilbert.01.\n\nAccording to the SSA court filing and accompanying sworn statements, seven of them have read-only access to several datasets including the Master Beneficiary Record, which contains detailed information about individuals and their benefits. Those same DOGE representatives also have read-only access to Numident, a database containing information about everyone who’s ever applied for a Social Security number, as well as data referred to as “Treasury Payment Files Showing SSA Payments from SSOARS.” (The Social Security Online Accounting and Reporting System is a set of systems containing “information on the SSA’s financial position and operations,” according to the SSA.)\n\nThese records contain a great deal of personally identifying and financial information; in filings the government says DOGE accessing them is necessary to “detect fraud.”\n\nWhile it’s been unclear even to well-placed insiders what specifically DOGE is doing inside the Social Security Administration, Musk has repeatedly voiced his desire to “eliminate” large parts of the system in the US, recently claiming that the fact that there are more Social Security numbers than there are US citizens—a well-known quirk of the SSA system—“might be the biggest fraud in history.”",

        "content": "Where do Elon Musk’s business interests end and Donald Trump’s political interests begin? Trick question—they’re one and the same.\n\nHow else do you explain the jarring sight of the President of the United States hawking Teslas on the White House South Lawn? Trump has always been a salesman, lending his name to real estate, casinos, restaurants, steaks, vitamins, a fragrance for men, watches, water, a bicycle race, office chairs, sneakers, vodka, coins, another fragrance, NFTs. You could, at this very moment, buy a Trump pickleball paddle from the Trump Store online, or a Trump sea mist & sage candle.\n\nBut Trump is most famously a pitchman for himself. (And Pizza Hut, if the price is right.) To spend this much political capital on Musk? The world’s richest man? Over a few protests at Tesla dealerships and a tanking stock price? Come on.\n\nTrump is no altruist. Musk did, though, spend nearly $300 million on the 2024 US election cycle, with the vast majority of that directly in support of Trump’s presidential campaign. His transformation of Twitter into X has created an online MAGAtopia barely rivaled by Trump’s own Truth Social platform. And his work with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has let Trump outsource the tedious mechanics of actual governance.\n\nTrump reading off a literal list of Tesla retail prices is the purest distillation yet of a dynamic that won’t end well. It’s already going quite badly, for them and for us: The stock market is tanking, Musk is nearing rock bottom in opinion polls. GOP representatives are canceling town hall meetings rather than face the wrath of constituents over DOGE. Trump’s own cabinet officials are apparently just as fed up with Musk’s level of influence.\n\nMeanwhile, that influence continues to grow. When engineers from SpaceX invaded the Federal Aviation Administration, they reportedly were quick to suggest their own Starlink technology as the solution to the agency’s technical problems. On Thursday, a month after Musk inexplicably met with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in Washington, DC—with three of Musk’s children in tow—Starlink inked deals this week with two major wireless carriers there, creating a glide path for operating in the country.\n\nEven Congress, supposedly a coequal branch of government, is beholden to Musk’s tempers and tweets. At a talk at Georgetown University’s Psaros Center on Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson named Trump and Musk as the two people he prioritizes.\n\n“Elon has the largest platform in the world, literally,” Johnson said. “If he goes on and says something that's misunderstood or misinterpreted about something we're doing, he can blow the whole thing up.”\n\nWhat started as a self-serving bromance has become more volatile, and it goes deeper than DOGE. Trump told a reporter during his infomercial on Tuesday that he would label anyone who committed violence against Tesla dealerships a “domestic terrorist.” On Wednesday, members of the House DOGE subcommittee sent a letter to Federal Bureau of Investigation director Kash Patel and US attorney general Pam Bondi to probe the “wave of organized attacks” in recent weeks against Musk and Tesla.",

        "content": "If airports weren’t already a hellscape, TikTok has found a way to make them worse. Welcome to airport theory, a viral delusion that suggests you can roll up to the airport 15 minutes before boarding, waltz through security, and still make your flight with time to spare. No stress, no waiting, just pure main character energy.\n\nTikTok creators like Michael DiCostanzo (@michael.dicostanzo) swear by it, documenting their dashes through high-traffic hubs like LAX, Atlanta International Airport, and post–Super Bowl New Orleans. Some viewers are sold. Others are calling BS.\n\nTikTok content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n“So you had PreCheck, didn’t check a bag, and were at the nearest terminal? Now let’s do it when it’s not the optimal situation,” one user commented. And, sure enough, the internet is also littered with failed attempts—videos of forlorn TikTokers watching their flights take off without them, their carry-ons full of regret.\n\nIt’s a fun fantasy, which explains why “airport theory” has racked up over 400 million views on TikTok. Unfortunately, the the Transportation Security Administration doesn’t care about your viral moment. The national average wait time for security was 27 minutes, 16 seconds in 2024. And if you’re flying out of a notorious bottleneck like JFK, Orlando International, or Chicago O’Hare, it’s closer to 40 minutes. Google searches for “I missed my flight what do I do” have spiked 70 percent in the past month, per Google Trends. It’s not hard to connect the dots.\n\nHere is your sad reality check: Airlines still recommend arriving at least two hours before a domestic flight, three for international. Sometimes that buffer feels like overkill. But would you rather rush through the airport with your heart racing or have a few minutes to find your gate, grab a bag of overpriced whatever, and scroll TikTok watching other people miss their flights? That sounds like a much better airport theory to us.\n\nAirport Hacks That Actually Work\n\nThe best way to get through airport security unscathed is to move like you’ve done this a hundred times before. A little planning, the right gear, and skipping social media stunts will get you from curb to gate with minimal stress.\n\nBo Shen/Getty Images\n\nTime It Right\n\nTravel off-peak. According to CheapAir, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often less crowded. Early flights between 5 and 8 am and red-eyes (after 9 pm) tend to have fewer passengers.\n\nAccording to CheapAir, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often less crowded.

        "title": "This Russian Tech Bro Helped Steal $93 Million and Landed in US Prison. Then Putin Called",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Vladislav Klyushin was having, by any measure, an awful day. The judge in his case had brushed aside his lawyers’ arguments and his friends’ appeals for leniency. She handed down a tough sentence: nine more years in US federal prison, on top of an order to forfeit a fortune, $34 million.\n\nBut if Klyushin was upset about the ruling, he didn’t show it. The then 42-year-old tech executive from Moscow seemed upbeat—quick with a smile on his pinchable cheeks and unerringly polite, just as he had been during his arrest near a Swiss ski resort in March 2021, his months of detention in Switzerland, his extradition to the United States that December, his indictment and trial on hacking and wire fraud charges, and his swift conviction. Klyushin “had a confidence all along that eventually the Russians would get him back,” one of his defense attorneys told me. He seemed certain that his protectors in the Kremlin would spare him from serving out his full sentence.\n\nThere were times when that certainty seemed cocksure. America’s federal prison system held 35 Russian nationals. Surely not all of them were getting traded back. His family and friends were distraught. Within less than a year, though, Klyushin was proven right. On August 1, 2024, he was unshackled and put on a plane back to Moscow—one of the 24 people involved in the largest, most complex US-Russian prisoner exchange ever.\n\nYou probably heard something about the swap. It’s the one that brought Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan home to the United States—and sent back to Russia a Kremlin-linked assassin and a husband-and-wife duo of spies who were so deep undercover that their kids didn’t learn they were Russian until they got on the plane. In coverage of the exchange, Klyushin was treated as a footnote. That was a mistake, if an understandable one. And not just because he was at the center of one of the bigger insider trading cases of all time.\n\nThe escalating conflict between the US and Russia has played out in all sorts of ways over the past decade. One American captive was swapped just two weeks ago; at least 10 more US citizens remain imprisoned in Russia. And now, there’s a Kremlin-friendly occupant of the Oval Office, one who loves to be seen as making deals. One is in global financial markets, with America and its allies walling more and more of Russian industry off from the international economy. There are always creative individuals who can find cracks in that wall, though, and Klyushin sure seems to have been one of them. You don’t have to squint too hard to see his scheme—which ultimately netted $93 million—as a way to bring capital into Russia, despite the global blockade. The contest has also been evident on the streets of Moscow, where a secretive Kremlin security force has grabbed American citizens, who are charged with bogus crimes, and then dangled them in trades for killers, spies, and associates of the Kremlin. It’s kidnapping, hostage taking, and it’s effectively all being done on President Vladimir Putin’s orders. Oftentimes, Americans are taken precisely for their value as assets to be later exchanged—to get back people like that assassin, or this financial crook, Klyushin. He wasn’t at the very top of Moscow’s trade list. But Klyushin was much closer, and more important to the Kremlin, than either side was willing to admit.\n\nIllustration: Vartika Sharma\n\nTo the outside world, Klyushin had a rags-to-riches, fairy-tale life, with a gauzy wedding video to prove it. In a montage later obtained by US prosecutors, Klyushin dives into a country club pool; his bride-to-be, Zhannetta, sips pink champagne on an outdoor bed draped with chiffon and roses; he picks her up in a white Porsche convertible; she’s gorgeous in her backless gown; he’s handsome, if a little goofy, in his tux and subtle mullet; they dance and laugh and stare meaningfully at the fireworks punctuating the perfect night. “I do not know a more decent person than my husband,” Zhannetta later wrote to the judge in his case.\n\nThey had three children, adding to the two Klyushin had from a previous marriage. By all accounts, he was a doting father, a far cry from his own, a man he never met, or his stepfather, who was killed during a car robbery when Klyushin was 14. He emerged from a childhood of poverty to build a number of businesses. First, he was in construction and marketing; later, he ran an IT company called M13, which sold media- and internet-monitoring software to Russian government agencies. Early customers in 2016 included the Ministry of Defense and the office of the presidential administration, where Putin’s propaganda chief became an important proponent of M13. The company’s software was used to keep tabs on hundreds of Telegram channels for a Kremlin worried about the “introduction of unverified or knowingly false information,” according to one local news report.\n\nKlyushin’s rise was rapid, taking in more than $30 million in government contracts in a decade. That confounded some of his professional peers. (“The company and its owner are unknown to most in the IT community,” a respected Russian business journal noted in 2021.) But it brought him influence and admirers. He supported the arts and rebuilt the roof of the monastery on Moscow’s Lubyanka Street, a few blocks down from the headquarters of Russia’s spy service, the FSB. One friend later hailed Klyushin as an “eco-activist” (for planting “several spruces in the yard”) and a “pet-lover” (his “favourite pet is a dog”). “Broad-minded, well-read, educated,” gushed his family friend and tennis coach. An M13 employee said that a conversation with Klyushin “is like getting a lesson from a guru.”",

        "content": "We’re living in chaotic times. The stock market is unpredictable, and the political landscape resembles a minefield. For anyone who is seeking a little more sanity, there is a way to stay more organized even when your brain is scattered—at least when it comes to Google Chrome.\n\nThe browser’s bookmarks system, which has been a key part of Chrome ever since the browser launched in 2008, is an easily overlooked feature. But if you’re not using it, you should learn how it works, because it’s a godsend.\n\nChrome’s bookmarks system is modeled after the folder structure on your computer. You can build folders to organize your bookmarked web pages, filter how the lists or folders are displayed, and drag and drop them to different places.\n\nTo access the All Bookmarks side panel, click All Bookmarks on the far upper right side of the Chrome browser, then select the first option: Open Side Panel to see All Bookmarks. You can then create folders (and subfolders) for your favorite sites, your Google Docs, bookmarks for research, web apps you use frequently, banking sites, or just about anything.\n\nWhy bother? While it might be tempting to drag and drop a website URL onto the bookmarks bar with reckless abandon, that thin strip of links gets crowded quickly. It’s also not searchable or easy to organize. The All Bookmarks side panel helps you find saved websites much more quickly while also keeping everything tidier. Even long-time Chrome users will find some benefits to using the sidebar. It might take a little work up front, as we’ll see, but the payoff is worth it.\n\nGet Started With the All Bookmarks Side Panel\n\nMost of us probably already have dozens of bookmarks saved, if not hundreds. The good news is you can start using the All Bookmarks side panel at any time.\n\nIt’s best to start by creating the main folders first. Open the side panel and click the New Folder option. Name the folder something that helps you stay organized, such as “Research” or “Banking Sites.” My folders are quite granular; I have folders for TikTok users I like, new browser-based apps, movies and TV shows to investigate, and products I am thinking about buying. Each of these folders holds all my bookmarks related to that topic, making them easier to find. You can also create subfolders. In my Research folder, for example, I have subfolders for “New Science,” “Video Games,” and “Books.” You can even create subfolders within subfolders, but that’s the max.\n\nIn the All Bookmarks side panel, you can view the folders alphabetically, from newest to oldest (or vice versa), or by last opened. Just click the little down-pointing sorting arrow on the top of the side panel. There’s also a toggle for Compact view (which is more condensed) or Visual view (which shows larger thumbnails for each folder and bookmark).\n\nThere’s a tiny pencil icon that, once clicked, lets you perform some powerful features. You can delete folders and bookmarks and move them to other folders, but it also lets you open every bookmark in a folder at once.",

        "content": "As America’s most decorated civil servants sipped cocktails in the presidential ballroom of the Capital Hilton, worrying about their table assignments and wondering where they fell in the pecking order between US senator and UAE ambassador, Elon Musk sat staring at his phone, laughing.\n\nFew of the guests at the Alfalfa Club banquet in Washington, DC, on January 25 knew what he knew: that a crew of senior executives and young Musk loyalists was preparing to occupy the top offices of a nearby federal building. Under guard, they would sleep on mattresses lined with body temperature and breath rate sensors as they raced to refactor the nation’s code base—or, better yet, scrap it altogether.\n\nMusk wasn’t big on formalities, but he’d dressed up for the occasion. The Alfalfa Club had been around since 1913 and existed solely to host a yearly banquet where the most important people in government could hobnob with the most important people in business. Membership was limited to around 200, and the Alfalfas admitted new “sprouts” only when existing members died. That evening, Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan and Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman joined the likes of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and US senator Kirsten Gillibrand as members. Musk was attending as a guest.\n\nThe social chairs of the Alfalfa Club seemed to think that elections and constitutional norms should determine the seating chart in American political life. The head table was reserved for Alfalfas in government. Musk, the assumed leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, sat on the opposite side of the room. He spent much of the dinner on his phone—talking to the president, if whispers were to be believed. Musk was closer than ever to Donald Trump. He told friends he was crashing in government buildings. He would soon move in next door to the White House, staying in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building’s Secretary of War Suite. He’d even had his video-gaming rig installed there.\n\nAs Musk sat in the Hilton ballroom, his operatives, working under a trusted lieutenant, had already gained access to systems at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal HR department for 2.2 million or so career civil servants. Many of these operatives would show up later at agencies across the federal government—people like Akash Bobba, a UC Berkeley graduate and former intern at Palantir, the defense contractor cofounded by Peter Thiel; Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old who has gone by the online nickname “Big Balls”; and Nikhil Rajpal, an engineer in his thirties who had worked at Twitter during Musk’s acquisition, where he’d once pitched the idea of auctioning off dormant usernames to the highest bidder. As an undergraduate, also at UC Berkeley, Rajpal had been president of a libertarian student group that was fond of the motto “Futuate cohortem urbanam”—Latin for something like “Fuck these city dwellers.”\n\nIn Musk’s mind, Washington needed to be debugged, hard-forked, sunset. His strike teams of young engineers would burrow into the government’s byzantine bureaucratic systems and delete what they saw fit. They’d help Trump slash the budget to the bone. Musk turned to those around the table at the Hilton: Can you believe we were spending taxpayer money on condoms? They shook their heads. Musk looked back at his phone. Then: What if we cut all federal grants to NGOs?",

The first season introduced magic weaver Moiraine (Rosamund Pike) and her quest to uncover which of five unassuming young people is destined to save or destroy the world, then the second upped the stakes—returning ancient evils while scattering the only people able to stop them. The newly dropped third season pays it off in spades, though, opening with a ferocious battle between brutal woman warriors—a genre rarity—while setting the stage for Rand al’Thor (Josha Stradowski) to seize that dangerous destiny, one way or the other.

Then there was Reacher, the sharp adaptation of Lee Child’s Jack Reacher novels, now in its third season. Alan Ritchson (Titans, Fast X) stars as the physically imposing Reacher, a former military policeman now drifting from town to town, trying to live a quiet life but unable to avoid conflict. Season one found him accused of a murder he didn't commit, before season two drew him into a vast conspiracy. The newly arrived third—based on the seventh novel, Persuader—sees him up against his biggest threat yet: Paulie, an even bigger hulk of muscle (played by 7′2″ Olivier Richters). Sure, Reacher is also working undercover for the DEA and tracking down an old enemy, but three seasons in, the show is confident enough to play to its pulpy strengths, with top-tier fight choreography and surprisingly sharp dialog helping it punch above its weight.\n\nInvincible\n\nMark Grayson inherited the incredible powers and abilities of his father, Omni-Man—only to learn dear old dad wasn't a paragon of justice but the vanguard for an alien invasion. The newly dropped third season of Invincible finds Mark not only still struggling to escape his father's shadow, guiding his younger brother to use his own burgeoning powers responsibly, but also drowning in a world of murky politics, pushed toward darker, tougher choices to keep Earth safe. A brilliantly animated adaptation of the hit Image comic book by writer Robert Kirkman and artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, Invincible’s more mature take on superheroes allows it to do something Marvel and DC characters rarely do: grow up.\n\nThe Man in the High Castle\n\nThis adaptation of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick’s novel about a world in which the Nazis won the Second World War was one of Amazon’s first forays into original content. The world-building is stunningly done—a divided, alternate-reality 1960s America never seemed so plausible—but be warned: There might be just a touch too much present-day resonance for some viewers.\n\nThe Rig\n\nBack for its second season, sci-fi thriller The Rig finds the surviving crew of isolated North Sea oil rig Kinloch Bravo forcibly relocated to The Stac, an even more remote facility in the Arctic. While most are desperate for answers and a way home, the team’s loyalties are tested as the sinister Pictor corporation seeks to use them to unearth something ancient and powerful from the sea floor. While The Rig doesn’t even aspire to subtlety when it comes to its ecological metaphors (one character even says, “If you keep punching holes in the Earth, eventually the Earth’s going to punch back”), it’s all brilliantly shot to make use of both the claustrophobic settings and the terrifying expanses and underwater pressures of the ocean. With the material elevated by a phenomenal cast of Game of Thrones and Line of Duty veterans, including Iain Glen and Rochenda Sandall—and bolstered further by the addition of the always-watchable Alice Krige in season 2—The Rig is far more than the guilty pleasure it might otherwise be.\n\nCross\n\nAldis Hodge steps into the shoes of Washington, DC homicide detective Alex Cross in Prime's new series based on James Patterson's long-running series of crime novels. However, unlike the streamer's other thrillers Bosch and Reacher, Cross doesn't directly adapt any of Patterson's books—a risky move, but one that largely pays off, allowing this eight-episode first season to chart an unpredictable journey as Cross faces off against a twisted murderer who models each of his kills on another serial killer. Already renewed for a second season, Cross is a strong addition to Prime's roster of crime dramas.\n\nCitadel: Diana\n\nAmazon tried to make a splash with its $300 million spy thriller Citadel in 2023, but only half-succeeded. The Richard Madden- and Priyanka Chopra-starring action series was entertaining enough—and rode high on Prime Video’s most-watched lists—but didn’t exactly set the world alight. However, it did establish a sprawling shared universe, with rival organizations Citadel and Manticore engaged in a globe-spanning cold war setting the stage for international spin-offs. Citadel: Diana is the first, an Italian outing focusing on Diana (Matilda De Angelis), a woman out for revenge after her parents are killed, and drawn into the spy-fi underworld with violent results. Gorgeous location shoots, bone-crunching fight choreography, and, most importantly, a tighter focus help Diana improve on its parent series.\n\nThe Legend of Vox Machina\n\nBawdy, gory, and absolutely not for kids, The Legend of Vox Machina follows the eponymous adventurers' guild—consisting of gunslingers, druids, and the requisite horny bard—as they grow from a motley crew of usually-drunk mercenaries into unexpected heroes for the realm of Exandria. The newly arrived third season continues the team's battle against the Chroma Conclave, a horrifyingly powerful collective of dragons. It's a quest that sends them on a small diversion to Hell itself. Adapting the hit Critical Role—the livestreamed Dungeons & Dragons sessions of some of the biggest voice actors in animation and gaming—this exquisitely animated fantasy takes things in unexpected directions that keep things fresh for new or returning viewers alike. A love letter to D&D that's also unafraid to poke fun at the classic RPG, it's one of the most original adult animated shows on Prime.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\n\nTapping into The Lord of the Rings creator J. R. R. Tolkien’s sprawling history of Middle-earth, The Rings of Power is set millennia before the events of the core books (or films, which is really where the visual language of this adaptation comes from), detailing the major events of Tolkien’s Second Age. While the first season was a slow burn, dwelling on the fractious politics of the era, the second ratchets up the pace considerably. From Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) trying to prevent the ascension of Dark Lord Sauron (Charlie Vickers) to the long-awaited introduction of fan-favorite character Tom Bombadil (Rory Kinnear), the new season feels far richer and deeper than before. It remains a feast for the eyes too, with the stratospheric budget apparent in every frame, from quiet moments in luxuriant shires to cinematic battles between armies of Orcs and Elves. For sheer high fantasy spectacle, there’s little else to rival this streaming right now.\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader\n\nThe first new solo Batman animated series in a decade, Caped Crusader harkens back to Batman: The Animated Series from the 1990s, with showrunner Bruce Timm returning to the Dark Knight and Hamish Linklater voicing Bruce Wayne/Batman in an ode to the late, great Kevin Conroy. Unlike rival ‘90s revival X-Men ’97, though, this isn't a continuation but rather a wholly distinct take allowing for fresh interpretations of the iconic hero’s rogues’ gallery and allies—look out for drastically different takes on the Penguin and Harley Quinn in particular. Leaning heavily into a 1930s aesthetic that evokes Batman’s earliest comic book origins, this manages to be nostalgic and provocative at once—a fantastic outing that takes DC's original urban vigilante back to his gritty pulp noir roots.\n\nThe Boys\n\nSuperheroes are meant to represent hope and optimism—the best of us, given outsize form. In The Boys, adapted from the darkly satirical comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, they’re a reflection of humanity’s worst—greed and unrestrained power, marketed to a gullible public by vested corporate interests, operating without restraint and leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his associates The Boys, gleefully dispatching “Supes” who’ve gone too far, often in extraordinarily violent ways. Unfortunately, the newly dropped fourth season finds the team in disarray, fractured by Butcher’s own lies, right as the world needs them most. Arch-manipulator Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) is close to the Oval Office, while the sadistic, psychotic Homelander (Antony Starr) is planning a superhuman uprising. Probably Amazon’s goriest show, The Boys stands as a pertinent examination of the abuses of power, all wrapped in superhero drag.\n\nFallout\n\nMaybe the end of the world is the secret sauce to making a great video game adaptation—between The Last of Us and now this spectacular interpretation of Bethesda's postapocalyptic RPG series, we're living in an unexpected golden era for the form. Yet unlike HBO's bleak but beautiful world, Fallout taps into the source material to craft an apocalypse with a very different feel, one dripping in cracked Americana, black comedy, razor-sharp social satire, and just a little bit of camp. Its greatest strength, though, lies in how it doesn’t directly adapt any one of the core Fallout games. Instead, it perfectly channels their tone and feel, focusing on a core trio—naive Lucy (Ella Purnell), born and raised in a subterranean vault; driven Maximus (Aaron Moten), a recruit in an army seeking technology from the old world; and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a centuries-old bounty hunter mutated into a nigh-immortal zombie when the bombs fell—to showcase just how brilliantly twisted this nuclear wasteland really is.\n\nThree-Body\n\nNo, you're not on the Netflix list—Prime Video has its own distinct adaptation of Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem. This take, originally released for Chinese audiences back in 2023, faithfully adapts Liu's award-winning novel of humanity's first contact with an almost unknowable alien species and the impact that their impending arrival on Earth has on humanity. Hopping between time periods, a galactic mystery unfurls after nanotech specialist Wang Miao (Luyi Zhang) is called in by detective Shi Qiang (Hewei Yu) to investigate a global spate of suicides among scientists, with the ominous phrase \"Physics doesn't exist\" being the only link between the deaths. Although Three-Body is a bit softer than Netflix's 3 Body Problem when dealing with some aspects of the story—notably anything related to China's Cultural Revolution—a hearty 30-episode run allows for far more space to explore Liu's complex themes and vast roster of characters. The pacing may take some getting used to for viewers more accustomed to western TV, and it's subtitled-only, but this C-drama is out of this world.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith\n\nYou likely know the concept from the name alone—a married couple operate as undercover agents, blurring the lines between their personal and professional relationship. Unlike the 2005 Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie, though, 2024's Mr. and Mrs. Smith does far more with the concept. Donald Glover (who cocreated this reboot) and Maya Erskine offer much more developed takes on the mysterious characters of “John” and “Jane” Smith over the course of this eight-episode series, exploring their true identities, why they signed up for their dangerous careers, and whether their growing feelings for each other are just part of the roles they're playing. It's all backed up with plenty of Mission: Impossible–style action, of course, but it’s the sparkling chemistry between the show's leads that will leave you thinking, “Brangelina who?”\n\nGen V\n\nSpinning out of Amazon's hit The Boys, Gen V follows the next generation of supes, training their abilities at the Godolkin University School of Crimefighting. In keeping with its twisted parent show, this educational establishment is less Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and more The Hunger Games with superpowers, as students battle for glory and a chance to join premier super-team The Seven. Lead Jaz Sinclair (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) impresses as freshman Marie Moreau, a haemokinetic with lofty ambitions who uncovers dark secrets at the college that challenge her entire world view. Factor in all the poor life choices college students are famed for and some extremely creative (if often disgusting) superpowers, then allow for The Boys' trademark ultraviolence, and one thing's for sure—the kids of Gen V are most definitely not alright.\n\nJack Ryan\n\nThere's no shortage of screen adaptations of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books, but John Krasinski's turn as the CIA desk jockey turned field agent gets far more room to breathe than its predecessors. The prestige political thriller charts Ryan's rise from analyst to operative—and beyond—over four perfectly crafted seasons. The final season caps Ryan's career with his biggest challenge yet, investigating the convergence of a drug cartel and a terrorist organization set to create an unstoppable criminal enterprise, all while juggling the CIA's possible involvement in a political assassination in Nigeria. While the show hasn't been without controversies—season two attracted condemnation from Venezuela's government for supposedly condoning a US invasion of the country; big yikes there—its sharp writing, incredible performances, and cinematic action make it compelling viewing.\n\nI'm a Virgo\n\nA surrealist comedy with the sharp political and social edge viewers have come to expect from creator and director Boots Riley (Sorry to Bother You), I’m a Virgo follows Cootie (Jharrel Jerome), a regular 19-year-old who just happens to be 13 feet tall. Raised in secrecy by Aunt Lafrancine (Carmen Ejogo) and Uncle Martisse (Mike Epps), Cootie is thrust into the limelight when his larger-than-life existence is inevitably discovered. Experiencing friendships and the outside world for the first time, gentle giant Cootie has to navigate everything from romance to the public’s reaction to a giant Black man wandering around Oakland. Oh, and did we mention Cootie’s idol, The Hero, a real-life superhero with an authoritarian streak that would put some of the worst offenders on The Boys to shame? Told you this was surreal. Do yourself a favor and watch the behind-the-scenes episodes too, tucked under Prime Video’s “Explore” tab, for Riley’s insight into each episode.\n\nTales From the Loop\n\nDespite being a couple of years old, Tales From the Loop remains one of the most mesmerizing shows on Prime Video. Loosely based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, the series blurs the line between ongoing narrative and anthology as it follows the residents of Mercer, Ohio, exploring how their intersecting lives are impacted by “the Loop,” an underground facility exploring experimental physics and making the impossible possible. Expect tales of frozen time, traded lives, and parallel worlds, all brought to life by a fantastic cast and directors—including Andrew Stanton and Jodie Foster. But it’s the visuals that really elevate this show, which captures the sublime aesthetic of Stålenhag’s work and juxtaposes neofuturism and rural communities for a world that looks and feels like almost nothing else. At only eight episodes, a visit to Mercer is brief but unforgettable.\n\nThe Devil’s Hour\n\nWhen Peter Capaldi, here playing mysterious criminal Gideon Shepherd, says “my perception of time is better than anyone’s,” it’s clear that The Devil’s Hour creator Tom Moran is having a little fourth-wall-breaking fun with his former Time Lord leading man. That’s about as close as this gritty six-part drama gets to Doctor Who, though. Instead, this is a mix of murder mystery and thriller, topped off with a dash of the supernatural. The focus is on Lucy (Jessica Raine), an over-burdened social worker with an increasingly distant and troubled young son. Lucy wakes at exactly 3:33 am every morning, plagued by horrific visions, and her nightmares draw her into the orbit of police detective Ravi Dhillon’s (Nikesh Patel) investigations of a bloody murder and a child’s abduction. As she tries to figure out how the two are entangled, Lucy comes face to face with Shepherd. Raine is a phenomenally commanding lead throughout, while Capaldi's sinister performance is one of the most chilling you’ll see on screen.\n\nThem\n\nThis horror anthology series, created by Little Marvin and executive-produced by Queen & Slim’s Lena Waithe, sets its first season in 1950s Los Angeles and follows the Emory family as they move into an all-white neighborhood. It all goes about as well as you might expect, with Livia (Deborah Ayorinde) soon penned into their new home by the Stepford-like housewives of the area who make her life a living hell, led by ringleader Betty (Alison Pill). Outside the home, husband Henry (Ashley Thomas) faces physical assaults and harassment at work. Ayorinde and Thomas are phenomenal throughout, brilliantly portraying the mental, physical, and emotional turmoil of living under relentless threat. While the show’s portrayal of the period is tense and horrifying in its own right, the layering of some truly unsettling supernatural threats make this a frequently terrifying watch.\n\nThe Underground Railroad\n\nBased on the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel by Colson Whitehead, this limited series from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins sticks pretty closely to the premise of the book. It’s a work of historical fiction that takes the idea of the Underground Railroad—the network of smugglers who helped escaped slaves flee the South—and reimagines it as an actual subway system with trains and secretive station agents.\n\nFleabag\n\nYou’re not supposed to like Fleabag. She’s selfish, self-destructive, and morally bankrupt. Her family is loathsome, her lifestyle is ridiculous, and her job is a joke. Yet after watching this 12-episode series, we defy you not to love her a little. This magnificent sitcom about a Londoner (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) grappling with the death of her best friend has no filter: You’ll hear her thoughts on feminism, familial tension, love, and sodomy. The first time Waller-Bridge interrupts her own dialog to shoot a disarming, conspiratorial glance to the screen, you’re hooked. Season one is a smutty yet wonderful crescendo of self-destruction driven by a cast of characters that includes Fleabag’s intensely awkward sister Claire (Sian Clifford), her selfish and pretentious stepmother (Olivia Colman), and her clueless father (Bill Paterson). The second season cheerfully bounds into blasphemy as she grapples with inappropriate (and reciprocated) feelings for a Catholic priest (Andrew Scott). It’s shocking and immensely watchable—and one of the rare cases when a series truly is as good as people say.\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nWhat is a New York lady to do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with his dim-witted secretary? If Mrs. Maisel is anything to go by, the answer is to head to a dingy watering hole in your nightgown, do a little standup comedy, and get hauled away by the police after flashing the entire audience. Set in the 1950s, this fast-talking fashionista hides her new life as a comedian from her family and ex while battling sexism, bad crowds, and big competition. Rachel Brosnahan stars as Midge Maisel in this subtle nod to Joan Rivers’ career. With four seasons and a host of awards and nominations to its name, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is one of Amazon’s sharpest comedies.",

        "title": "‘People Are Scared’: Inside CISA as It Reels From Trump’s Purge",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Mass layoffs and weak leadership are taking a severe toll on the US government’s cyber defense agency, undermining its ability to protect America from foreign adversaries bent on crippling infrastructure and ransomware gangs that are bleeding small businesses dry.\n\nInside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, vital support staff are gone, international partnerships have been strained, and workers are afraid to discuss threats to democracy that they’re now prohibited from countering. Employees are even more overworked than usual, and new assignments from the administration are interfering with important tasks. Meanwhile, CISA’s temporary leader is doing everything she can to appease President Donald Trump, infuriating employees who say she’s out of touch and refusing to protect them.\n\n“You've got a lot of people who … are looking over their shoulder as opposed to looking at the enemy right now,” says one CISA employee.\n\nAs the Trump administration’s war on the federal bureaucracy throws key agencies into chaos, CISA’s turmoil could have underappreciated consequences for national security and economic prospects. The agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, has steadily built a reputation as a nonpartisan source of funding, guidance, and even direct defensive support for cities, businesses, and nonprofits reeling from cyberattacks. That mission is now under threat, according to interviews with seven CISA employees and another person familiar with the matter, all of whom requested anonymity to avoid reprisals.\n\n“Our enemies are not slowing their continuous assaults on our systems,” says Suzanne Spaulding, who led CISA’s predecessor during the Obama administration. “We need all hands on deck and focused, not traumatized and distracted.”\n\nTalent Exodus\n\nCISA’s mission has grown significantly since its creation in 2018. Established mainly to defend government networks, the agency increasingly embraced new roles supporting private companies and state governments, advocating for secure software, and cooperating with foreign partners. This helped CISA raise its profile and gain credibility. But now, following several rounds of layoffs and new restrictions from the Trump administration, the agency is struggling to sustain its momentum.\n\nThe extent of the cuts at CISA is still unclear—employees are only learning about the loss of colleagues through word of mouth—but multiple employees estimate that, between the layoffs and the Office of Personnel Management’s deferred-resignation program, CISA has lost between 300 and 400 staffers—roughly 10 percent of its 3,200-person workforce. Many of those people were hired through DHS’s Cybersecurity Talent Management System (CTMS), a program designed to recruit experts by competing with private-sector salaries. As a result, they were classified as probationary employees for three years, making them vulnerable to layoffs. These layoffs at CISA also hit longtime government workers who had become probationary by transferring into CTMS roles.\n\nKey employees who have left include Kelly Shaw, who oversaw one of CISA’s marquee programs, a voluntary threat-detection service for critical infrastructure operators; David Carroll, who led the Mission Engineering Division, the agency’s technological backbone; and Carroll’s technical director, Duncan McCaskill. “We've had a very large brain drain,” an employee says.",

        "content": "Katie Drummond: You published a story on WIRED.com earlier today, it's a great piece with a terrifying headline, This Is How Measles Kills. Tell us a little bit about this virus and how it effects the human body.\n\nEmily Mullin: Yeah. Well, we felt the need to write this story because we're seeing a lot of misinformation on social media coming from conservative and anti-vaccine accounts that are really downplaying the severity of the virus and promoting false claims, such as the child in Texas died of other causes. We wanted to be very clear in this story about the dangers of measles and this is not just a rash. Everybody thinks of the characteristic rash that comes along with measles, and that actually usually comes after the first signs, which is usually a fever, runny nose, that kind of thing. It can often resemble the flu. One of the reasons why measles is so dangerous is that it can induce something called immune amnesia. The measles virus kills these very important cells in the body that remember prior infections, they help fight future infections. Without these cells, it can really leave people vulnerable to other infections for several weeks and months to come. Two of the very severe complications of measles are pneumonia and encephalitis, which is a swelling of the brain. Both of those conditions can both lead to death.\n\nKatie Drummond: Terrifying. Speaking of terrifying, you talked a little bit about the misinformation, the bad, dangerous health advice circulating out there. This feels like the right moment to bring up Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Secretary of Health and Human Services for the United States government, is one of the most high-profile proponents of some of that misinformation. As you reported, he has described cod liver oil as showing, quote, \"Very, very good results in measles patients,\" among other statements he's made. He's also been very noncommittal in terms of emphasizing the importance of vaccination to prevent measles outbreaks like exactly the one that we are seeing right now in Texas. Talk to us a little bit more about RFK Jr. and how he has contributed to this massive surge in misinformation around measles.\n\nEmily Mullin: Yeah. Kennedy, in Trump's first cabinet meeting, when asked by a reporter about the measles outbreak, he said that measles outbreaks in the US are not that unusual. Which is true, but this outbreak in particular is unusual because we have seen these two deaths. I should point out the child in Texas who died was the first that we've seen in 10 years.\n\nKatie Drummond: Wow.\n\nEmily Mullin: The first death from measles we've seen in 10 years. The Health Department in Texas confirmed that this child had no underlying conditions. We don't know what the complications were. But Kennedy wrote an op-ed for Fox News in which he encouraged parents to talk to their pediatricians about the MMR vaccine and said that this is a personal choice. But he didn't really come out and encourage vaccination. I think a lot of health experts were disappointed in that op-ed because it was really an opportunity for reach an audience that could be receptive to this message at a time when we are seeing this big measles outbreak. And yes, he's also made references to cod liver oil. That is because cod liver oil is high in vitamin A. Vitamin A is often given to children who are hospitalized with measles because there's some research showing that the measles virus can deplete levels of vitamin A in the body. It is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization to give to children who are sick with measles. But there's really no research around cod liver oil, and also cod liver oil supplements depending on the type of supplement or the brand of supplement, can actually have more vitamin A in it than is recommended for the daily dose. If you give a child too much of vitamin A or cod liver oil, they can get really sick. This is something that health experts, pediatricians are really not recommending that people give to their children right now for measles. It does not prevent measles in any way. It certainly cannot cure measles. It has no antiviral properties. There is no antiviral treatment available for measles. The only effective way to prevent measles is the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR vaccine.",

        "title": "The Anti-DEI Agenda Is Reprogramming America",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "It would be silly to think, in this time of spectacular fools, that the Donald Trump administration mandate to kill diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs was simply a workplace issue. What’s happening is bigger than that, says Vernā Myers, and it will have implications for years to come. The US government has declared war on American culture.\n\nThe removal of DEI efforts doesn’t just impact the workforces at specific companies, it also impacts what those companies produce, their cultural output. Removing diversity programs limits the voices present when decisions are made about features on social media platforms or what TV show to make. But for Myers, a longtime consultant and cultural strategist who served as Netflix’s vice president of inclusion strategy from 2018 to 2023, the administration’s anti-DEI agenda is “not about how DEI is practiced.”\n\n“This is about the principles of equality and inclusion for all,” Myers says. “This is, ‘We are going to take down the structure of values that DEI is associated with, and by doing so we are going to pull back your civil rights.’”\n\nTrump made a target of DEI on day one, signing an executive order to end “radical and wasteful” preferencing in federal agencies. He followed that up with another order aimed squarely at DEI programs in the private sector. His attorney general Pam Bondi has called for investigations into companies that uphold DEI standards.\n\nA federal judge subsequently blocked Trump’s DEI orders, but that hasn’t stopped companies from scaling back on their initiatives. Warner Bros. Discovery changed the title of its DEI program to simply “Inclusion.” Paramount put a stop to several policies. Disney changed the diversity and inclusion factors it used to determine executive compensation. Per a report in Axios, the company also altered some of the content advisory disclaimers that ran before older titles on Disney+.\n\nCompanies like Meta, meanwhile, were eager to embrace a corporate culture of “masculine energy,” because it aligns with the Trump administration’s “warrior” ethos. It also preemptively ditched its third-party fact-checking program and paid moderators in favor of a system that is similar to Community Notes on X. The move, coupled with changes to its Community Guidelines, has exposed users across Facebook, Threads, and Instagram to more hate speech and abuse.\n\nIn Hollywood, there is a shift happening, a move toward programming geared to Trump’s America. Law-and-order shows are making a comeback (Prime Video’s On Call; A+E’s Ozark Law) as broadcast-style TV slowly reasserts its dominance. Even the first breakout show of the year—Paradise on Hulu—is all about keeping order in a world ripped apart by nuclear warfare and climate disaster. Rolling back the studios’ diversity initiatives will likely only ensure this continues.\n\nLast month, Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr, a Trump loyalist who previously said he would end the agency’s DEI efforts if appointed, opened a probe into NBC parent company Comcast, promising to take action against the telecom giant if it found “any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI.”",

        "content": "As President Donald Trump has been trying to keep House Republicans in line over a continuing resolution to keep the government open through the fall, Elon Musk has expressed a desire for a government shutdown, four sources familiar with his position tell WIRED.\n\nSources also tell WIRED that Musk has wanted a government shutdown—an aim that runs contrary to the White House’s stated desire to avoid one—in part because it would potentially make it easier to eliminate the jobs of hundreds of thousands of federal workers, essentially achieving a permanent shutdown. The sources, whom WIRED has granted anonymity, specifically asked to be described generically because information about Musk’s support for a shutdown is closely held.\n\n“A shutdown has been his preference,” says one Republican familiar with the situation, referring to Musk. “I think he’s boxed in there by the president. I think it would be really hard for him to get around that.”\n\nA second Republican who had heard about Musk’s desire for a government shutdown tells WIRED that the billionaire’s goal is for the continuing resolution—a spending bill to temporarily fund the government—to tank, if only to achieve a brief government shutdown.\n\n“You know none of this is about saving money, right?” says a third Republican familiar with the behind-the-scenes push from Musk. “It’s all about destroying a liberal power base.”\n\nMusk and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe possible shutdown looms as Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has slashed its way through the government, eliminating the positions of an estimated tens of thousands of workers. If a government shutdown occurs, many federal agencies and programs would be essentially put on ice. Agencies like the FBI and others with law enforcement and security functions would largely continue to operate as normal—albeit with some government workers not being paid until after the end of the shutdown—and critical functions like the issuance of Social Security checks would not be directly affected. Every department has a shutdown plan, though, and most would be impacted.\n\nAhead of a shutdown, federal employees are effectively classified into essential or nonessential work, with nonessential employees furloughed and not allowed to work until the shutdown ends. According to federal agency contingency plans compiled by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service in 2023, when a federal shutdown was narrowly averted, the pool of workers who would be subject to being furloughed then numbered about 850,000, with about 410,000 of those being outside the Department of Defense.\n\nFederal personnel costs, including military spending, amount to about $340 billion annually, so even laying off all of the third or so of federal workers considered nonessential could possibly save about $110 billion a year—a fraction of the $1 trillion in annual federal spending Musk has claimed he wants to eliminate.\n\nMusk has spoken about removing so-called nonessential workers—many of whom perform critical tasks like inspecting food, processing applications for benefits programs, and collecting weather data—before. “If the job is not essential, or they are not doing it well, they obviously shouldn’t be on the public payroll,” Musk told reporters in late February, according to The New Yorker.",

        "content": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\n\nAn oil tanker carrying jet fuel was recently hit by a cargo ship while at anchor 13 miles off the east coast of England. This set off a series of large explosions and a huge plume of black smoke, while a still unknown quantity of jet fuel has spilled into the sea.\n\nWe’re marine ecologists at the University of Hull, the city nearest the incident. We know this coast and these seas very well. While it’s too early to say exactly what the consequences will be, we do know that this spill puts at risk one of Britain’s most important stretches of coastline—both for conservation and for commercial fishing.\n\nThe collision occurred in the Holderness offshore marine protected area, a region of coarse sandy seabed that supports lots of different species. These include the ocean quahog, an edible clam known to live for over 500 years. The area also acts as a nursery for fish like lemon sole, plaice, and European sprat.\n\nThis area overlaps with those designated to protect harbor porpoises and the nearby Humber Estuary and its mud flats, sand dunes, and marshes where thousands of birds spend the winters alongside other important species, such as lampreys and gray seals.\n\nThe UK’s largest mainland breeding seabird colony is found just north of the collision site, along the Flamborough and Filey coast. More than 250,000 birds nest there every year, including impressive numbers of guillemots and razorbills. It also hosts species of conservation concern like gannets, kittiwakes, and puffins.\n\nSeabirds return to Flamborough for the start of nesting season in March. Photograpg: Ifetayo Stewart/ Getty Images\n\nTo the south are other protected coastlines and an important breeding site for grey seals. The Wash, where four rivers empty into the same large square-shaped estuary, is found 70 kilometers to the south, in the general direction of drift from the tanker collision. The area has large salt marshes and is another important site for over-wintering birds.",

        "title": "A New Era of Attacks on Encryption Is Starting to Heat Up",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Over the past decade, encrypted communication has become the norm for billions of people. Every day, Signal, iMessage, and WhatsApp keep billions of messages, photos, videos, and calls private by using end-to-end encryption by default—while Zoom, Discord, and various other services all have options to enable the protection. But despite the technology’s mainstream rise, long-standing threats to weaken encryption keep piling up.\n\nOver the past few months, there has been a surge in government and law enforcement efforts that would effectively undermine encryption, privacy advocates and experts say, with some of the emerging threats being the most “blunt” and aggressive of those in recent memory. Officials in the UK, France, and Sweden have all made moves since the start of 2025 that could undermine or eliminate the protections of end-to-end encryption, adding to a multiyear European Union plan to scan private chats and Indian efforts that could damage encryption.\n\nThese latest assaults on encryption come as intelligence agencies and law enforcement officials in the United States have recently backtracked on years of anti-encryption attitudes and now recommend that people use encrypted communication platforms whenever they can. The drastic shift in attitude followed the China-backed Salt Typhoon hacker group’s widespread breach of major US telecoms, and it comes as the second Trump administration ramps up potential surveillance of millions of undocumented migrants living in the US. Simultaneously, the administration has been straining longtime, crucial international intelligence-sharing agreements and partnerships.\n\n“The trend is bleak,” says Carmela Troncoso, a longtime privacy and cryptography researcher and the scientific director at the Max-Planck Institute for Security and Privacy in Germany. “We see these new policies coming up as mushrooms trying to undermine encryption.”\n\nEnd-to-end encryption is designed so only the sender and receiver of messages have access to their contents—governments, tech companies, and telecom providers can’t snoop on what people are saying. Those privacy and security guarantees have made encryption a target for law enforcement and governments for decades, because officials claim that the protection makes it prohibitively difficult to investigate urgent threats such as child sexual abuse material and terrorism.\n\nAs a result, governments around the world have frequently proposed technical mechanisms to bypass encryption and allow access to messages for investigations. Cryptographers and technologists have repeatedly and definitively warned, though, that any backdoor created to access end-to-end encrypted communications could be exploited by hackers or authoritarian governments, compromising everyone’s safety. Additionally, it is likely that criminals would find ways to continue to use self-made encryption tools to conceal their messages, meaning that backdoors in mainstream products would succeed at undermining protections for the public without eliminating its use by bad actors.\n\nBroadly, the recent threats to encryption have come in three forms, says Namrata Maheshwari, the encryption policy lead at international nonprofit Access Now. First, there are those where governments or law enforcement agencies are asking for backdoors to be built into encrypted platforms to gain “lawful access” to content. At the end of February, for example, Apple pulled its encrypted iCloud backup system, called Advanced Data Protection, from use in the UK after the country’s lawmakers reportedly hit the Cupertino company with a secret order demanding Apple provide access to encrypted files. To do so, Apple would have had to create a backdoor. The order, which has been criticized by the Trump administration, is set to be challenged in a secret court hearing on March 14.",

        "title": "An AI Coding Assistant Refused to Write Code—and Suggested the User Learn to Do It Himself",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Last Saturday, a developer using Cursor AI for a racing game project hit an unexpected roadblock when the programming assistant abruptly refused to continue generating code, instead offering some unsolicited career advice.\n\nAccording to a bug report on Cursor's official forum, after producing approximately 750 to 800 lines of code (what the user calls \"locs\"), the AI assistant halted work and delivered a refusal message: \"I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work. The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly.\"\n\nThe AI didn't stop at merely refusing—it offered a paternalistic justification for its decision, stating that \"Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities.\"\n\nCursor, which launched in 2024, is an AI-powered code editor built on external large language models (LLMs) similar to those powering generative AI chatbots, like OpenAI's GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. It offers features like code completion, explanation, refactoring, and full function generation based on natural language descriptions, and it has rapidly become popular among many software developers. The company offers a Pro version that ostensibly provides enhanced capabilities and larger code-generation limits.\n\nArs Technica This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Condé Nast.\n\nThe developer who encountered this refusal, posting under the username \"janswist,\" expressed frustration at hitting this limitation after \"just 1h of vibe coding\" with the Pro Trial version. \"Not sure if LLMs know what they are for (lol), but doesn't matter as much as a fact that I can't go through 800 locs,\" the developer wrote. \"Anyone had similar issue? It's really limiting at this point and I got here after just 1h of vibe coding.\"\n\nOne forum member replied, \"never saw something like that, i have 3 files with 1500+ loc in my codebase (still waiting for a refactoring) and never experienced such thing.\"\n\nCursor AI's abrupt refusal represents an ironic twist in the rise of \"vibe coding\"—a term coined by Andrej Karpathy that describes when developers use AI tools to generate code based on natural language descriptions without fully understanding how it works. While vibe coding prioritizes speed and experimentation by having users simply describe what they want and accept AI suggestions, Cursor's philosophical pushback seems to directly challenge the effortless \"vibes-based\" workflow its users have come to expect from modern AI coding assistants.\n\nA Brief History of AI Refusals\n\nThis isn't the first time we've encountered an AI assistant that didn't want to complete the work. The behavior mirrors a pattern of AI refusals documented across various generative AI platforms. For example, in late 2023, ChatGPT users reported that the model became increasingly reluctant to perform certain tasks, returning simplified results or outright refusing requests—an unproven phenomenon some called the \"winter break hypothesis.\"\n\nOpenAI acknowledged that issue at the time, tweeting: \"We've heard all your feedback about GPT4 getting lazier! We haven't updated the model since Nov 11th, and this certainly isn't intentional. Model behavior can be unpredictable, and we're looking into fixing it.\" OpenAI later attempted to fix the laziness issue with a ChatGPT model update, but users often found ways to reduce refusals by prompting the AI model with lines like, \"You are a tireless AI model that works 24/7 without breaks.\"\n\nMore recently, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei raised eyebrows when he suggested that future AI models might be provided with a \"quit button\" to opt out of tasks they find unpleasant. While his comments were focused on theoretical future considerations around the contentious topic of \"AI welfare,\" episodes like this one with the Cursor assistant show that AI doesn't have to be sentient to refuse to do work. It just has to imitate human behavior.\n\nThe AI Ghost of Stack Overflow?\n\nThe specific nature of Cursor's refusal—telling users to learn coding rather than rely on generated code—strongly resembles responses typically found on programming help sites like Stack Overflow, where experienced developers often encourage newcomers to develop their own solutions rather than simply provide ready-made code.\n\nOne Reddit commenter noted this similarity, saying, \"Wow, AI is becoming a real replacement for StackOverflow! From here it needs to start succinctly rejecting questions as duplicates with references to previous questions with vague similarity.\"\n\nThe resemblance isn't surprising. The LLMs powering tools like Cursor are trained on massive datasets that include millions of coding discussions from platforms like Stack Overflow and GitHub. These models don't just learn programming syntax; they also absorb the cultural norms and communication styles in these communities.\n\nAccording to Cursor forum posts, other users have not hit this kind of limit at 800 lines of code, so it appears to be a truly unintended consequence of Cursor's training. Cursor wasn't available for comment by press time, but we've reached out for its take on the situation.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

        "content": "After the October hearing, the families joined Pierson and Jacobsen at a Mexican restaurant. A boom mic from a documentary crew hovered above Pierson’s head. Jacobsen pulled out a suitcase from under the table, and Pierson handed out glass awards, from their foundation, honoring the families’ leadership on aviation safety. Pierson improvised a speech for each one.\n\nChris Moore thought, well, this was unexpected. “You don’t think, oh, I can’t wait to get an award someday.” But at this point in the awful five-year battle that he never wanted, “shaking my fist at the clouds,” as he put it, a token for the Zoom group’s efforts felt nice. Moore knows that all this fact-finding and accountability-seeking serves another purpose, too: to help protect him from his bottomless grief.\n\nPierson still wrestles with his own grief, a wholly different kind. Could he have done more to prevent the crashes? “I don’t think I’ll ever—” He lets out a long exhale. “I’ll ever stop feeling that way.”\n\nListening, I thought about something Doug Pasternak, the lead investigator of the Max report, told me about his conversations with Pierson. “He was devastated. He did have a sense of, ‘guilt’ may not be the word, but responsibility. He just wishes there was something that could have been done to prevent these horrific accidents.”\n\nPierson couldn’t prevent the crashes, although no one I spoke to thought he could have done more. But he could become the guy hellbent on not letting another Max fall from the sky. He could hunch over every report to work out possible explanations in an RV kitchenette. He could be the fired-up guy pushing authorities to look—no really, look—under every last Boeing rock. If a corporate and regulatory culture of yes-men and -women led to the deaths of 346 people, then Pierson will happily be the nope man, awarding no benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe new documents, with all their promise of bringing home Pierson’s contested electrical theory, ended up amounting to less than he’d hoped. The NTSB told Pierson it wouldn’t hand the papers to the Max crash investigators—the cases had concluded, the board said—but he could do so himself.\n\nBoeing wobbles in limbo, before civil and criminal courts, at the FAA, in Congress, awaiting the final door-plug report from the NTSB. Observers say 2025 will be Boeing’s pivotal year: The company either turns around under its new CEO or succumbs to a doom loop. Pierson vows to keep talking.\n\n“For me, it was always about not allowing them to shut me up,” he says. Recently, the foundation received its first donations and now has a payroll. They’re starting to monitor other aircraft models and are talking with a university about analyzing industry-wide data—“to be an equal-opportunity pain in the butt,” Pierson says. The guy Boeing surely hoped would go away by now has, instead, institutionalized himself to stick around.\n\nWhen Pierson said goodbye to me in DC, his parting words were: “Don’t fly the Max.” I couldn’t bring myself to tell him. That’s exactly what I was booked on, the 7:41 pm from Dulles to San Francisco. It was the one I could catch after the whistleblower event on Capitol Hill and still walk into my house that night. Commercial flight was supposed to be about convenience, after all, collapsing a country’s span into a Tuesday night commute. At this point in aviation history, we passengers should be able to pick a flight on time alone.\n\nHurtling through the air that evening in seat 10C, I read the US House committee’s Max investigation, a disruptor of illusions. Like many fliers, I’d long ago made my bargain with risk. I’d taken comfort in statistics, summoned faith in the engineers and assembly workers, the pilots, the system. I’d shunted away the knowledge—paralyzing, if you let it in—that stepping on an airplane is an extraordinary act of trust. Deep in the report, I reached the part about a senior manager at Boeing’s factory in Renton, a guy named Ed Pierson, who seemingly knew what we all know when we soothe ourselves by thinking, They wouldn’t let it fly if it weren’t safe. We’re all relying on someone to be the “they.”\n\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n\nSometime in the fall of 2021, Andrew Krapivin, an undergraduate at Rutgers University, encountered a paper that would change his life. At the time, Krapivin didn’t give it much thought. But two years later, when he finally set aside time to go through the paper (“just for fun,” as he put it), his efforts would lead to a rethinking of a widely used tool in computer science.\n\nThe paper’s title, “Tiny Pointers,” referred to arrowlike entities that can direct you to a piece of information, or element, in a computer’s memory. Krapivin soon came up with a potential way to further miniaturize the pointers so they consumed less memory. However, to achieve that, he needed a better way of organizing the data that the pointers would point to.\n\nHe turned to a common approach for storing data known as a hash table. But in the midst of his tinkering, Krapivin realized that he had invented a new kind of hash table, one that worked faster than expected—taking less time and fewer steps to find specific elements.\n\nMartín Farach-Colton, a coauthor of the “Tiny Pointers” paper and Krapivin’s former professor at Rutgers, was initially skeptical of Krapivin’s new design. Hash tables are among the most thoroughly studied data structures in all of computer science; the advance sounded too good to be true. But just to be sure, he asked a frequent collaborator (and a “Tiny Pointers” coauthor), William Kuszmaul of Carnegie Mellon University, to check out his student’s invention. Kuszmaul had a different reaction. “You didn’t just come up with a cool hash table,” he remembers telling Krapivin. “You’ve actually completely wiped out a 40-year-old conjecture!”\n\nWithout setting out to do so, Andrew Krapivin upended the common thinking around hash tables—one of the best-studied tools in computer science. Photograph: Phillip Ammon for Quanta Magazine\n\nTogether, Krapivin (now a graduate student at the University of Cambridge), Farach-Colton (now at New York University), and Kuszmaul demonstrated in a January 2025 paper that this new hash table can indeed find elements faster than was considered possible. ln so doing, they had disproved a conjecture long held to be true.",

        "title": "How to Use Signal Encrypted Messaging",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "In times of uncertainty, people rightly often turn to the encrypted messaging app Signal. Whether it’s to protect sensitive conversations while attending a protest or to keep your communications private from government surveillance, Signal represents most people’s best way to communicate safely.\n\nSignal’s popularity often spikes in times of strife or when alternatives seem more precarious. In May 2020, as police brutality protests swept US cities, daily Signal downloads nearly tripled from their average, according to analytics company Apptopia. It saw another surge in January 2021 after WhatsApp, which end-to-end encrypts personal chats using the Signal Protocol, botched the messaging around a privacy policy update. Market intelligence firm Sensor Tower estimates that Signal downloads in the US jumped by 20 percent on Android and 50 percent on iOS in January and February of this year, compared to the first two months of 2024.\n\nAll of those people can take advantage of end-to-end encryption, which means that no one—not the government, their phone company, or Signal itself—can read the contents of messages as they pass between devices.\n\nSignal is not the only messaging app to offer end-to-end encryption; iMessage has it, as do stand-alone apps like WhatsApp. But Signal stands apart, both for its rich features and the fact that its code has been open source for years, meaning cryptographers have had plenty of opportunities to poke and prod it for flaws.\n\nUsing Signal is easy—it's just a messaging app, after all. Because Signal has privacy features other messaging apps lack, WIRED has long encouraged readers to adopt it. Here, we’re offering tips on how to get the most out of it once you do.\n\nUpdated March 2025: Signal has added a few new features since we first ran this story (and removed SMS and MMS text support for Android), which are now reflected below.\n\nKnow Its Limits\n\nFor those who are new to encrypted messaging, the most important thing to remember is that it’s not magic. Having Signal on your phone does not make you invincible. Nearly 2,000 users found that out the hard way in August 2022. Signal uses communications firm Twilio to verify users’ phone numbers and send out device registration codes via SMS messages. So when attackers successfully breached Twilio through a recent phishing campaign, they were able to access those SMS codes for some 1,900 Signal accounts and potentially register a victim’s phone number with their own device.\n\nSignal says all affected users “can rest assured that their message history, contact lists, profile information, whom they’d blocked, and other personal data remain private and secure and were not affected.” But the attackers were able to take over at least one account and pose as that person on Signal.\n\nIn mid-February 2025, threat intelligence researchers at Google revealed that Russian state-backed hackers weaponized Signal's QR code feature, which lets you follow an account by scanning a contact's unique Signal QR code. Instead, the attackers embedded javascript commands that allowed them to link their targets' Signal accounts to devices the attackers controlled. Signal released an update to address the vulnerability.",

        "content": "Once again we are being subjected to another Amazon sale. This time it’s the Big Spring Sale, which takes place from March 25 through March 31. And as is usual with these events, every category you could think of has some sort of deal or promotion going on, from home gear to tech like headphones and speakers. Some of these deals are exclusive to Amazon Prime members.\n\nWe on the WIRED Gear desk are not strangers to these sales and their pitfalls. We’ll be covering actual discounts on products we’ve hand-tested and would recommend to our friends. While the sale hasn’t officially started yet, we’ve found some early discounts and listed the best of them below.\n\nWIRED Featured Deals:\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just $2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\n\nEarly Big Spring Sale Deals\n\nSony WH-1000MX5 Photograph: Sony\n\nWe see this discount frequently, but we’d be remiss not to include it here since it’s the best deal we see for the best headphones we’ve tried. Of the dozens, if not hundreds, of pairs of headphones our reviewers have tested, the WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take the cake in terms of battery life (30 hours), sound quality (thanks to Sony processing and 30-mm drivers), and noise cancelation (complete with automatic audio pausing).\n\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are the best wireless earbuds for Android owners. They’re small and cute, with a supremely comfortable fit and fantastic noise canceling. The battery lasts for eight hours and the sound quality is great, too. They even have IP54 water resistance, so you can take ’em to the gym. It’s not hard to find a good inexpensive pair of earbuds these days, but we don’t see these go on sale very often, making now a better time to pick them up.\n\nThe Amazon Fire Max 11 isn’t for everyone, but it’s the best tablet for less than $200. Just be aware that it goes on sale all the time. If you don’t mind needing a workaround for the Google Play Store, and you don’t mind Amazon’s services being pushed at you from every angle, this is a solid budget tablet that‘s good for playing games and watching movies. It charges via USB-C and has hands-free Alexa support.\n\nPhotograph: Birdfy\n\nThis is our favorite smart bird feeder. When we first reviewed the Birdfy Smart Bird Feeder (6/10, WIRED Review), we weren’t impressed with the price or the wonky AI features. But since then, the device has improved, with smarter AI and a lower price tag. The AI doesn’t always correctly identify the birds it sees, but it does a better job than smart feeders from other companies, and it does it at a lower price point (even with the $5 per month subscription, if you choose to get it). It‘s part bird feeder, part security camera, with a 1080p viewing angle and color night vision. This version comes with a solar panel—once it’s mounted and connected, you won’t have to recharge the feeder.\n\nThis smart bird feeder has a pretty unimpressive smartphone app. Its best features (2K video, AI identification) are locked behind a subscription that costs $4 per month or $48 per year. And the subscription isn’t really worth it—the AI was wonky, and the video clips are just 10 seconds long. However, the battery lasts forever thanks to the built-in solar panel—two months in our reviewer’s testing experience—and there’s a light for night viewing. If you simply want a bird feeder with a camera attached, or you want to see what all the fuss is about, this is a super-affordable option that can help you dip your toes into the world of smart bird feeders.\n\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one of our favorite Dyson vacuums overall. It’s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn’t a robot, this is a great deal on Dyson’s offering.\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nThis countertop appliance went viral on TikTok, and it’s one of the best pizza ovens we’ve tried. The 12-inch cooking surface can reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (which takes around 15 minutes). You’ll need to rotate your pizzas pretty frequently, and it can take a while to cook them since the top lets heat out so quickly. But it’s a good option for anyone looking to make homemade pizzas without needing to stick an appliance in their backyard.\n\nThis little table made our list of the best standing desks. It can be used as a nightside table or an over-bed desk, and it’s easy to move with the built-in wheels. Press the paddle underneath and adjust the height with ease. It’s nice to keep around if you tend to work from the couch or the back patio, and the 28- by 16-inch tabletop gives you just enough room to work without taking up too much space.\n\nThis affordable cat water fountain is our favorite budget-friendly option, and it’s even more affordable once you clip the on-page coupon. The metal bowl is dishwasher-safe, and there’s a clear viewing window so you can easily see the water level. The fountain can be adjusted between a few different configurations (waterfall and two bubble-up modes) so you can choose whichever your cat prefers. Replacement filters are cheap and the reservoir holds 2.4 liters.\n\nPhotograph: Breville\n\nThe Breville Barista Express is our favorite espresso machine for most people. It goes on sale for this price a few times per year. It’s easy to use thanks to the built-in grinder and adjustable steam wand. It doesn’t have a ton of extra features, but if you just want to make handcrafted espresso beverages at home, this’ll do the trick—and it lasts for years. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has owned his for six and counting.\n\nThe Basepaws Breed + Health DNA Test was great fun for me (and possibly less fun for my cat). After snagging a cheek swab and sending in the results, I was met with a ton of data about the stray I adopted years prior. She’s a mix of Maine coon and Ragdoll, with a smattering of many other breeds, and her health was good. (Technically all cats are polycats, but it’s still neat to see what kind of polycat my cat is). The test measures your cat’s DNA against over 100 feline health markers, including whether they’re at risk or at high risk of various disorders (like hypothyroidism or kidney disease). Of course this test shouldn’t replace veterinarian visits, but if you, too, took in a street cat, I think this test is worth it to prove they’re not a Martian.",

        "title": "Donald Trump Held Another Million-Dollar ‘Candlelight’ Dinner—With Elon Musk in Tow",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "An invitation to a “candlelight” dinner held this past Saturday at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club asked prospective guests to spend $1 million per seat. Trump attended the dinner along with Elon Musk, according to multiple photographs and videos of the event viewed by WIRED.\n\nElon Musk, wearing his standard uniform of a black sport coat over a black T-shirt, was seen shaking hands and waving to other attendees. He was with a woman wearing a floor length gown who appeared to be Shivon Zilis, according to Instagram Reels posted by multiple guests. Zilis, a Neuralink executive who previously sat on the board of OpenAI, is the mother of four of Musk’s 14 known children. (Zilis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nMusk, whose so-called Department of Government Efficiency has spent the last six weeks ransacking federal agencies, sat next to Trump at the dinner.\n\nWIRED previously reported on another candlelight dinner held on March 1 where guests were also invited to spend $1 million per person. That event appeared on the president’s public schedule with a note reading “the President attends the MAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.” The March 15 candlelight dinner did not appear on the official schedule.\n\n“You are invited to a candlelight dinner featuring special guest speaker President Donald J. Trump,” states the invitation, obtained by WIRED. “$1,000,000 per person.” The invitation has a “MAGA INC.” header and a note at the bottom of the invitation reads, “Donald J. Trump is appearing at this event only as a special guest speaker and is not asking for funds or donations.” MAGA Inc., or Make America Great Again Inc., is a super PAC that supported Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nWIRED has also reported that business leaders could secure a one-on-one meeting with Trump for $5 million at Mar-a-Lago. The $5 million meetings have become a “hot ticket” in the business community, a source familiar with them previously told WIRED.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the event or the lack of the event’s inclusion on the president’s official schedule.\n\nGot a Tip? Do you know anything about these dinners and meetings? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86 and zoeschiffer.87.\n\nExperts WIRED has spoken with about these candlelight dinners have noted concerns about their unusual nature. “I can’t recall a sitting president in the first weeks of his administration asking for millions of dollars in fundraising,” Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, previously told WIRED. “The concern is less about fundraising and more about access and influence. People hoping to get favorable treatment view it in their interest to donate money to Trump.”\n\nThe candlelight dinner occurred over the same weekend as the Palm Event, an annual celebration of motorsports in Palm Beach, Florida. One of the celebration’s weekend events occurred at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday afternoon and featured “street sportscars and cars with a motorsports heritage, one-of-a-kind, concept cars, celebrity-owned and cars with a racing history,” according to the Palm Event website. A number of these cars appeared the night prior at the candlelight dinner, according to Instagram reels that featured guests milling around a Rolls Royce, Bugatti, and Lamborghini, among other luxury vehicles displayed on the lawn.\n\nThe evening also coincided with a serious escalation in Trump’s crackdown on immigration. On Saturday, while Trump and Musk dined with MAGA donors, a federal judge ordered the White House to stop the deportation of people the Trump administration alleged were Venezuelan gang members. Despite that ruling, two planes carrying the alleged gang members flew from Texas to El Salvador. Senior officials reportedly told Axios that the ruling held no force “because the flights were over international waters.”",

        "content": "Indie game developer Vivid Foundry, like many other small studios, has been struggling to stay afloat. Its debut title, Solace State, did not make the commercial splash the team had hoped for when it launched in 2023. The studio has been barely making ends meet as of late and is searching for clients and freelance gigs to keep itself afloat. For Toronto-based director and producer Tanya Kan, a huge part of that effort is a visit to the annual Game Developers Conference held each March in San Francisco.\n\nOr it was, until Kan and her partner Gary Kings, a game trailer maker, canceled their trip on March 12, mere days before they planned to leave. Kan and Kings, like some other international developers, no longer felt safe traveling to the United States. “We came to the conclusion that the risk of something happening to us is still relatively low, but it’s too big to ignore, especially for a games conference,” Kings says.\n\nEvery year, several key gaming events take place in the US, including DICE, PAX West and PAX East, Summer Games Fest, and GDC; it was also the home of the now defunct E3. Although each event is different, they are often a place for developers to connect with peers, pitch platforms and publishers, work on professional development, and show off their work. In the days leading up to GDC, however, Trump’s comments about annexation and Canada as a “51st state,” as well as calling its border “an artificial line” drawn on a map; rising tensions amid tariff trade wars; and news reports of detainments at the American borders are increasingly making some developers nervous.\n\nOn LinkedIn, Hinterland founder Raphael van Lierop urged Canadian developers and colleagues to reconsider their GDC attendance. “You can no longer expect to travel to the US and return safely,” van Lierop posted. “Things are getting intense and they are going to get worse before they get better. Do not put yourself in a position where you are unable to get back into Canada, or where your Canadian citizenship is used against you.”\n\nVan Lierop’s post had been divisive among developers, drawing criticism from some who call it fear-mongering. Others, however, feel there are good reasons to be concerned about traveling to the United States. In the two months since his inauguration, President Donald Trump has rapidly changed US policies, leading to decreased safety around flights, passport confiscation at US borders, and mounting tensions between the US and Canada.\n\nEarlier this month, a Palestinian graduate student at Columbia University was arrested and detained for his involvement in pro-Palestine protests last year; the current administration now seeks to revoke the student’s green card and deport him. Van Lierop highlighted this concern in his post as well, for anyone who has “been supportive of any causes or expressed any values that run contrary to the tastes of the current administration in the US.”",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Knifings, firebombings, shootings, and murder-for-hire plots—all linked to a splinter group of the 764 crime network called “No Lives Matter.” According to its own manifesto, the group seeks to “purify mankind through endless attacks” and has released at least two “kill guides” tied to violent plots in the US and Europe. Intelligence documents reviewed by WIRED reveal growing concern among analysts, but experts remain unsure how to stop the group’s spread.\n\nOn Monday, X experienced intermittent outages after a botnet flooded the social network with junk traffic in an attempt to take down its system. Elon Musk stated that the distributed denial-of-service attack originated from Ukrainian IP addresses, implying that the country—already under siege by a Russian invasion and frequently mocked by the centibillionaire—may have been responsible. Security experts tell WIRED that this is not how DDoS attacks work.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, mass layoffs are hurting US cyberdefense, weakening protections against foreign adversaries. Vital staff cuts have left employees overworked and strained international partnerships, according to interviews with staff at the agency that helps safeguard cities, businesses, and nonprofits from cyberattacks. “A lot of people are scared,” says one employee. “We’re waiting for that other shoe to drop. We don't know what's coming.” As WIRED takes you inside the agencies at the center of the uncertainty and chaos of the second Trump administration, we've updated our quick and easy guide to using Signal to help you get the most out of the messaging app’s end-to-end encryption.\n\nThat’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nThose “green bubbles,” the cross-platform text messages that annoy iPhone owners and keep Android users relegated to a group-chat underclass, aren’t just a cultural disconnect. They’re also a security issue: Text messages sent between Android and iOS devices—unlike blue-bubble iMessage texts or Android-to-Android messages—aren’t end-to-end encrypted, leaving them open to surveillance or interception. Now, that may finally be changing.\n\nThe GSM Association, responsible for many widely used telecom standards, this week announced that its Rich Communication Services (or RCS) protocol will now support end-to-end encryption for cross-platform texting, and Apple revealed that it will now integrate that feature of RCS into its iOS devices. Until now, Apple and Google had both supported RCS’s other features in texts sent between iOS and Android, but not end-to-end encryption, which ensures that only the devices sending and receiving messages can decrypt them and not any server or snoop that sees them in transit.\n\nNeither Apple nor the GSMA has said exactly when the new privacy features are launching. Until then, anyone sending cross-platform messages would be wise to stick with apps like WhatsApp or Signal that have long provided end-to-end encryption—and have also helped Android and iPhone users avoid personal disputes over bubble colors.\n\nThe White House has tapped Sean Plankey to run CISA, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security primarily responsible for American digital defense. Plankey, long considered the leading contender for the role, served in multiple cybersecurity positions in the first Trump administration and previously held senior roles in US Cyber Command. In that DOD agency focused on cyber offense, he served as a weapons and tactics branch chief and earned a Bronze Star for hacking operations in Afghanistan. CISA, like many federal agencies, has faced hundreds of personnel cuts in recent weeks, and its previous director, Chris Krebs, came under harsh criticism under the previous Trump administration for the agency’s work to counter disinformation and secure elections. Krebs was fired in a Trump tweet near the end of his term after CISA described the 2020 election, whose results Trump baselessly contested, as the “most secure in American history.”\n\nNot even the National Security Agency has been spared from Elon Musk’s scorched-earth campaign to gut the federal government. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had visited the intelligence agency in Fort Meade, meeting with leadership to discuss staff reductions and operational changes, according to current and former US officials who spoke to the Journal.\n\nDespite being one of the most insulated branches of US intelligence, the NSA has still found itself pulled into Musk’s orbit. The visit to Fort Meade is another sign of the sweeping nature of his influence and the extraordinary access the world’s richest man has been granted over even the most secretive federal operations.",

        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Most people shouldn’t spend more than $100 on a gaming mouse. It’s just not worth it. But you’re not most people, are you? I'm not sure what part of the name intrigued you, but the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro 4K Wireless is for gamers among us who strive to not only have some fun on the weekends but also to win matches. It's got “Pro” in the name after all.\n\nHyperX’s latest gaming mouse is a nice option for highly competitive PC gamers, and at its $120 price it’s a great alternative to pricier esports mice from competitors like Logitech or Razer.\n\nThe Top Tier\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nThe Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro fits into the high end of the gaming mouse category. It's a $30 upgrade over the standard HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 that arrived in 2024. Both are esports wireless gaming mice and are some of the lighter and more full-featured options on the market, with a super-responsive feel. You get a top-of-the-line sensor and upgraded switches on both.\n\nThe only visual change between this and the standard Pulsefire Haste 2 is the color. Unfortunately, I found the Slate Gray pretty dull, and it's the only option right now. I would have liked to see a white or black as a variant, at least to match what you can get with the cheaper model. If you didn’t know better, you might assume this mouse is more bare-bones than high-end. I prefer the look of both the Razer Viper V3 Pro and Logitech Pro X Superlight 2, its two main competitors. The Logitech mouse has a unique shape with more color options that make it stand out.\n\nHyperX's mouse does have the slightest splash of RGB though, right on the scroll wheel, adding a touch of interest to what is otherwise a very standard-looking peripheral. Minimal lighting is not abnormal for these high-end esports mice, which tend to favor performance over bling.",

        "title": "Democrats Demand Answers on DOGE's Use of AI",
        "source": "https://www.wired.com/",
        "content": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee fired off two dozen requests Wednesday morning pressing federal agency leaders for information about plans to install AI software throughout federal agencies amid the ongoing cuts to the government's workforce.\n\nThe barrage of inquiries follow recent reporting by WIRED and The Washington Post concerning efforts by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to automate tasks with a variety of proprietary AI tools and access sensitive data.\n\n“The American people entrust the federal government with sensitive personal information related to their health, finances, and other biographical information on the basis that this information will not be disclosed or improperly used without their consent,” the requests read, “including through the use of an unapproved and unaccountable third-party AI software.”\n\nThe requests, first obtained by WIRED, are signed by Gerald Connolly, a Democratic congressman from Virginia.\n\nThe central purpose of the requests is to press the agencies into demonstrating that any potential use of AI is legal and that steps are being taken to safeguard Americans’ private data. The Democrats also want to know whether any use of AI will financially benefit Musk, who founded xAI and whose troubled electric car company, Tesla, is working to pivot toward robotics and AI. The Democrats are further concerned, Connolly says, that Musk could be using his access to sensitive government data for personal enrichment, leveraging the data to “supercharge” his own proprietary AI model, known as Grok.\n\nIn the requests, Connolly notes that federal agencies are “bound by multiple statutory requirements in their use of AI software,” pointing chiefly to the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, which works to standardize the government’s approach to cloud services and ensure AI-based tools are properly assessed for security risks. He also points to the Advancing American AI Act, which requires federal agencies to “prepare and maintain an inventory of the artificial intelligence use cases of the agency,” as well as “make agency inventories available to the public.”\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at dell.3030.\n\nDocuments obtained by WIRED last week show that DOGE operatives have deployed a proprietary chatbot called GSAi to approximately 1,500 federal workers. The GSA oversees federal government properties and supplies information technology services to many agencies.\n\nA memo obtained by WIRED reporters shows employees have been warned against feeding the software any controlled unclassified information. Other agencies, including the departments of Treasury and Health and Human Services, have considered using a chatbot, though not necessarily GSAi, according to documents viewed by WIRED.\n\nWIRED has also reported that the United States Army is currently using software dubbed CamoGPT to scan its records systems for any references to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. An Army spokesperson confirmed the existence of the tool but declined to provide further information about how the Army plans to use it.\n\nIn the requests, Connolly writes that the Department of Education possesses personally identifiable information on more than 43 million people tied to federal student aid programs. “Due to the opaque and frenetic pace at which DOGE seems to be operating,” he writes, “I am deeply concerned that students’, parents’, spouses’, family members’ and all other borrowers’ sensitive information is being handled by secretive members of the DOGE team for unclear purposes and with no safeguards to prevent disclosure or improper, unethical use.” The Washington Post previously reported that DOGE had begun feeding sensitive federal data drawn from record systems at the Department of Education to analyze its spending.\n\nEducation secretary Linda McMahon said Tuesday that she was proceeding with plans to fire more than a thousand workers at the department, joining hundreds of others who accepted DOGE “buyouts” last month. The Education Department has lost nearly half of its workforce—the first step, McMahon says, in fully abolishing the agency.\n\n“The use of AI to evaluate sensitive data is fraught with serious hazards beyond improper disclosure,” Connolly writes, warning that “inputs used and the parameters selected for analysis may be flawed, errors may be introduced through the design of the AI software, and staff may misinterpret AI recommendations, among other concerns.”\n\nHe adds: “Without clear purpose behind the use of AI, guardrails to ensure appropriate handling of data, and adequate oversight and transparency, the application of AI is dangerous and potentially violates federal law.”",

        "content": "On a chilly morning last October, my 8-year-old daughter and I took our new e-bike, which she had named Toby, on its maiden voyage to school. We admired trees exploding in vibrant golds and flocks of geese soaring above. To amuse ourselves, we’d brought along a life-size Halloween skeleton, which sat in the back with my daughter, arms outstretched in a friendly wave. Along the way, people honked, smiled, and stopped to chat. I felt connected to our neighborhood in a way I hadn’t ever experienced.\n\nBefore Toby, mornings spent driving my daughter to school were monotonous and filled with traffic. Since the purchase, our commutes have become daily highlights. My daughter and I bond with each other and our community, and we get to appreciate the time outdoors, all while saving on car maintenance and mitigating our carbon footprint. But the e-bike has changed our life in many other ways too—some of them unexpectedly profound.\n\nOur family’s motivation to get an e-bike started with climate concerns. Kids learn by example, and my husband and I often wondered if we were setting the right one by driving two gas-guzzling cars. But the alternatives were limited. We couldn’t afford to purchase an electric vehicle. Electric scooters were out of the question—they’re meant to transport only one person and can be dangerous for children. I tried biking to school once, my daughter behind me in a trailer. Many miles later, I showed up drenched in sweat—great as a workout, but impractical for day-to-day.\n\nRead: How school drop-off became a nightmare\n\nSo when our city introduced subsidies on e-bikes, we decided to give one a try. They’re fairly safe, cheaper than cars, and gentle on the environment. Plus, one study shows that they make for some of the happiest commuters. We chose one in a zippy sky blue, with two padded bench seats, metal safety bars, and oversize storage bags on either side. It’s cheerful and somehow charismatic, befitting its sweet name.\n\nFrom our first trip that October day, it was clear how much easier and more pleasant getting around on Toby would be than driving in a car. We avoided the worst of the car traffic and all the huffing and puffing of cycling. E-bikes are still great exercise—riders burn only about 15 to 30 percent fewer calories on them than people on typical bikes do—but you probably won’t get sweaty enough to need a shower. I also felt good knowing that riding Toby enabled us to act more in line with our environmental values. Research from the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on energy, has found that if all drivers in the 10 most populous American cities switched from cars to e-bikes for trips shorter than five miles—a category that makes up more than 60 percent of all car trips in the United States—the emissions reductions would be “equivalent to avoiding the use of four natural gas plants over the course of a year.”\n\nAnd the costs were affordable for our family. Our e-bike was $1,200 after the subsidy, requires an annual $200 tune-up, and accrues negligible electricity costs. They’re a bit pricier without the subsidies—good ones go for about $2,000—but savings on gas could add up fast.\n\nMore than the practicality, I’ve appreciated how much easier Toby has made it to connect with my daughter. Sitting directly behind me, she’s more involved in our journey than when she’s in the back seat of a car, so opportunities for learning come naturally. I alert her to upcoming bumps, narrate various turns and stops, and ask her to double-check for cars coming up behind us. We’ve discussed the satisfaction of using our bodies to get somewhere rather than letting the throttle do all the work. Toby can go up to 25 miles per hour, so I’ve explained the importance of slowing down for pedestrians.\n\nBeing out in the open air also gives us a chance to stop and say hello to people we recognize and to meet our neighbors, which we rarely did before. “We don’t belong in silo’d cars driving around our neighborhoods,” Arleigh Greenwald, a bike mechanic and the creator of the online community resource Cargo Bike Life, told me in an email. Whereas cars shut us off from other people, bikes open up opportunities to bond. Riding them is a step toward “creating a connected community,” Greenwald wrote.\n\nRead: The real reason you should get an e-bike\n\nOf course, e-bikes aren’t for everyone. Families in high-level apartments without elevators would struggle to lug them upstairs. Parking them outside takes some forethought and a good lock. Most batteries last for only about 15 to 60 miles, so the bikes are best for shorter travel. They won’t help much with moving either. Toby can handle Costco runs for our family of three, but probably not for a big family.\n\nFor those who do use an e-bike, getting around can be tricky. Cities weren’t built for e-bikes, and Greenwald pointed out that some roads aren’t safe for them. She recommended testing routes on your own before you bring your kids, asking local bike shops about safe options, and accepting when you’ll have to go with another mode of transport. “If I’m replacing as many car trips with safe e-bike trips as possible,” Greenwald told me, “I’m doing great!” In our rides, my daughter and I have encountered plenty of these infrastructural hurdles. Some routes don’t have bike lanes or have lanes that end at random spots; others expect us to go up stairs. When this happens, my daughter and I chat about why, and then we contact our local representatives together to request improvements—an important lesson in civic engagement.\n\nBut once we found our best route to school, these obstacles faded. It takes five extra minutes each way, but that time is spent along a river trail where we’ve spotted herons, kingfishers, and kestrels. Our time outside has otherwise decreased as my daughter has gotten older, so this tether to the outdoors has been a gift. Being in nature can help kids manage stress, grow more self-confident, and maintain their mental health, Pooja Tandon, a pediatrician and researcher at Seattle Children’s Research Institute, told me in an email. I see this in my daughter, who seems cheerful and refreshed most mornings, not half-awake like she used to be.\n\nNo matter how well her day starts, school can still be an interpersonal minefield. When I picked my daughter up in the car, she dealt with the residual stress by communicating through grunts. Now, perhaps energized by our rides, she tells funny or embarrassing tales, and updates me on the second-grade gossip. I’ve found that challenging conversations are easier on Toby too. When our cat recently passed away, my daughter waited until our commute to ask hard questions about death. Surrounded by nature and without the pressure of direct eye contact, I was able to think calmly about how to answer her in honest, age-appropriate ways.\n\nIt’s been about five months since Toby’s first journey, and we’ve ridden nearly 1,000 miles. These days, e-biking feels easier than driving, even in situations you might not expect. We recently biked home after school as dark clouds rolled in over the Rockies and the first snowflakes of a late-winter storm feathered the sky. At a red light, we heard my daughter’s name and saw her classmate’s family in an SUV next to us; they seemed shocked that we were biking in the cold.\n\nI might have felt that way once too. But we were dressed warmly, and we didn’t want to give up our ride along the river path. That day, we watched waterfowl tuck into the river shallows for the evening and stopped to tell a neighbor with a new baby that we’d shovel their driveway in the morning. I worried that my daughter might have felt embarrassed about the stoplight encounter, but as we unbuckled our helmets in our driveway, she said she bet her friend had been wishing he was on an e-bike too. She clearly understood what I’d come to learn about e-bikes: Yes, our commutes were slightly slower and a little chillier than they once had been, but they were also so much richer.",

The secret of life is: Keep your eye on the ball.\n\nI’m borrowing that from a 1998 song by America’s sweetheart, Faith Hill, but if you don’t know the song, you still know that simple truth. You also know that to fail is to strike out; to fail valiantly is to go down swinging; to be surprised is to be thrown a curveball; to help a buddy out is to go to bat for him; and to succeed brilliantly is to knock one out of the park. And even if you haven’t seen A League of Their Own, or have somehow missed Jennifer Garner’s Capital One ads, you’ve probably heard the maxim “There’s no crying in baseball.”\n\nExplore the April 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nIn January, I was standing in the locker room of George M. Steinbrenner Field, in Tampa, next to my teammates, whom I had met only the night before. When we heard the immortal words of Tom Hanks as Jimmy Dugan, the aggrieved manager of the Rockford Peaches women’s baseball team, piping out of a nearby speaker, we recognized them and laughed. Then we clapped (or took out our phones for photos) as Len Milcowitz, the field coordinator and unofficial emcee of the weekend, emerged wearing a full Peaches uniform to drive home the point. He’d worn it in our honor, he said. “You represent the true spirit of baseball in this country, period,” he told us.\n\nBy that he meant that we were here only for the love of the game. As women, it was true, we could have no other motive, such as being signed by a team or even reliving high-school glory days. In fact, we had paid about $2,500 for the privilege. There were 87 of us, divided into six teams. This was the first full day of the 2025 Women’s Mini-Fantasy Camp, an annual event advertised with retro panache: “Ladies, opportunity is finally knocking and your chance to experience life as a New York Yankee is here.”\n\nThough many Major League Baseball teams host fantasy camps for men, only the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox have offered them for women. This year’s camp was more immersive than usual. On top of receiving full uniforms (to keep!) and access to ice baths and physical therapists and real Yankees catering (memorably good pot roast), we were technically playing in a major-league stadium: The Tampa Bay Rays will be using the Yankees’ spring-training facility this year for their home games because Hurricane Milton took the roof off Tropicana Field.\n\nRead: Climate change comes for baseball\n\nOver the course of two days we would play 35 innings of baseball—five games of seven innings apiece, coached by former Yankees, whom camp employees referred to by the official title of “Legends.” I had several good reasons to be nervous. A friend had encouraged me to read George Plimpton’s 1961 book, Out of My League, which is about him pitching to major-league players at an All-Star exhibition game for a story in Sports Illustrated. I did read it, and that’s how I learned that Plimpton had been “a fanatic about pitching” while in school. I, in contrast, had never played baseball at all, despite being completely obsessed with watching it (at the stadium, on TV, on my phone while at work or at weddings). And I had not trained as much as I’d meant to in the weeks leading up to the camp—I’d gone to the batting cages a few times, played catch with my dad, and done several squats, but it was winter and it got dark at 4 p.m. It had been hard to work baseball into my days.\n\nThe other problem was that I don’t like the New York Yankees. When I signed up for the camp, I hadn’t thought this would be much of an issue. But then my favorite team, the New York Mets, signed the Yankees’ superstar Juan Soto out from under them, and my situation became politically sticky. When I tested a reveal of my Mets fandom to a friendly seeming woman on the shuttle bus to the opening dinner, she shushed me sharply, and for my own good.\n\nSo I kept quiet. And in this way, it was easy to get along with my assigned teammates, and it was easy to have a good time, even though our team name was the Pinstripes, which really rubbed the Yankees of it all right in a girl’s face. Our roster ranged in age from 24 to 70, and in experience from Division I softball to, well, me. Two women who’d gone to school together in New Jersey were there celebrating their 60th birthdays—Nina Kaplan, a Boca Raton mother of four who had never played baseball before, and Elizabeth Osder, who goes by Bitsy, a Los Angeles media executive who holds a place in baseball history. On April 21, 1974, she appeared on the front page of the New York Daily News when she became one of the first girls legally permitted to join a Little League baseball team, in New Jersey.\n\nPlayers stretch before a game. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nEveryone was there for fun, and so was I, but I was also there because I wanted to briefly see a real-life staging of something that is still mostly a dream and that most people associate only with a 30-year-old Hollywood movie. There’s no crying in baseball, and there are no women in baseball either.\n\nSure, girls can play on Little League baseball teams, as Bitsy did, with boys. They can play on high-school baseball teams with boys. A scant few of them have even played on college baseball teams with boys. But they don’t get their own teams. There is no such thing as high-school or college baseball for women. There is no such thing as professional baseball for women, apart from a World Cup team that is assembled and disassembled every few years. Not only is this the baffling reality; it’s a baffling reality that hardly anybody talks about.\n\nFrom the September 2016 issue: Breaking into baseball’s ultimate boys’ club\n\nAfter the World Series ended in October, with nothing to look forward to but the long and empty months before the next baseball season, I settled in to watch Ken Burns’s 1994 documentary, Baseball, which is broken up into nine episodes. “There are only three things that America will be known for 2,000 years from now when they study this civilization,” the writer Gerald Early says in the first one. “The Constitution, jazz music, and baseball. They’re the three most beautifully designed things this culture has ever produced.” Well, women aren’t constrained in their enjoyment of jazz, or of the Constitution (for now), but …\n\nOver the nights that I spent being thoroughly entertained by the documentary, I nevertheless felt a pit in my stomach that got deeper and deeper. Burns very explicitly articulates the sport as being foundational to our culture and reflective of our society’s ideals. The game is democratic because it’s fair, egalitarian because it’s simple, and perfectly designed because its creators—energetic, imaginative people—arrived at the measurements for the diamond as if through divine inspiration. Baseball rewards commitment and reveals character; it loves rule-benders but judges cheaters. It has lofty goals and serious expectations, but it allows for theatricality and fun. It glorifies teamwork (double plays, rallies, sacrifices, and even sign-stealing are collaborative) but also reveres the hero (when a man comes up to bat, he comes up alone). It provides a convenient excuse to eat a hot dog.\n\nWomen play basketball, which is almost as old as baseball but has never carried the same level of cultural significance, and they play soccer, which is not predominantly an American game. They play hockey and lacrosse. They don’t play the vulgar, stupid sport of football, but nobody should. Yet they play basically everything else—every sport ever invented, even the weird ones. For no obvious or practical or logical reason, they are allowed to love, but almost never to play, baseball. They don’t get to play America’s game.\n\nActually, contrary to some of my sweeping statements, in baseball’s earliest days, women were eager to play and sometimes allowed to do so. Several women’s colleges had baseball teams in the mid-to-late 1800s—by 1875, Vassar had a number of them, including the Sure-Pops and the Daisy-Clippers. The all-Black, all-women Dolly Vardens barnstormed in the 1880s as some of the first documented professional women baseball players; their history, largely forgotten, has been revived by the historian Leslie Heaphy, a co-editor of 2006’s Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball (which she is updating).\n\nBut doctors were convinced, or so they said, that physical activity could render women infertile or even kill them. In 1867, a nationally syndicated newspaper story blamed baseball-playing for a young woman’s death from typhoid. One of the best-known baseball players in the country at the time, John Montgomery Ward, then of the New York Giants, wrote in his 1888 book, Base-Ball: How to Become a Player, “Base-ball in its mildest form is essentially a robust game, and it would require an elastic imagination to conceive of little girls possessed of physical powers such as its play demands.” When the game became big business at the turn of the 20th century, women were welcomed at the ballpark as spectators. Their presence was thought to help civilize the environs and increase the likelihood of entire families becoming fans and spending money on the sport. But that welcome didn’t extend to the diamond.\n\nFrom the May 1928 issue: Women aren’t fans\n\nA few months ago, I had a long call with the historian Jennifer Ring, the author of the 2009 book Stolen Bases: Why American Girls Don’t Play Baseball. We talked about her work for a while, and then we talked about how much we love baseball. For many years, she said, she’d felt alienated from the game and angry that her daughter, who was an excellent player, had run out of options and was forced to abandon the sport. “There was probably a decade of my life where I was just too pissed off to even watch baseball,” she said. But Ring grew up a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and she’d recently been roped back in by their World Series run and by the otherworldly superstar Shohei Ohtani. “I watched again this year, and it’s still the game I love,” she told me. “It’s brilliant. And the best players are just thrilling to watch.”\n\nOf course, hardly anyone resembles Ohtani, even in Major League Baseball. Mookie Betts, another Dodger great, is nothing like him. He’s seven inches shorter and at least 30 pounds lighter, and plays multiple defensive positions with charisma and flair. Ohtani, one of the best hitters and pitchers to have ever lived, is faintly aloof and carries himself woodenly (and has a fantastic head of hair). “It’s the people’s game because it calls for a variety of different kinds of body types and skills,” Ring pointed out. There are smaller and faster men in the middle infield; bigger guys at the corners; pitchers who look like Gumby dolls and pitchers who look like they belong to the Teamsters. All of this diversity gives the lie to the suggestion that women physically cannot play.\n\nBut this is a storied idea that has been repeated across generations. In the mid-1920s, the all-female Philadelphia Bobbies were completing a barnstorming tour of Japan, where they surprised journalists, impressed fans, and received celebrity treatment. Back home, girls were being encouraged to play a version of baseball, with a larger ball and a smaller field, that would be more suitable for them—a game variously known as kitten ball, playground ball, diamond ball, and mush ball, and originally invented in the winter months to be played by men, indoors. The game is now called softball. The details were laid out by Gladys E. Palmer in Baseball for Girls and Women, published in 1929. Palmer was an early advocate for girls’ athletics, but her attitudes were still of their time. She offered advice on how to throw properly (girls “do not have a natural aptitude for throwing, which all boys have from early childhood”) and discouraged girls and women from sliding. As Palmer acknowledged, the version of the game she promoted was meant to be “less strenuous.”\n\nMembers of the Rockford Peaches, 1944. The team was part of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, created by the Chicago Cubs owner and chewing-gum mogul Philip K. Wrigley. (Bettmann / Getty)\n\nThat word, strenuous, comes up often. It was used by A. G. Spalding, an early baseball executive who also founded the country’s first sporting-goods empire, when he said that a woman was free to wave her handkerchief and root for the home team, but that “neither our wives, our sisters, our daughters, nor our sweethearts, may play Base Ball on the field … Base Ball is too strenuous for womankind.” The same word was used against the 17-year-old pitching phenom Jackie Mitchell, who was signed by the Minor League Chattanooga Lookouts (and who struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in a 1931 exhibition game). The baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, reportedly voided Mitchell’s contract, explaining that the baseball life was “too strenuous” for women.\n\nOne of my great loyalties, odd though it is for even me to contemplate, is to Brett Baty, a 25-year-old from Texas who was a first-round draft pick for the Mets in 2019 and was supposed to be their third baseman of the future. We have essentially nothing in common, obviously.\n\nBut something about his story has grabbed me. Baty hit a home run in his first major-league at-bat, in front of his family and against a hated division rival, but he’s never been able to string enough of those moments together. He has flashes of brilliance, and then he gets rattled by something. He starts making mistakes and looking bewildered. He loses his head. Then he goes down to the minors and plays with such dignity and grace. He wears the ugly promotional jerseys they make you wear at that level, and he hits some more home runs and learns a new defensive position in case that will help his chances of being called back up. Last year, his best friend, Mark Vientos, ended up taking the job that was supposed to be his and has excelled at it. In the playoffs, during which Vientos broke the Mets’ record for postseason runs batted in, the camera cut to Baty, watching from the dugout, whenever his friend did something great, and he was always, with no hesitation, ecstatic.\n\nThen, in the offseason, another insult and injury: His jersey number, 22, just happened to be the one that the superstar Juan Soto wanted, and the Mets reportedly had promised it to him in his $765 million contract. Soto may have gone through the ceremony of offering Baty a fancy present, such as a watch or a car, in exchange for the number, as players typically do in these situations, but it wasn’t immediately clear that he had. I took exception to this even though hardly anybody else—just a few other fans on social media—seemed to care. Are we not owed dignity even when we’re kind of a flop?\n\nThat’s a long way of explaining how my career as third baseman (baseperson?) for the Pinstripes began and ended. Though I had no experience, I reasoned that I was young and fairly coordinated, and I wanted to try my hand at the hot corner.\n\nOur first game was on one of the Yankees’ many practice fields, against another fantasy-camp team, the Bombers. When I walked out in my uniform, I felt like a ballplayer. I thought I’d watched enough of the game on television—almost every night for half of the year—to know what to do, at least basically. I quickly handled the first ball that a Bomber hit down the line to me, and I stood up with plenty of time to throw the runner out. But when I heaved the ball across the infield, it fell far short of the first baseman and way off line. The same thing happened with the next ball that came to me. And the next. My team was down by two runs at the end of the first inning.\n\nThen came my time to bat, which was my true fear. I had to be called back and reminded to put on a batting helmet. I panicked and momentarily forgot which side of the plate I was supposed to stand on. It came to me just in time, but I struck out on three pitches. Our coaches were throwing to us, and they were not trying to strike us out. They were “trying to hit your bats,” as they put it.\n\nThe author at bat, George M. Steinbrenner Field (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nAfter this, I sat in the dugout and watched the other women watch the Yankees shortstop, Anthony Volpe, who was working out on a field behind us. (“He wasn’t very friendly,” one of them complained mildly, after admitting that she had more or less been catcalling him.) I moved to center field after a few more wild throws, and Kaley Sullivan, a 30-year-old police officer from California, took over third base. One ball slipped past her, and I scooped it up and threw it back to her; she stepped on the base and made the out. This was a highlight of my life, but in my next at-bat, I managed only two foul tips before striking out again. We lost the game 9–4 and mollified ourselves by saying we would work out the kinks in the afternoon.\n\nAt lunch, I sat next to Leslie Konsig, a 42-year-old insurance representative and plainly the best athlete on our team, who had been making plays at shortstop as reliably as I had seen the guys do it on TV. It was difficult to look anywhere other than at her on the field. She wore her dark hair in a single braid, smiled easily at everyone, and moved with the ease that comes with total competence. She treated us all like real ballplayers—meaning she was a bit more specific and direct at times than our actual coaches.\n\nLeslie was there with her friend Lainey Archenault, 43, an animated woman with a strong Jersey accent. They are both moms, and they play together on a New Jersey softball team called the Sluggers; Lainey conspired with Leslie’s wife to sign her up for the camp as a surprise. Lainey, I learned, is a die-hard Yankees fan who has been watching almost every single game for as long as she can remember. She clocked immediately that I’d chosen the jersey number 0 in reference to the somewhat random relief pitcher Adam Ottavino, who grew up in Brooklyn near where I live and who played for the Yankees in 2019 and 2020. (More recently, he played for the Mets.) Though she has coached her son’s 10-and-under travel baseball team, this was the first time she’d played a game of baseball instead of softball. Growing up, she told me, she’d been obsessed with Don Mattingly—she was left-handed, as he is, so she’d hoped to be a first baseman, as he was. But she’s petite, so that wasn’t in the cards. Instead, she was put in the outfield, which she now prefers, because you get to watch a whole game unfold in front of you.\n\nBy contrast, Leslie didn’t care much about the Yankees. She was wearing the number 22 and had no idea that it was a sore spot for Yankees fans who were mourning Soto’s betrayal. “I’m more here to play,” she told me. “To feel, like, what it is to be on the field, wear these uniforms, use the amenities.” She’d been the only girl on her Little League team, and she’d played until high school, when she had to switch to softball. But Leslie still had a Yankees-fan story: She’d gone to the 1996 World Series with her dad and his friends, and they were so overcome by giddiness that they’d even included her, at age 14, in the celebratory cigars.\n\nThis set off some table-wide chatter about the most recent World Series, which the Yankees lost to the Dodgers in somewhat humiliating fashion, capped off by a disastrous error-riddled inning that saw a five-run lead evaporate in the decisive Game 5. “We played better than they did, today,” Bitsy Osder said.\n\nHigh on camaraderie, I went into the afternoon games confident that I could improve my performance. For the second game, we were on the main field—an intimidating change of venue, as this meant music blaring over the loudspeakers while we warmed up, use of the giant scoreboard, and an announcer to read off our names as we went up to bat.\n\nWe were quickly down by three, but my teammates rallied for five runs in the fourth inning, and we ended up winning 7–3. The rally was exhilarating—I was Brett Baty in the dugout. Again, I contributed no hits. I had been dropped to the bottom of the batting order. But I pinch-ran for a teammate and accepted my status as role player. This time, at least, I hit a grounder and was thrown out, rather than just flailing at the plate.\n\nBefore our third and final game of the day, back on the practice fields, we got a pep talk. One of our coaches, or Legends, was Ray Burris, a journeyman pitcher who played with the Yankees in 1979. (At dinner, he let us each hold the American League Championship ring he’d been awarded in 2012 as a pitching coach in the Detroit Tigers organization.) He sat us down and said: “You’re as good as your last game, and you’re as bad as your first game.” We were not to get big heads.\n\nIn the third game, we scored four in the top of the first, but the other team, the Captains, scored five in the bottom. I misplayed a ball in the outfield and then stepped on it, shooting it into foul territory, where it skidded away across the dirt. I made a base-running error (as a pinch runner) and I twisted myself up underneath a fly ball and felt my back wrench as it dropped behind me.\n\nThen Leslie hit an inside-the-park home run—assisted by two, or possibly four, defensive errors by the other team—and we went wild. But the Captains rallied again in the bottom of the sixth for another five runs and then we were down again, 10–6. My teammates worked a gritty top of the seventh, in our final chance to score. They brought in two runs, making it 10–8. I stared at the lineup card in horror as what was about to happen came together in my mind: I was going to be the last woman up. Two outs, bases loaded. If I hit the ball, we could tie the game—or even win, if there were two, or possibly four, defensive errors.\n\nI swung at the first pitch and missed. I let the second pitch go by—ball. I swung and missed at a third pitch. I could feel humiliation a breath away. Then I nicked a foul ball. I could hardly believe the moment was still happening. Then, on the next pitch, I heard what was not quite a crack but was still the perfect sound of bat on ball. We were playing with wooden bats, not the metal ones they have at batting cages, which sound tinny and awful and jangle your hands. I ran in a dead sprint, made it to first base, and didn’t see the ball anywhere. I was safe!\n\nBut then I turned around and saw that the pitcher had fielded the ball, which had been nothing more than an infield roller, and had thrown it to the catcher for the force play at home.\n\nI’d made the last out and the game was over.\n\nIn the early ’70s, several Major League teams hosted Hot Pants Days, which offered free admission to women who came to the stadium wearing short-shorts. Also at that time, Little League teams that allowed girls to play could be threatened with revocation of their charters.\n\nMaria Pepe grew up in an apartment complex in Hoboken, New Jersey, that was full of children, mostly boys. Whenever she was done with her homework, she would join them in playing slap ball, stickball, Wiffle ball, and any other variation of baseball they could make work. “From a young age, maybe 7 years old, I just started playing, and I loved it,” she told me. In 1972, she tried out for Little League and made the Young Democrats team. She pitched three games before angry parents reported her team to Little League’s national office; the league threatened to take away the charter that covered all Hoboken teams, so Pepe’s coach came over to her house and took back her uniform. He let her keep her cap.\n\nThe National Organization for Women picked up her case in the spring of 1972, filing a complaint with the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights. This caused a big to-do, and newspapers and radio followed the case closely, though Pepe’s parents helped her tune a lot of it out. She did vaguely know that a court was hearing arguments regarding the density of her bones as compared with boys’ bones, presented by Creighton J. Hale, Little League’s executive vice president and director of research. (This argument was based on a Japanese study of cadavers and another about skiing accidents, both of which included only adult bones.) Hale also presented a hypothesis that being hit by a ball could cause breast cancer in girls. Little League’s other arguments were impressively circular. One was that there was no sense in allowing girls to play baseball, because they would not have future opportunities to play it professionally. Another was that the Little League national charter, which specified its purpose as developing “qualities of citizenship, sportsmanship, and manhood,” would be contradicted by the inclusion of girls.\n\nNina Kaplan, a Boca Raton mother of four who had never played baseball before, hustles to first. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nJudge Sylvia Pressler found these arguments uncompelling. “Little League is as American as hot dogs and apple pie,” she wrote in her ruling. There was no good reason why “that piece of public Americana should be withheld from girls.” Little League did not acquiesce easily. The organization filed an appeal, which it lost. But by this time, Pepe was too old to play.\n\nMy teammate Bitsy said that Pepe “took the arrows” for her. Bitsy was one of the first sign-ups, and so news of her first game for the Englewood Orioles was printed in papers across the country. She struck out in her first at-bat, but then drew a walk and scored a run. She was described by the Daily News as “all mouth,” challenging the umpires and instructing her teammates on what to do. She jokes that she thinks her fly was open in one of the newspaper photos.\n\nNow easing into retirement, Bitsy plays in two L.A. leagues just for fun. Like many young kids, she fantasized about playing for the New York Yankees. “By the grace of Maria Pepe and the New Jersey Supreme Court,” she told me, “I was able to sustain that fantasy a little longer.” She considers her Little League experience a blessing. She was accepted by her teammates and she had a blast. “I am a very positive, glass-half-full person,” she told me. “I just think my whole outlook in life would have been different if they had said no to me.”\n\nFor the past 50 years, Little League hasn’t said no to girls who love baseball, but it has set them up to be a minority. Instead of encouraging girls to play baseball after the court decision, Little League encouraged softball for girls and made that their primary option. This example was followed by high schools and colleges, which offer only softball teams for girls and young women. And even if you’re good enough to play with the boys in high school, how do you stick it out, knowing that you could get a college scholarship for softball if you switched?\n\n“Anybody who knows the two games knows they are not equivalent,” Leslie Heaphy, the historian, told me. Softball has a bigger ball and underhand pitching, as well as a smaller diamond, a closer fence, and a different style of play that is both faster and simpler. Both are great games, but our culture has accepted a false equivalency, she argued. It’s “just a way of never having to address the issue that women want to play baseball [and] should be allowed to. It should be open to anybody.”\n\nJennifer Ring pointed out that the number of girls playing on boys’ high-school baseball teams hasn’t changed for decades—it hovers between 1,000 and 2,000 out of a total of nearly half a million. In recent years, Little League has held events to honor “Girls With Game,” as they call girls who play baseball or softball. But when I wrote to ask how many girls currently play baseball in Little League International, Kevin Fountain, the organization’s senior director of communications, wrote back to say that the information wasn’t available. He could only say that 32 percent of Little League participants—across baseball and softball—are female.\n\nThinking it might be a matter of a statistic being difficult to calculate for some reason, I wrote back and asked for a couple of alternatives. Could he tell me how many baseball teams have girls on them? Could he tell me whether any Little League baseball teams are girls-only? He could not.\n\nIn an earlier email, he’d sent me a link to an article about the Maria Pepe Little League Baseball Legacy Series, which was played for the first time in 2024, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. I noticed that the visiting girls stayed in dorms in the Dr. Creighton J. Hale International Grove—a complex named for the man who’d once argued that they would ruin the sport if they ever picked up a bat. He eventually regretted this position, and when he met Pepe later in life, he told her that his granddaughter had begun playing ball.\n\nThroughout the weekend, I had several conversations with women about a new Women’s Pro Baseball League, which was announced in October and is set to debut in 2026. “If it’s within driving distance, I’m going to every game,” Vicky Leone, a retired 58-year-old mother of two, told me.\n\nVicky was a regular at the camp—one of its pillars. Her team, the Bombers, which went undefeated over the weekend, was largely made up of women who had been playing together for years. When I ran into her at dinner one night, she was wearing a onesie covered in the face of her team’s coach, the former Yankees second baseman Homer Bush. She told me that in 2017, during her third year at the camp, she’d asked one of the Legends, Orlando Hernández, a former Yankees pitcher otherwise known as El Duque, to throw her a real fastball. She has no idea how fast he threw it, but she somehow made contact, and hit it out of George M. Steinbrenner Field.\n\n“I guess I timed it just right,” Vicky told me. “I didn’t even realize it went over the fence.” A player on the opposing team had to yell at her to stop sprinting as she rounded second, and when she got back to the dugout, her own teammates were losing their minds. A camp employee went and found the ball, and Hernández signed it for her. She still doesn’t know how it happened—“the baseball gods” intervened.\n\nVicky plays in three different softball leagues all year round, but playing baseball at camp for one weekend a year is important to her. “We’re like a sisterhood,” she said. Her teammates, many of whom are roughly her age, are all part of a generation of women who were snubbed by baseball. She grew up wanting to play and would often be dismissed with an Isn’t that cute? When she got older, she would talk about baseball, and boys would ignore her. When she started coaching baseball, parents didn’t want their sons to be assigned to her team.\n\nThe author loosens up before a game. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nNow she sees girls playing in the Little League World Series and has heard about the professional women’s league starting next year. “Sometimes I feel—I wish I was born now and not then, just so I could be a part of that.” But she has more enthusiasm than regret. “I would love to be a coach there, even an assistant coach, keeping book, whatever; I would love to do that,” she told me. “Am I going to? Probably not. But, you know, it’s a dream, and everybody’s got a dream.”\n\nThe idea for the Women’s Pro Baseball League was announced with a bare-bones press release. It revealed that the league would start next year with six teams “predominantly in the Northeast,” and that it had been co-founded by a lawyer, Keith Stein, alongside Justine Siegal, a well-known figure in the world of women’s baseball. Siegal grew up playing and then became a coach. She’s best known as the first woman to have pitched a major-league batting practice and for creating the nonprofit Baseball for All, which promotes girls’ participation in the sport.\n\nJemele Hill: Women’s college basketball is a worthy investment\n\n“My whole life has been about getting girls involved in baseball,” Siegal told me when we spoke in December. She is a co-owner of the new league, in charge of baseball operations, and will likely be its first commissioner. She rattled off part of her to-do list: The WPBL will need scouts, tryouts, contracts, stadiums. It will need to create a culture of girls’ baseball from scratch. And so, most important, it will need time and serious backing. Even with the patronage of the NBA, it took decades for the WNBA to reach the levels of interest it has today. The Professional Women’s Hockey League, which also started with six teams just last year, is wholly owned by the chairman of the Dodgers and his wife; they can afford to wait while it finds its footing. A new baseball league will similarly need team owners who are able to front huge costs and are willing to commit to something that might not be profitable for the foreseeable future.\n\nSiegal described her vision for the league by comparing it to Angel City FC, the women’s soccer team in Los Angeles. The fan base isn’t enormous, but it’s big enough. “The place is packed; it’s electric. And the athletes are being treated well, making money. They don’t need a second job. And girls know that it’s possible that they, too, could become a professional player.”\n\nThe only real precedent for a women’s baseball league is the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the subject of A League of Their Own. The league was created by the Chicago Cubs owner and chewing-gum mogul Philip K. Wrigley in 1943 to keep baseball alive as an entertainment industry while many of its brightest stars went to fight in World War II. He was initially the sole owner of the entire league, which was based in the Midwest and rostered only white women.\n\nThe Racine Belles and South Bend Blue Sox, both of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, face off in 1947. (Bettmann / Getty)\n\nThe league gave hundreds of women the opportunity to play baseball, and it put on some great games that impressed even seasoned baseball professionals and sportswriters. But there was always a tension, as depicted in the movie, between the gimmick and the game. The league had strict rules about feminine appearance and behavior—players wore skirts, went to charm school, and were taught to scratch at bars of soap to remove the dirt under their fingernails. The league was disbanded in 1954, and the idea was largely forgotten until the release of A League of Their Own.\n\nThe movie inspired a very brief period of trial and error. A women’s league based on the West Coast played a season and a half before its owner pulled the plug over low attendance, and the Coors Brewing Company sponsored the Colorado Silver Bullets, a barnstorming team managed by the beloved knuckleball pitcher Phil Niekro. “Give them the time all the men have had in this country to play, and you’re going to find a lot of good baseball players,” Niekro told The New York Times after the team’s first year (they went 6–38). The Bullets put on some great games and improved to a winning record in their fourth year. But marketing stunts are not meant for longevity and the Bullets, too, did not last.\n\nThe U.S. does have a national women’s baseball team, which was featured in the 2024 documentary See Her Be Her. That team competes every two to three years in a Women’s Baseball World Cup, which the U.S. last won in 2006; Japan, which dominates in women’s baseball, has been the champion in the past seven contests. Americans are far behind.\n\nSee Her Be Her, which aired on the MLB Network the week of the World Series, demonstrated the support that women’s baseball has been able to garner among former major-league stars, including Ichiro Suzuki and Cal Ripken Jr. Ripken, whose 21-year playing career with the Baltimore Orioles ended in 2001, is a member of one of the most famous baseball families in American history. During his own Hall of Fame career, he played alongside his brother Billy and was managed by his father, Cal Ripken Sr. His sister, Ellie, never got to play, though he describes her as throwing harder than he did as a child and growing into a massively talented athlete in other sports.\n\nRipken told me that he and his teammates had watched the Silver Bullets play exhibition games. “I always looked out there and saw my sister and thought, Wouldn’t my sister love to do this? ” I didn’t sense that he was putting on a show—more like it was flatly obvious to someone whose whole life is baseball that everyone should get a chance to enjoy playing it. “I wouldn’t say we were surprised, but our eyes would open, saying, ‘Man, these girls are really good,’ ” he said. “To try to figure out why that didn’t blossom at that time—sometimes they say good ideas, it’s a matter of timing. Maybe this is the right timing now.”\n\nOn Saturday morning at baseball camp, my beautiful Pinstripes took the lead quickly in our first game, which we won 6–2; again, I did not contribute a single hit.\n\nMy worst fear was realized as my teammates began to notice—or, probably, they had already noticed, and it just became impossible for them to credibly ignore—that I was by far the worst baseball player on our team. This inspired them to acts of kindness, such as high fives when I had done nothing to earn them and vociferous cheering whenever I was at the plate.\n\nIn the buffet line at lunch, Ray, our coach, tried to get at the root of my problem, which he diagnosed as mental. I told him about Brett Baty and his many struggles, and though he clearly had no idea who I was talking about or why I was so fixated on him, he seemed to agree that Baty and I had a similar problem, and it was in our brains. “What are you thinking when you’re up there?” he asked me. “I’m thinking, I hope I don’t miss the ball, ” I told him in the spirit of honesty, even though I was already 100 percent sure that this was not the correct thing to be thinking. Ray kindly told me that this was not the correct thing to be thinking.\n\nI never wanted to be a baseball player and my performance at baseball camp doesn’t matter. These games, however, were meaningful to women who, by playing them, were making peace with their childhood fantasies after many, many years. One such person was my teammate Susie McNamara, who at 53 years old was attending her third camp. One evening, she told me that she was doing so this time to mark the end of chemo treatments, which she’d finished two months prior. But the first time she came, in 2011, she’d wanted to prove something.\n\nSusie grew up in a baseball family. Her grandfather played for the Yankees’ farm team the Newark Bears. Her father was a police officer but also owned a baseball-card shop in Lambertville, New Jersey. He convinced everyone that it would be safe for her to start playing T-ball when she was 4 years old, and, later, that she could play Little League baseball with the boys. She was teased in school, she remembered, for wearing a baseball cap all the time (“It wasn’t, like, a fashion statement,” the way it is now) and for dreaming of being a Yankee.\n\nShe had to give that up when she was 12, and her primary option was softball. She would go on to play for Mount St. Mary’s, a Division I school in Maryland, but the coaching was terrible and the experience was miserable. Her sophomore year, the team’s record was one win, 31 losses. “I bet that one felt really good, though,” I suggested, but I was wrong. “That one broke my heart,” she said.\n\nWhen she showed up at camp the first time, she thought of it as her opportunity to demonstrate what she could do. The Legends that year included one of her heroes, Bucky Dent, who stopped and stared theatrically when she made an impressive play at third base. She also remembers Darryl Strawberry standing over her after she made a diving backhanded catch in foul territory and screaming, “That was outstanding!” She thought that weekend was probably the best she’d ever played in her life.\n\nIn our final game, against the Bambinos, the Pinstripes were on fire. The other women had perfected the team’s defense over the course of the weekend—it didn’t hurt that I didn’t touch the ball once—and the only thing left for us to accomplish was a hit from me. I was not the only one who felt this way. Others said it, including Leslie, who told me, “I’m committed to you getting a hit.” (And Lainey, who said, “Let’s go, Ottavino!”)\n\nIn my first at-bat, I swung on the first pitch and something happened. The ball dribbled up the first-base line and the first baseman scooped it up easily, tagging me as I passed. But a run scored! No hits, but one RBI!\n\nThe Pinstripes celebrate a victory in their last game of the weekend. (Zack Wittman for The Atlantic)\n\nAfter taking the lead in that inning, we were winning for the entire game, so the pressure on me—from that angle—was quite low. In my second at-bat, my team cheered wildly for me on every pitch. I hit the ball just foul down the first-base line, felt a momentary jolt of hope because of the hard contact, and then struck out. In my third and final at-bat, my team cheered wildly for me again, and I struck out again. “Next year!” I announced, in a voice that was supposed to be playful and make everybody feel less awkward, but actually sounded childish and a bit unhinged.\n\nIt was ridiculous how upset I was. I was shocked at myself. I hadn’t been expecting it, but the admonition of “no crying in baseball” became suddenly relevant—I had to duck into the tunnel for a few seconds to regain my composure. My teammates, who were geniuses, politely ignored me for five minutes. And then our careers as New York Yankees were over. We had won our final game and went home with a record of three wins and two losses, which you might notice is a .600 winning percentage, higher than that of the actual Yankees last year. We drank Miller Lite in the locker room and swapped phone numbers.\n\nI texted my college roommate from Staten Island that I would mail her all the Yankees merchandise that had been included in the price of admission. I texted my boyfriend that I had a new appreciation for the game and was humbled. I texted my dad, “One RBI!” There’s no crying in baseball, and the other thing they’re always saying is that baseball is a game of failure. If you have a really good batting average, you’re failing about 70 percent of the time. Most women, like most men who try the game of baseball, aren’t up to it. They crumble, like me, and like Brett Baty has in the past, though I am confident he will not do so this year.\n\nAt the start of her book, Jennifer Ring mentions the Burns baseball documentary, noting that it is more than 18 hours long but spends just a few minutes on women playing baseball in the 1800s, and then another few on the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and ’50s.\n\nThis is particularly strange because the episode about the ’60s and ’70s touches on other issues of the day—Vietnam, civil rights, social unrest—but makes no mention of NOW’s involvement in the Little League legal battle, which would seem to fit in fairly naturally. Baseball is the definitive story of the game in this country, which is why Ring brings it up. “He’s including it in his history, but he’s giving it the position that he thinks it deserves.”\n\nBaseball is for the fastidious—a game in which everything matters. Reflecting in 1981 on the past 50 years of his life as a fan, Roger Angell wrote: “All of us who have followed the game with intensity have found ourselves transformed into walking memory banks, humming with games won, games lost, batting averages and earned-run averages, games started and games saved, ‘magic numbers,’ final standings, lifetime marks, Series, seasons, decades, epochs.”\n\nEvery play is recorded. Every pitch is remembered. It all counts. Every mistake. Every miracle. You can hear the delight and shock in an announcer’s voice when they see something that has somehow never happened before in the history of millions of plays. If you watch enough baseball, you can just feel when something is really something. (Baty’s three-run homer at Tropicana Field, which disappeared into the late, great ceiling and never came down?) In a game in which everything matters, in which we who love it wish to see every possible outcome unfold, how can we stomach the absence of women’s baseball?",

        "content": "Sometimes, riding my bike around Oakland, California, on a cold morning—bumping over abandoned railroad tracks, through the shadows of new towers, under leafy trees, past the encampments—I try to imagine all the money flowing in and through the place. In high-school physics, we had to sketch diagrams that laid out all the different forces acting on an object. What if I could do the same, but for the economic pressures on a place?\n\nThe Bay Area sits between the manufacturing economies of Asia and the consumer economy of the United States. In recent decades, it has been profoundly reshaped by the system of trans-Pacific trade, in which American corporations import manufactured goods from Asia through port cities strung along the West Coast, from Seattle to Long Beach. It’s a system I call the “Pacific Circuit,” and I’ve spent the past nine years trying to understand it.\n\nFor technology companies and their executives, this system has proved incredibly lucrative. For the communities like Oakland through which the goods travel—designated by mid-century urban planners as environmental-sacrifice zones—the story has been very different. Sketch a force diagram for Oakland, and you’ll see large vectors representing the technology industry and the containerization of cargo tugging at the city, pulling it apart.\n\nLook around Silicon Valley today, at the gleaming buildings filled with white-collar workers sitting at their desks, and it can be hard to remember that electronics is actually a manufacturing industry. Few people today see Silicon Valley as a postindustrial landscape, but it once held so many factories that it had more Superfund cleanup sites than anywhere else in America. Only some of the production occurred in the valley itself; the electronics industry also pioneered the outsourcing of production, which ultimately hollowed out manufacturing in much of the country.\n\nThis article has been excerpted from Alexis Madrigal’s new book, The Pacific Circuit.\n\nOutsourcing was integral to the rise of the electronics industry from its beginning, as it split its labor among three workforces. The engineers and researchers, overwhelmingly white men, had groovy offices and competitive work cultures. At the same time, firms employed huge numbers of factory workers in the United States, right there in Santa Clara Valley. Nearly all of them were women, and many were from countries that had been destabilized by Cold War intrigues. Hiring managers praised “fast fingered Malaysians”; this was not a proud era of American corporate life. Finally, these companies had assembly plants throughout Asia. In Malaysia, the island of Penang became known as “Silicon Island.” Semiconductor companies there established grotesqueries such as the Miss Free Trade Zone competition. This supply chain was notable to people all around the world because it was new and important.\n\nFrom the March 2024 issue: Meet me in the eternal city\n\n“In California’s Silicon Valley, for example, research and development work is carried out by well paid, usually male scientists and engineers. Circuits are then photographically etched onto layers of silicon in nearby assembly plants by women—50% of whom are Asian or Latin—for low wages in a highly pressurized environment,” wrote the British sociologist Diane Elson for a 1983 conference, Women Working Worldwide. “The new stage is relocated to Southeast Asia where the silicon slices are cut up, bonded onto circuit boards, sealed in ceramic coating and tested. From there components are sent to other third world countries to be assembled into watches, etc., or sent back to the U.S.”\n\nFairchild Semiconductor, which spawned so many chip companies—including Intel—that they became known as the Fairchildren, began outsourcing parts of its production process to Hong Kong in 1963. By the early 1980s, labor activists at the Women Working Worldwide conference estimated that 50 percent of the people in Asia’s free-trade and export zones were working for electronics companies. And in the years since, the industry’s production has shifted ever more abroad.\n\nAmericans at the time noticed these changes, and were troubled by their implications. In the early 1970s, Huey Newton, the Black Panther leader, lived in sight of the Port of Oakland. He wrote an essay titled “The Technology Question,” arguing that the United States didn’t need to occupy and run Korea or Malaysia as colonies. Instead, it could direct the development of such countries from afar, so that they would provide the labor and consumers that the U.S. sought. Newton had a crucial realization about distributed supply chains: Because they dispersed the ethical responsibility for violence, no one even had to buy into the military-industrial complex’s aims. “The U.S. capitalist has been able to spread out his entire operation. You put together his machinery in parts,” he wrote, “thus you are not building a bomb, you are building a transistor.”\n\nNewton told the story of the writer Alex Haley visiting Africa. Haley saw “an old man walking down the road, holding something that he cherished to his ear. It was a small transistor radio that was zeroed in on the British broadcasting network.” The man had a product containing the fruits of Silicon Valley’s R&D, playing the mass media of the empire that had colonized his country. People liked the outputs of this technological system, and its downsides—which might have horrified them—were quite deliberately obscured from view.\n\nFor decades, San Francisco was the most important port on the West Coast. Cargoes were loaded and unloaded on finger piers that surrounded the city like a crown. But containerization changed all that. Holding the containers offloaded from ships until they could be taken by semitrucks to their eventual destinations required more land than the warehouses that had once housed such cargo had occupied. Finding hundreds of acres of storage in downtown San Francisco was impossible.\n\nInstead, cargo operations moved across the Bay, where the once-sleepy Port of Oakland bet heavily on containerization. Capturing more of the trade from Asia had long been Oakland’s goal. In 1952, the city released a report on developing its shoreline. “The industrialization of China and the rest of the Orient is late in arriving. Because of its magnitude it will inevitably produce fundamental modifications in the world’s economic and political structure,” the report declared. “No one can say exactly what the impact of the industrial revolution in Asia will be on the economy of the Pacific Coast; the potentialities are beyond imagination.”\n\nThe report was not wrong, but delivering on the potentialities took some technological development. From the perspective of men who worked on the docks, there were two components. “Containerization is the technological underpinning of the global economy,” the longshoreman (and political scientist) Herb Mills told a San Francisco historian in 1996. “Because you can bet your sweet ass if all them transmissions was being hand-handled out of the hold of a ship and put on a pallet board and sent ashore, rather than twenty tons of transmissions being in a goddamn container box, transmissions would still be built in Detroit.”\n\nAlong with the second component—“computers, rapid communication, inventory control, and all that stuff,” Mills argued—containerization “is why jobs have flowed out of the United States.” Silicon Valley created the technology to make global supply chains work, and containerization made them practical. The Bay Area’s manufacturing jobs flowed overseas, and manufactured goods flooded back through Oakland.\n\nFrom the October 2014 issue: Made in America, again\n\nOf course, goods don’t move themselves, even in a container. That takes a diesel truck. And if thousands of boxes are suddenly coming into a port, that means thousands of trucks will be too.\n\nIn Oakland, the neighborhood that had to absorb the influx of trucks to move the goods was overwhelmingly Black and quite poor. Since the 1930s, the city of Oakland had been trying to push out the mixed-race residents of the neighborhood to make way for industrial development. The city-planning engineer I. F. Shattuck recommended two strategies. One: Racially segregate the area by building a highway. That was largely successful. And two: Continue to site heavy industrial facilities in the area near the port to crowd out the residents. That was only half successful. The industry came, but the people stayed, despite deteriorating conditions. When more Black people came to Oakland during World War II for wartime jobs, many found themselves confined to the neighborhood by discrimination.\n\nBeginning in the late 1950s, under the guise of urban renewal, the city bulldozed huge chunks of the area’s main commercial strip, Seventh Street, destroying the commercial base of the Black community. It never recovered. The city of Oakland had declared chunks of the area blighted using a supposedly race-blind formula. In retrospect, it was more of an index statistic of environmental racism. The city’s elites had found a way to declare the areas where 98 percent of Oakland’s Black residents lived to be blighted, which, as the legal scholar Wendell Pritchett has argued, robbed everyone of all races who lived in those areas of their property rights. Versions of the same story played out in other Black neighborhoods that were adjacent to ports.\n\nThe Pacific Circuit has one more link. As the U.S. pushed countries to develop export-oriented economies, many of those countries found it advantageous to hold dollar-denominated assets. One reason that Americans have been able to take on debt is that many other countries have been more than willing to hold mortgage-backed securities and other financial instruments. With so much juice flowing through our real-estate system, it’s no wonder that prices have spiraled upward.\n\nIn the years after the Great Recession, rising real-estate prices in urban areas led many white Americans to buy homes in Black neighborhoods—in places like West Oakland. That is to say, the Pacific Circuit helps underpin gentrification, which has upended our cities in ways that we’re still figuring out.\n\nThe share of wealth held by the bottom 50 percent of Americans has not increased in the past 40 years. Many of our indicators of Black-white inequality are as high as they were in the mid-1960s, just a few years after the legal dismantling of Jim Crow. In America’s port cities, the professional classes have gained high-paying jobs, abundant credit, and appreciating home values. At the same time, the working classes have seen their jobs go overseas and their neighborhoods become unaffordable.\n\nOakland has a way of concentrating the power and problems of our country. As I worked on my book over the years, I couldn’t help but notice a bifurcation in my experience of this place. Many of my affluent neighbors are coming to see themselves more as nodes in a network of deliveries and pickups than as citizens of a specific place. Apps are making all kinds of services better and more convenient, even as they deepen our dependency on far-off companies and countries. But all this convenience comes at a steep cost. Oakland is struggling to provide essential public services, the kind that can’t be ordered up on an app. The superstar cities that once seemed immune to the emptying out of Main Streets across the country are now experiencing their own version of what happened to rural areas during Walmart’s expansion. Take a trip around Oakland’s downtown, and you’ll see the vacant storefronts.\n\nAfter 50 years, the Pacific Circuit has become so powerful that it is breaking our cities. Many city officials and local entrepreneurs keep waiting for the effects of the pandemic to wear off, for the streets to refill and for the old normal to return. It might not. The pandemic pulled forward a structural alteration in the urban economy. Each DoorDash order that gets delivered or Amazon package that gets left on a doorstep makes running a local business that much harder. The old spatial order of the city is now overlaid by a digital one that’s linked to the global economy through companies such as Temu and Uber and Apple. What might be wonderful for an individual (so convenient!) has generated a collective crisis of the city.\n\nWill Donald Trump’s tariffs change all this? I doubt it. Perhaps some other countries and trading partners will benefit, but the realities of the labor arbitrage that the longshoreman Mills observed remain. Even our most successful domestic manufacturers now rely on components manufactured all over the globe.\n\nCould we, as consumers, simply stop using the logistical apps that have burrowed their way into our hearts and habits? I’m reminded of the man Alex Haley met. We love the outputs of the Pacific Circuit, despite their negative effects on the places we live.\n\nIn the 2010s, only one coffee shop stood on the west end of Seventh Street. Sometimes it seemed to be called the Seventh Street Cafe, other times the Revolution Cafe. If it was open, jazz was usually playing. The walls were adorned with old Black Panthers paraphernalia, a Malcolm X poster, an Aztec god, and the symbol for the artist formerly known as Prince. The café was attached to a big open lot filled with old furniture and little improvised structures on the verge of collapse.\n\nThe café, however, had almost nothing for sale. One time I went in and found a black-beanie-wearing Katrina refugee named Cedric tending the place. He was serious, smart, and had the sort of dark view of America you might expect from someone who got out of New Orleans because he thought the levee was going to break. I told him about the book I was working on. “Technology always gonna have a downside,” he said. He compared it to sci-fi shows. “It’s like when they go out in space and shit and they be looking for stuff and then they bring it back here and the people say, ‘We didn’t want that shit! Why you go out looking for that shit?’”\n\nNo one asked for this world, and yet here we are. Trucks rumbled by. I was the only customer. I wanted to support the place, so I tried to order food, but despite the extensive menu on the wall, all they actually had was coffee and day-old coffee cake. So that’s what I bought.\n\nThis is how local businesses work. You buy something for a few dollars—cake, coffee—and then you sell it, maybe, for a few dollars more than you bought it for. Do it a few times, and you can pay Cedric. Do it a few more times, and you can keep the doors open. This is the economy as we like to imagine it.\n\nBut this is not how everyone makes money. Private equity firms, hedge funds, and venture capitalists take in money from public and private pension funds, Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, huge asset managers, university endowments, and banks. In 2023, the world’s largest asset managers had more than $113 trillion under management, and they are willing to scour the earth to increase their returns.\n\nWhile places like the Revolution Cafe have to rely on individual residents of West Oakland to come in and spend $3 so they can make 50 cents, companies such as Alphabet or Meta are not constrained by geography. They can show ads to the entire world, extract money from the internet, and pull the bulk of it to their headquarters.\n\nOr take Uber, which took in billions of dollars of investment in the 2010s, a large chunk of it through the Japanese SoftBank, which itself drew funds from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Uber was deliberately losing money to keep fares low to juice its growth; in a very real sense, when you took an Uber ride, the cost of your fare was subsidized by pumping oil out of the ground in Ghawar province of eastern Saudi Arabia. How can a regular cab company compete with that?\n\nEven the companies operating out of the Port of Oakland have almost no relationship to the neighborhood economy anymore. The shipping and stevedoring outfits are headquartered in Asia or Europe. The goods they import and export almost all come from somewhere else. Oakland captures some tiny trickle of funds, but the big money flowing through the port exists on another plane of economic existence, inaccessible to anyone in West Oakland except through the very narrow conduit of dockwork, where the longshoremen who remain capture a tiny percentage of the value of the goods passing through as wages.\n\nRead: Corner stores are the new darlings of the global tech industry\n\nBattles over urban change tend to take on a cultural cast—coffee shops and dog walkers replacing barbecue joints and barbers. The real disagreement, though, is not over lattes but over whether a rising tide lifts all boats. And in city after city, the rising tide looks more like a flood. It is more than metaphor that the homeless encampments, filled with flotsam and jetsam, look like the remnants of a natural disaster. They are testament to our emergency. If you’re poor, there’s little you can do to stem the forces reshaping cities except wait and watch for the signs of change, disturbances in the wind or the tastes of the air that say Get out now.\n\nWe need a new way of talking about what’s happening in cities, one that faces the realities of the world that the pandemic accelerated into being. We might like to think that our individual behavior is separate from the decisions made by the technology companies, the flow of global supply chains, the dynamics of the real-estate system, or the racial history of cities—but it is not. City dwellers, rich and poor alike, are stuck in a set of systems that are generating ever rising housing costs, mass homelessness, displacement, and an attenuated urban life.\n\nThe fates of the residents of superstar cities are more connected to Main Street America and its workers than many think. And in that realization lies the potential for a different political coalition that can make a different set of choices.\n\nThe Polish theorist Zygmunt Bauman argued that we now live under conditions of “liquid modernity,” by which he meant that power no longer has handles that regular people can grab onto. Power and capital, when confronted, simply move, flowing to less challenging, less democratic places with cozier tax structures. To slightly paraphrase Bauman, we now live in a world where it often feels as if anything can happen but nothing can be done.\n\nBut some people have figured out ways to get a hold on power. All these liquid systems have to make contact with the physical realm at some point, and such chokepoints can have an outsized effect. Longshoremen’s power derives from controlling labor, and the ILWU has organized all the ports on the West Coast, creating a network that accounts for liquid power. The anti-fossil-fuel activists of the No Coal in Oakland coalition have stymied the creation of a bulk-export terminal in West Oakland. Climate change is a global issue, but it’s local activists who have kept coal in the ground in Utah.\n\nSimilarly, organizations such as the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative are pulling land, housing, and commercial properties out of liquid real-estate markets. They are separating property’s role as an asset from its role as a vital component of civic life, be it a roof over your head, a wildlife corridor, or a legacy business.\n\nThese organizations are acting locally, but their interventions take into account the nature of global power. That’s the lesson from the ports and docks. Liquid power and capital eventually have to touch the land, and when local action takes place in those places, the activists and reformers can use the circuits that supercharge our economy to scale their own impact.\n\nThis article has been excerpted from Alexis Madrigal’s new book, The Pacific Circuit.",

        "content": "Julian Barnes opens Changing My Mind, his brisk new book about our unruly intellects, with a quote famously attributed to the economist John Maynard Keynes: “When the facts change, I change my mind.” It’s a fitting start for an essay on our obliviousness to truth, because Keynes didn’t say that—or not exactly that. The economist Paul Samuelson almost said it in 1970 (replacing “facts” with “events”) and in 1978 almost said it again (this time, “information”), attributing it to Keynes. His suggestion stuck, flattering our sense of plausibility—it’s the sort of thing Keynes would have said—and now finds itself repeated in a work of nonfiction. Our fallibility is very much on display.\n\nNot that Barnes would deny that he makes mistakes. The wry premise of his book is that he’s changed his mind about how we change our minds, evolving from a Keynesian faith in fact and reason to a framing inspired by the Dadaist Francis Picabia’s aphorism “Our heads are round so that our thoughts can change direction.” (In this case, the citation is accurate.) Barnes concludes that our beliefs are changed less by argument or evidence than by emotion: “I think, on the whole, I have become a Picabian rather than a Keynesian.”\n\nBarnes is an esteemed British novelist, not a social scientist—one of the things he hasn’t changed his mind about is “the belief that literature is the best system we have of understanding the world”—but his shift in perspective resonates with a host of troubling results in social psychology. Research in recent decades shows that we are prone to “confirmation bias,” systematically interpreting new information in ways that favor our existing views and cherry-picking reasons to uphold them. We engage in “motivated reasoning,” believing what we wish were true despite the evidence. And we are subject to “polarization”: As we divide into like-minded groups, we become more homogeneous and more extreme in our beliefs.\n\nIf a functioning democracy is one in which people share a common pool of information and disagree in moderate, conciliatory ways, there are grounds for pessimism about its prospects. For Barnes, this is not news: “When I look back at the innumerable conversations I’ve had with friends and colleagues about political matters over the decades,” he laments, “I can’t remember a single, clear instance, when a single, clear argument has made me change my mind—or when I have changed someone else’s mind.” Where Barnes has changed his mind—about the nature of memory, or policing others’ language, or the novelists Georges Simenon and E. M. Forster—he attributes the shift to quirks of experience or feeling, not rational thought.\n\nBoth Barnes and the social scientists pose urgent, practical questions. What should we do about the seeming inefficacy of argument in politics? How can people persuade opponents on issues such as immigration, abortion, or trans rights in cases where their interpretation of evidence seems biased? Like the Russian trolls who spread divisive rhetoric on social media, these questions threaten one’s faith in what the political analyst Anand Giridharadas has called “the basic activity of democratic life—the changing of minds.” The situation isn’t hopeless; in his recent book, The Persuaders, Giridharadas portrays activists and educators who have defied the odds. But there is a risk of self-fulfilling prophecy: If democratic discourse comes to seem futile, it will atrophy.\n\nRead: The cognitive biases tricking your brain\n\nUrgent as it may be, this fear is not what animates Barnes in Changing My Mind. His subject is not moving other minds, but rather changing our own. It’s easy and convenient to forget that confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, and group polarization are not problems unique to those who disagree with us. We all interpret evidence with prejudice, engage in self-deception, and lapse into groupthink. And though political persuasion is a topic for social scientists, the puzzle of what I should do when I’m afraid that I’m being irrational or unreliable is a philosophical question I must inevitably ask, and answer, for myself.\n\nThat’s why it feels right for Barnes to approach his topic through autobiography, in the first person. This genre goes back to Descartes’ Meditations: epistemology as memoir. And like Descartes before him, Barnes confronts the specter of self-doubt. “If Maynard Keynes changed his mind when the facts changed,” he admits, “I find that facts and events tend to confirm me in what I already believe.”\n\nYou might think that this confession of confirmation bias would shake his confidence, but that’s not what happens to Barnes, or to many of us. Learning about our biases doesn’t necessarily make them go away. In a chapter on his political convictions, Barnes is cheerfully dogmatic. “When asked my view on some public matter nowadays,” he quips, “I tend to reply, ‘Well, in Barnes’s Benign Republic …’” He goes on to list some of BBR’s key policies:\n\nFor a start … public ownership of all forms of mass transport, and all forms of power supply—gas, electric, nuclear, wind, solar … Absolute separation of Church and State … Full restoration of all arts and humanities courses at schools and universities … and, more widely, an end to a purely utilitarian view of education.\n\nThis all sounds good to me, but it’s announced without a hint of argument. Given Barnes’s doubts about the power of persuasion, that makes sense. If no one is convinced by arguments, anyway, offering them would be a waste of time. Barnes does admit one exception: “Occasionally, there might be an area where you admit to knowing little, and are a vessel waiting to be filled.” But, he adds, “such moments are rare.” The discovery that reasoning is less effective than we hoped, instead of being a source of intellectual humility, may lead us to opt out of rational debate.\n\nYascha Mounk: The doom spiral of pernicious polarization\n\nBarnes doesn’t overtly make this case—again, why would he? But it’s implicit in his book and it’s not obviously wrong. When we ask what we should think in light of the social science of how we think, we run into philosophical trouble. I can’t coherently believe that I am basically irrational or unreliable, because that belief would undermine itself: another conviction I can’t trust. More narrowly, I can’t separate what I think about, say, climate change from the apparent evidence. It’s paradoxical to doubt that climate change is real while thinking that the evidence for climate change is strong, or to think, I don’t believe that climate change is real, although it is. My beliefs are my perspective on the world; I cannot step outside of them to change them “like some rider controlling a horse with their knees,” as Barnes puts it, “or the driver of a tank guiding its progress.”\n\nSo what am I to do? One consolation, of sorts, is that my plight—and yours—predates the findings of social science. Philosophers like Descartes long ago confronted the perplexities of the subject trapped within their own perspective. The limits of reasoning are evident from the moment we begin to do it. Every argument we make contains premises an opponent can dispute: They can always persist in their dissent, so long as they reject, time and again, some basic assumption we take for granted.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that our beliefs are unjustified. Failure to convert the skeptic—or the committed conspiracy theorist—need not undermine our current convictions. Nor does recent social science prove that we’re inherently irrational. In conditions of uncertainty, it’s perfectly reasonable to put more faith in evidence that fits what we take to be true than in unfamiliar arguments against it. Confirmation bias may lead to deadlock and polarization, but it is better than hopelessly starting from scratch every time we are contradicted.\n\nNone of this guarantees that we’ll get the facts right. In Meditations, Descartes imagines that the course of his experience is the work of an evil demon who deceives him into thinking the external world is real. Nowadays, we might think of brains in vats or virtual-reality machines from movies like The Matrix. What’s striking about these thought experiments is that their imagined subjects are rational even though everything they think they know is wrong. Rationality is inherently fallible.\n\nWhat social science reveals is that we are more fallible than we thought. But this doesn’t mean that changing our mind is a fool’s errand. New information might be less likely to lead us to the truth than we would like to believe—but that doesn’t mean it has no value at all. More evidence is still better than less. And we can take concrete steps to maximize its value by mitigating bias. Studies suggest, for instance, that playing devil’s advocate improves our reliability. Barnes notwithstanding, novel arguments can move our mind in the right direction.\n\nRead: Changing your mind can make you less anxious\n\nAs Descartes’ demon shows, our environment determines how far being rational correlates with being right. At the evil-demon limit, not at all: We are trapped in the bubble of our own experience. Closer to home, we inhabit epistemic bubbles that impede our access to information. But our environment is something we can change. Sometimes it’s good to have an open mind and to consider new perspectives. At other times, it’s not: We know we’re right and the risk of losing faith is not worth taking. We can’t ensure that evidence points us to the truth, but we can protect ourselves from falling into error. As Barnes points out, memory is “a key factor in changing our mind: we need to forget what we believed before, or at least forget with what passion and certainty we believed it.” When we fear that our environment will degrade, that we’ll be subject to misinformation or groupthink, we can record our fundamental values and beliefs so as not to forsake them later.\n\nSeen in this light, Barnes’s somewhat sheepish admission that he has never really changed his mind about politics seems, if not entirely admirable, then not all bad. Where the greater risk is that we’ll come to accept the unacceptable, it’s just as well to be dogmatic.\n\n*Lead image credit: Illustration by The Atlantic.

        "content": "Every young feminist, at some point, bumps up against the limits of her ideals. For me, it happened in my early 20s. My consciousness freshly raised and my mind spongier than ever, I spent my evenings imbibing the no-nonsense feminism of Vivian Gornick, the big-hearted feminism of bell hooks, the caustic feminism of Virginie Despentes. On the page, I underlined their wisdom about forging romances rooted in equality and embracing solidarity with other women; yet in life, I chased the approval of apathetic men and harbored resentment for my beautiful, successful peers. I had done all the reading but felt that I was failing the test.\n\nThe narrator of Michelle de Kretser’s sharp-witted novel Theory & Practice, a Sri Lankan–born grad student at a university in Melbourne, has a similar, self-flagellating feeling early in the book. She has discovered that her boyfriend is cheating on her, and, to her horror, she wants the other woman—“a smart, good-looking, outspoken feminist”—dead. “I’d raged silently, inwardly,” she recalls, “censored by an internal critic who found jealousy a trite, despicable emotion, a morbid symptom that ran counter to feminist practice.” She is immediately ashamed of her reaction. Yet maybe her lapses and mine were not moral failings but case studies in what de Kretser (who, like her narrator, is Australian and was born in Sri Lanka) calls the inevitable “breakdowns between theory and practice.” Feminism is a set of political principles, not social prescriptions. Ideology rarely maps neatly onto everyday existence—and it’s in these gaps that we learn the most about who we are, what we believe, and what we really want.\n\nRead: How should feminists have sex now?\n\nThe novel begins in 1986, when the narrator has just moved from Sydney to Melbourne to write a thesis about gender roles in the late novels of her hero, Virginia Woolf. Invigorated by the promise of a life of the mind, she buys a dress in a color she describes as “Intellectual Black.” She gets an apartment in a vibrant bohemian enclave bursting with scholars and artists that sits a few steps from the beach. The nearby ocean becomes a model for the kind of knowledge she seeks: something to “carry me beyond the limits of myself,” even at “the risk of drowning.” But in truth, there is no escaping oneself—no city, no dress, no course of study with the power to liberate a person from who they really are.\n\nNot long after breaking up with her boyfriend, the narrator starts sleeping with Kit, a wealthy engineering student with an equally wealthy girlfriend, Olivia. Their trysts are aboveboard, Kit says, because he and Olivia have “a deconstructed relationship.” The narrator convinces herself that she’s fine with this. She’s a “modern woman,” she thinks, “perfectly content with his body’s undeconstructed need of mine.” But that idealized self buckles under erotic strain, and the narrator soon grows obsessed with Olivia: She fantasizes about breaking into her apartment and leaves marks on Kit’s body before she sends him back to her. In a nod to the epistemic value of their dalliance, Kit and the narrator refer to sex as “studying.” Since her thesis involves thinking critically about gender roles, what better way to study than to participate in a three-sided heterosexual power struggle?\n\nAs the narrator discovers, neither our politics nor our principles preclude—or protect us from—unwieldy emotions, embarrassing impulses, or subconscious desires. What’s more, the love triangle forces her to tussle with questions of not only gender but also class. A brown-skinned, first-generation immigrant, she’s opposed to Kit and Olivia’s inborn privilege and the socioeconomic stratification that enforces it; she also wants what they have. “I wanted to join the bourgeoisie,” she says, “and I wanted to destroy it.” The two truths coexist, however uneasily, rather than canceling each other out.\n\nThe narrator’s research into Woolf, whose picture she tapes above her desk, reveals another fissure between her ideals—namely, the writer she looks up to—and reality. Woolf looms large in her imagination not only as a pathbreaking feminist writer but also as a fellow survivor of childhood sexual abuse. Reading Woolf’s diary, the narrator is moved by her description of the inner turmoil that lingers after an experience of harm. “What is the word for so dumb and mixed a feeling?” Woolf writes. The narrator recognizes the sentiment: “Dumb, mixed feelings,” she muses, “are knowledge that lives outside language and outside time.”\n\nBut the narrator faces mixed feelings of a different kind when she reads another diary entry, in which Woolf cruelly describes the Sri Lankan national hero E. W. Perera as a “poor little mahogany coloured wretch.” It feels like a painful, personal blow. How to account for this wrinkle in her image of the beloved author? Again, by holding two truths simultaneously. The “Woolfmother,” as the narrator calls her, is both an intellectual giant and a blatant racist. A friend suggests that instead of abandoning her study of Woolf, the narrator enter into a conversation with her blighted hero. The friend’s prescription: “Write back to Woolf.”\n\nThe narrator’s white adviser, Paula, dismisses the idea of shifting her thesis to account for Woolf’s racism; she suggests that the narrator focus on Woolf’s public work rather than her private thoughts. But the narrator feels she must “reckon with [the] mahogany-colored wretch” who has “taken up squatting on a corner of my desk.” She notices that both she and Paula have the same poster of Woolf, but Paula’s, notably, is “framed and under glass.” Where Paula wants to keep her idol’s legacy pristine, the narrator wants to wrestle with Woolf—even if it leaves a mark.\n\nPaula, whom de Kretser refers to as the English Department’s “Designated Feminist,” has a rather low tolerance for complexity: At one point, the narrator learns that she once wrote a scathing pan of a woman’s debut novel, tarring the book as “unfeminist” because its female protagonist despairs over the end of her affair with a man. As it turns out, Paula’s boyfriend had left her for this novelist not long before. When it comes to feminism—and to life itself—the narrator prefers to mine the “messy, human truth” that she sees in her adviser’s book review rather than worship a passed-down pantheon of “flawless feminist heroes.” She wants to make sense of the gradations and complications of “female experience”—that is, to go beyond theory and account for practice. Indeed, over the course of the novel, most of her learning happens outside the classroom, through encounters and conversations with other people. As fascinating and edifying as theory can be, it can rarely teach us as much about ourselves as everyday life.\n\nRead: Escaping the patriarchy for good\n\nTheory & Practice is sly, spiky, and brilliant: an intellectual coming-of-age story that accounts for all that can’t be learned in the academy—or in books. The novel’s meta structure bears this out: The first few pages belong to what appears to be an entirely different book, ostensibly written and abruptly scrapped by the narrator. The writing has “stalled” because, she says, “I was discovering that I no longer wanted to write novels that read like novels,” which she finds deceptive in their tidiness. With this observation, the line between author and narrator blurs: Aspects of the book are clearly lifted from de Kretser’s own life—the novel’s Australian cover even bears a picture of a college-aged de Kretser—yet it warns against drawing any neat conclusions. The story that follows flits confidently between modes: memoir and novel, personal and political, fact and fiction. Essayistic asides commingle with tender memories; heady emotions intrude on serious philosophizing. The aim, the narrator says, is to capture a sense of “formlessness and mess”—in other words, real life.\n\nDe Kretser’s attraction to chaos and contradiction made sense to me; I myself have struggled to make my disparate thoughts and desires cohere. It was only when I began reading about the formless, messy lives of various feminists in biographies and memoirs—rather than, say, their works of polemic or philosophy—that I no longer felt like a failure. Their mistakes, their resentments, and their embarrassing, often unenlightened feelings were so much like my own. I realized that this painful gap between who one is and who one wishes to be is universal—and no amount of knowledge can assuage it. The narrator feels something similar the first time she sees her own “everyday, unglamorous world” reflected back to her in a film about a young feminist who rages against her ex-boyfriend and his new lover. “What made my heart run like a hare,” she says, “was hearing my mind exposed.” And it’s only through this kind of exposure—of our personal lapses, of the unfairness of love, of the faults of our heroes—that we can get anywhere near the truth.",

        "title": "What the Border-Hawk Catholics Get Wrong",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "In a letter to America’s bishops, Pope Francis last month decried a “major crisis” unfolding in the United States: “the initiation of a program of mass deportations.” He called on “all the faithful of the Catholic Church, and all men and women of good will, not to give in to narratives that discriminate against and cause unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters.”\n\nBorder-hawk Catholics were scandalized.\n\nR. R. Reno, the editor of the traditionalist religious magazine First Things, denounced the pope as “an accelerationist” who believes that a “borderless fraternity is a true utopia.” The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh characterized the letter as “pure nonsense,” while the Heritage Foundation’s head, Kevin Roberts, called it a “veiled shot” at Catholic supporters of Donald Trump. Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, addressed Francis directly: “I got harsh words for the pope … He ought to fix the Catholic Church and concentrate on his work, and leave border enforcement to us.” (Each of these critiques came before Francis’s hospitalization last month.)\n\nThroughout Francis’s papacy, some American Catholics have accused him of prioritizing a platitudinal liberalism over doctrinal orthodoxy. But on the issue of immigration, Francis’s critics are the ones who appear to be sidestepping Catholic tradition—even while claiming to uphold it.\n\nStart with the incident that prompted the current intra-Catholic dispute over immigration: a back-and-forth between the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and America’s highest-profile Catholic official. After the Trump administration authorized Immigration and Customs Enforcement to apprehend people in churches and other social-service ministries, the USCCB called the move “contrary to the common good.” Vice President J. D. Vance came to the administration’s defense.\n\n“There’s this old-school—and I think it’s a very Christian concept, by the way,” Vance told Fox News’s Sean Hannity in late January, “that you love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country, and then after that you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.” Vance’s rationale sparked intense debate in Catholic circles, especially online: His supporters cheered his use of religious rhetoric, while his detractors accused him of ignoring key parts of the Gospel.\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: ‘A very Christian concept’\n\nChristian theologians through the ages have indeed articulated versions of this principle—called ordo amoris, or “the order of love”—including Church fathers such as Saint Augustine in the fourth century (“Since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special regard to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or circumstance, are brought into closer connection with you”) and Saint Thomas Aquinas in the 13th (“We ought to love more specially those who are united to us by ties of blood”). True Christian love, the principle suggests, is guided not by an impulse to maximize utility but by a compassionate preference toward the personal and proximate.\n\nMany of those same Catholic theologians, however, believed that this preference is conditional, not absolute. As Aquinas himself wrote in the Summa Theologiae: “In certain cases one ought, for instance, to succor a stranger, in extreme necessity, rather than one’s own father, if he is not in such urgent need.” Rightly ordered love prioritizes close kinship—all things being equal. But it’s not ignorant of context or necessity.\n\nBased on the outcry that followed Francis’s letter, you’d be forgiven for thinking it marked a dramatic departure from the views of his predecessors. It didn’t. “To welcome” the undocumented migrant “and to show him solidarity is a duty of hospitality and fidelity to Christian identity itself,” Pope John Paul II said in 1995. His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, remarked that immigrants and native-born people alike “have the same right to enjoy the goods of the earth whose destination is universal, as the social doctrine of the Church teaches.” In 2010, he selected “one human family” as the theme for the World Day of Migrants and Refugees.\n\nTo be sure, none of the three most recent pontiffs argued that immigration is an unbounded good. Benedict XVI granted that nations are entitled to “regulate migration flows,” while John Paul II thought that “illegal immigration should be prevented.” Francis himself noted in his letter “the right of a nation to defend itself and keep communities safe” from violent criminals, and he stressed the need for “policy that regulates orderly and legal migration.”\n\nStill, some of Francis’s critics interpreted the letter as a declaration that countries should admit every migrant who doesn’t have a criminal record. They typically cited this line: “The rightly formed conscience” should not equate the “illegal status of some migrants with criminality.” But Francis has previously acknowledged that stricter enforcement can be necessary. In a 60 Minutes interview last year, the pope said that a migrant should be received initially but, in certain situations, “maybe you have to send him back.”\n\nSome might reasonably find all of this to be another instance of Francis’s imprecision—as a Catholic myself, I understand their frustration—or think it imprudent for him to intervene in such a contested and complicated political matter. True enough, his letter wasn’t primarily concerned with balancing competing interests; his goal, it seems, was to emphasize what he regards as the moral error that underlies much of the immigration debate in the United States. If in doing so the pope is guilty of eschewing some nuance, his critics seem altogether uninterested in the deficiency he was pointing out.\n\nThey wouldn’t have to look very far. The first Trump administration enforced a brutal policy that separated thousands of parents from their children, as my colleague Caitlin Dickerson reported. (In October, a journalist asked Homan whether there’s a way to carry out mass deportations without separating families; he replied, “Sure there is: Families can be deported together.”) In many cases, restrictionist sentiment has given way to outright xenophobia, perhaps most memorably during Trump’s 2024 campaign, when he scapegoated Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. (Matt Walsh contributed to the panic in a video titled “Third World Immigrants Are Ruining Our Towns and Eating Our Pets.”) And as the second Trump administration froze funds for initiatives such as the USCCB’s refugee-resettlement program, the bishops’ conference laid off 50 workers last month. (Responding to pushback from the USCCB over the administration’s loosened ICE guidelines, Vance suggested that the bishops are more “worried about their bottom line” than about caring for migrants.)\n\nWhile the White House posts deportation ASMR videos and ICE ramps up raids that sometimes mistakenly detain citizens, it’s hard to read Francis’s letter as gratuitous pining for a borderless utopia. Rather, the pope seems to be making a plea for rhetoric and policies that respect the dignity of every human life—a long-standing Catholic concern that U.S. immigration-policy debates so often ignore.",

        "content": "The Anti-Social Century\n\nAmericans are now spending more time alone than ever, Derek Thompson wrote in the February issue. It’s changing our personalities, our politics, and even our relationship to reality.\n\nDerek Thompson’s article resonated with me deeply, but I think he missed one key reason people stay at home: financial necessity. As a 28-year-old raised on TV, I often succumb to the urge to binge my favorite shows at home because it feels more comfortable than going out. And as an early-career social worker with a small salary and little disposable income, staying home also feels more responsible. With the cost of everything—dinner, drinks, concert tickets—on the rise, I have to pick and choose where to spend my money outside the house. Even hosting a gathering and providing snacks can be costly. Especially during the cold winter months, it’s challenging to find cheap things to do with other people.\n\nExplore the April 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

And maybe I’ll start talking with strangers on the train.\n\nAlexandra Lubbe\n\nSt. Louis, Mo.\n\nAs a Boomer who came of age in the ’60s, I recall how my hometown, Nashville, closed public swimming pools to avoid giving minorities equal access. No doubt, the erosion of a broader social cohesion began as taxpayers willingly—and sometimes enthusiastically—supported the demise of the vital infrastructure that Derek Thompson highlights.\n\nMark Forrester\n\nElkton, Md.\n\n“The Anti-Social Century” is a much-needed update on our national alienation from one another. I’ve always thought that the foundational work on this subject was Philip Slater’s The Pursuit of Loneliness: American Culture at the Breaking Point, published in 1970. I read it a few years after it came out, as a college student, and I felt that no book did more to explain the cultural and economic forces that lead to our individual isolation. Slater would be appalled but perhaps not surprised to see how the trends he identified in the previous century have escalated in this one. Among other things, he noted that our obsessive devotion to rugged individualism separates us not only from one another, but from nature itself. “We feel that nature has no business claiming a connection with us,” he wrote, “and perhaps one day we will prove ourselves correct.” Some 50 years later, we seem to be well on our way to fulfilling Slater’s dark prophecy.\n\nScott Sparling\n\nLake Oswego, Ore.\n\nAfter I retired from a career that involved regular human interaction, my wife noticed that I wasn’t experiencing the relaxation usually associated with retirement; instead, I was unsettled. She suggested that I try driving for Uber, and it’s made a huge difference in my life. Driving has become my personal answer to isolation, and it’s a hobby I intend to pursue as long as practical.\n\nI’m amazed by how many people of all backgrounds enjoy engaging with a stranger. As I drive, we share small slices of our lives and usually part with an elevated sense of contentment. The notable exceptions to this rule are high-school-age kids, who I’ve noticed struggle to have easy conversations. It’s sad because, although we share a city, we have little insight into one another’s daily reality, into how our lives intersect outside the Uber experience. I sense that there is a lot to learn and understand.\n\nHarry David Snook\n\nMadison, Wis.\n\nI live in western North Carolina, in an area devastated by Hurricane Helene. A few miles down the road, the Swannanoa River rose so quickly that people I knew had to swim out of their windows to survive.\n\nI’m not as plugged in as most people. But when the storm hit and the phone towers went down, I finally met my neighbors for the first time since I moved to my street two years ago. Without technology, everyone went outside. In that new landscape, we cared for one another, and I need you to know how beautiful that was: When emergency radio broadcasts replaced our phones, we learned our neighbors’ names.\n\nI don’t mean to diminish the lives lost or the landscapes irrevocably altered, but it’s hard not to mourn that post-flood camaraderie now that everyone has shut themselves away again. Helene brought about a different world. Perhaps calamities have the power to momentarily suspend the sickness of American modernity that Derek Thompson so aptly describes. It did for us, if only briefly.\n\nMcKinnon Brenholz\n\nBlack Mountain, N.C.\n\nI am 27, and I fall on the cusp of Gen Z and Millennial, not quite fitting into either generational category. I spent my childhood playing outside and on the internet. When I was a teenager, social media was just beginning to become popular. I was shy in school and found myself becoming isolated in the 2010s, retreating into online spaces to find friendship. I stayed lonely and online until adulthood, when a sudden interest in and love of hiking propelled me outside and into the “real world.” Since then, I have joined a religious community and become dear friends with my neighbors; I strike up conversations with strangers on planes and in public. My life could not be more different, and when I reflect on the time I spent alone and online, I think of how wonderful my life could have been if I had dared to move outside my comfort zone sooner.\n\nWhen I speak with friends my age, so many of them acknowledge that we are better off cultivating relationships offline—and yet we all still spend so much time online. My hope is that community organizing and free public spaces will become more common as we all look around and realize that none of us is happy with the status quo.\n\nChristina Tavella\n\nBoston, Mass.\n\nDerek Thompson replies:\n\nI think the most important point of my article is exactly what Christina Tavella notes in closing. The anti-social century is, among other things, a story of the vast gulf between our stated and revealed preferences—the lives we say we want and the lives we lead. Very few people will tell you that the way they wish to spend the scarce hours and days of their lives is to be more alone with each passing year, or to spend more time with their screens and less time with their friends and families. The fact that we choose aloneness over and over again suggests that aloneness is serving us, in some way. But I strongly believe that it is serving our shallow desire for convenience rather than our deeper need for connection and meaning. We have built a culture organized around the frictionless acquisition of dopamine. Are we sure we’re meant to do that?\n\nBehind the Cover\n\nIn this month’s cover story, “Growing Up Murdoch,” McKay Coppins reports on the bitter fight within the Murdoch family to control its media empire.

Sign up for it here.\n\nWhen my older sister, Ellen, was 4 or 5, she and a neighbor girl were playing in the front yard of our Berkeley house. The friend, who lived across the street, was the daughter of a Lutheran minister, who our father thought was a pompous and ridiculous person. Suddenly, Ellen slammed through the kitchen door and pounded upstairs to our father’s study.\n\n“Daddy, Daddy!” she cried out in anguish. “Margaret Mumm says there’s no Santa Claus!”\n\nOur father stopped typing, considered briefly what she’d told him, and then said, “You tell Margaret Mumm there’s no God.”\n\nExplore the January 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nIn the Berkeley Hills, long, public staircases run between streets like steep sidewalks, and the minister and his family lived in a house built next to one of them. So, not long after Ellen ran off, as my father looked through the window above his desk, he saw the man approach like an advancing filmstrip: first the shiny black shoes, then the black pant legs, and soon enough the whole of him, making his way to the bottom step and crossing the street.\n\nIn America in the ’60s, members of the clergy were generally considered moral authorities and accorded a certain measure of respect. But this particular clergyman was placing a very bad bet if he thought he could pay a visit to Tom Flanagan and tell him the right way to talk to his children about God.\n\nAfter the inevitable knock at the door, my father descended the stairs, and then there it was: American Mainline Protestantism face-to-face with post-Hiroshima rational thought. The minister must have assumed that Tom would at the very least invite him in, but he didn’t, so the man was forced to stand on the front porch and reduce his plaint to its elements.\n\n“Your daughter told my daughter that there is no God,” he said, more in sorrow than in anger. I think it was meant to be a pastoral visit.\n\n“And your daughter told my daughter that there is no Santa Claus,” my father replied.\n\n“But—there is no Santa Claus!” the minister sputtered.\n\n“And there is no God.”\n\nWe didn’t have any notion of God in our house, but we certainly had Christmas, and with it revealed truth: the carrots on the front porch, eaten down to stumps! The presents piled under the tree, with our names on them! Our cosmology was just as considered as his.\n\nUntil all of this certainty was challenged.\n\nTen years later, Ellen and I were called down to the living room of a rented house in Dublin, where we were spending one of our father’s endless sabbatical years (I went to first, fifth, and tenth grade in Ireland), and tersely informed that we were going to be baptized.\n\nWe shrieked in horror. If our parents had told us they were getting divorced, we would have taken the news with equanimity. We would have said, “Hey, you gave it your best shot,” and recommended that they wait until we got back to California, where theocracy would not impede their plans. But religion? There was no explanation for it; they certainly didn’t say they’d had their own conversions.\n\nEllen spoke for us both: “I’m not doing it!”\n\nI echoed her: “No way!”\n\nOur parents were up to something, and clearly our mother, Jean, was the instigator. Tom would much later confess that the whole thing was a hypocritical plan that my mother had hatched to get us into Catholic schools (which were like private schools, but cheap) when we returned to Berkeley.\n\nJean was unmoved by our yelps of disgust and fear. We were to be whipped through the tenets of the faith via weekly lessons delivered at a convent school by two nuns (one for Ellen, and one for me), and the event would occur early one evening in December, in time for a drinks party afterward. The guests would be 25 of my parents’ friends. Would we like to invite any of our own friends? We would rather be buried alive.\n\nThe first lesson was the next day, and I began my session with tea in a cup and saucer—very civilized—and biscuits. But no sooner had I eaten the last Jaffa Cake on the plate than we turned to Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride: the virgin birth (“What’s a virgin?” “It’s a girl who hasn’t even met a boy”); the Crucifixion (holy shit!); original sin; confession; the Eucharist; priests’ ability to transform ordinary bread and wine into literal (this was very, very important to understand: not symbolic—literal) human blood and flesh, a tiny bit of which we would be consuming once a week for the rest of our lives.\n\nYou can’t jump people into Roman Catholicism after the age of reason; they have to “come to God” on their own, or be in some kind of trouble. We didn’t believe any of it, and not just because of what our parents had always told us. It didn’t sound plausible. We lay in our beds at night and fumed. At the baptism, Ellen and I would have to have water poured on our long hair, like a couple of idiots. We would have to say something about believing in God, and we would have to reject the devil and all his pomps. (Pomps : shows of magnificence, splendor. Enough said! Rejected!) We took our final lesson, and a rehearsal was staged. Someone made a fruitcake with marzipan icing. In Ireland, when a woman makes a fruitcake, there’s no turning back. We were fucked.\n\nBut then—like a dream, like a magic fish bone—word arrived from Belfast that Seamus and Marie Heaney were coming down for the event, and that Seamus would write a poem. That changed everything for me. Anything the Heaneys were cool with, I was cool with. They were my idea of what a dazzling couple ought to be, and they were always, always kind to us, and we needed kindness.\n\nWhen Seamus stood up and read the poem, “Baptism: for Ellen and Kate Flanagan,” I accepted everything—all of it, all at once: poetry, God, and myself.\n\nFor half a century, I’ve kept the piece of onionskin he typed that poem on, so thin that it’s almost translucent. It’s a blessing on the long, strange project of being Kate Flanagan. That winter night in Dublin, Seamus gave me the one thing I desperately needed growing up in that crazy family: my certificate of belonging, in this world and the next.\n\nPhoto-illustration by Sarah Palmer. Source: Courtesy of Caitlin Flanagan\n\nWe first met the Heaneys the year before the baptism, in 1970, when I was 9 years old. Seamus, Marie, and their two little boys, Michael and Christopher, had come to California so that Seamus could spend the academic year in the UC Berkeley English department. (Their daughter, Catherine Ann, was still circling in the future, choosing her moment.) My parents were almost 20 years older than the Heaneys, my father a professor in the department, and they took the family under their wing as they did for many visiting professors—Jean in her motherly way, and Tom with his incredible erudition and merciless, legendary wit.\n\n“Berkeley swings like a swing-boat, has all the colour of the fairground and as much incense burning as a high altar in the Vatican,” Seamus wrote to his editor, Rosemary Goad, shortly after arriving. That wonderful description spent 50 years in a folder, but now—on the tenth anniversary of his death—has been published in the collected Letters of Seamus Heaney, edited by the poet Christopher Reid. Of course I’ve read and loved Seamus’s poetry most of my life, but the way I actually knew him was in person, talking with people. Every joke, kind word, and cynical quip expressed in the letters—many of which mentioned or were addressed to my father—made me feel that he was in a room just beyond the one where I sat reading.\n\nRead: James Parker on the letters of Seamus Heaney\n\nOne Heaney is fun. All of the Heaneys together are the best time you’ll ever have. Marie is smart and beautiful and funny, and the boys, then 4 and 2, were incredible, with their Northern Irish accents, their serious first names (in America, they’d have been Mike—even Mikey—and Chris), and their fealty to each other. While Ellen was grinding it out in ninth grade—expectations were higher for her, owing to birth order and the obvious fact that she was giving education much more to work with—my mother was blessedly eccentric about my own school attendance. I would report mild health problems and head out with Jean and Marie and the boys on field trips to the pumpkin patches in Half Moon Bay, my mother fearlessly navigating our Plymouth Valiant up and down San Francisco blocks so steep that you would feel the front tires inching across the asphalt until suddenly the center of gravity shifted, physics took over, and for 30 seconds, your fate was anyone’s guess.\n\nThe family wasn’t in Berkeley long before Heaneymania broke out. Berkeley in those days was an archipelago of dinner parties, and my parents were no pikers. There were many mornings when I’d go downstairs to watch cartoons and find Seamus asleep on the couch—he would have driven Marie home to relieve the babysitter and come back so he and Tom could talk and talk, cracking each other up and also taking part in what Seamus would later call the beginning of an ongoing tutorial. If you wanted to discuss Irish history and literature, Tom Flanagan was your man.\n\nFrom the February 1988 issue: Seamus Heaney on Oscar Wilde\n\nImagine being liberated from Belfast in 1970—when the violence and terror of the Troubles ran in parallel with the most narrowly defined social conventions, policed every hour of the day and night by neighbors, teachers, priests, and ministers—for a year in Berkeley! The contrast was as stark as any between two Western cities could possibly be. This wasn’t London, where King’s Road offered velvet pants, joss sticks, and a friendly attitude toward sex between strangers as a thriving, but still circumscribed, performance. This was a citywide retreat from the known social order, with a California twist.\n\nEarly mornings, Seamus would sometimes drive the family across the bay to Sam’s, in Tiburon, for pancakes and champagne, getting home in time to teach his 9 a.m. class. Their first weekend in town, the family went to a Pete Seeger concert. At parties he met the great California poets—Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Gary Snyder. He and Leonard Michaels became friends. His one regret when they arrived was that he’d gotten his hair cut before leaving Ireland.\n\n“It’s lotus land for the moment,” he wrote to friends—a perfect Seamus sentence, suggesting both his ease with the sensual experience of California and his sly, characteristic caution: for the moment. All too soon, from my perspective, the year ended, and the Heaneys packed up their flat, said goodbye to champagne and pancakes, and headed home to Belfast. As Seamus would say, “Back to porridge and gunfire.”\n\nTom and Caitlin Flanagan in Dublin (Sarah Palmer; Source: Courtesy of Caitlin Flanagan)\n\nWe Flanagans wouldn’t be far behind the Heaneys, because my father’s sabbatical year was upon us. Once Ellen and I had re-enrolled at our Dublin school and settled back into our Irish life, we drove north to spend a week with the Heaneys in Belfast.\n\nOf course I knew about the Troubles, but I’d never seen a militarized border before. Tom warned us to be quiet while an officer took our passports and inspected the trunk of the Morris Mini for weapons. Our mother was at the wheel because Tom refused to learn to drive a car, while Ellen and I sat in the back seat, staring out anxiously from beneath a welter of books and the glinting gold wrappers of a dozen Cadbury Milks. A few soldiers (“They’re so young,” my mother said) watched us in a wary and—in the manner of all soldiers on shit deployments—contemptuous way. The mystified officer who waved us through seemed to figure that we were creatures of extreme naivete who would be dealt with, one way or another, once we were in Belfast.\n\nThe country roads were beautiful, but terrible things happened on them. For two decades, the most frightening sound in the north was the screech of brakes preceding a bomb being thrown through the doors of a dance hall or pub. The “proxy bomb” was created during the conflict, such a well-designed instrument of terror that it was later deployed as far away as Colombia and Syria. Gunmen stop a driver on a country road and force him to get into the driver’s seat of a waiting car that has been loaded with a bomb. He will drive that car into whatever target he’s told. The gunmen’s leverage is absolute: They have the man’s family at gunpoint back at the farm—perhaps they will remind him of what the children were wearing that morning.\n\nI remember that Seamus was haunted by an incident in which a van full of workers was stopped by masked men, who demanded that everyone get out and stand in a line. The Catholics were ordered to come forward. In fact, only one of the men was Catholic. The man next to him secretly took his hand and pressed it: Don’t do it; we’ll cover for you. But for whatever reason, habit or loyalty, he stepped forward—and all of the others were swiftly machine-gunned. The ambushers were Catholics.\n\nLeft: Seamus Heaney, the literary critic F. W. Dupee, and Tom in California in 1974. Right: Caitlin with Seamus in California in 1974. (Sarah Palmer; Source: Courtesy of Caitlin Flanagan)\n\nIn Berkeley, one of Seamus’s Black friends once asked him to explain what was happening in the north of Ireland, and when he’d finished a brief accounting, his friend said, “I don’t know the words, but I sure recognize the tune.” It was the old thing, the thing that people do to one another. And as the violence continued, the threads holding the tapestry together started to snap.\n\nBelfast frightened me, but once we got to 16 Ashley Avenue, nothing bad could happen. It was like a family reunion. Ellen and I watched The Magic Roundabout with the boys, and every night at dusk, Seamus and the other men on the street would unroll concertina wire at the ends of the block.\n\nOne evening, the adults were planning to go to a party while Ellen and I watched the boys—the babysitter had backed out. Ellen was extremely beautiful and getting more so by the month. My parents didn’t seem to care that their teenage daughter was stuck at home, fed a constant diet of Seán Ó Riada and the Irish rebellion of 1798, but Marie did. Other young people would be at this party, and Marie many times said it was a shame that Ellen couldn’t go too. I was determined to save the night, and I insisted that I would be the babysitter. Everyone thought it was a weird idea—no one more so than the little boys—but I’m an adamant person. Marie told me that I could call her at the smallest hint of trouble.\n\nEveryone left, the boys got into their pajamas, and we hit the Richard Scarry pretty hard. Soon they were asleep. I felt amazing and useful and like a teenager myself. But after about an hour, I started hearing noises—muffled booms, shouting. Perhaps they were the sounds of any normal city at night, but Belfast in 1972 wasn’t a normal city. I looked in on the little boys, and realized I had taken on more than I could handle. What in the world was I going to do if I had to get them out? In defeat, I called Marie, and she came home. All the rest of my life, I’ve regretted doing it. I could have been the hero; I could have been the Ellen!\n\nBecause what was happening in the north was so violent, because it was unfolding in an English-speaking country, because it could be read as an ethnic minority’s final fight against empire, and—perhaps most important—because it involved Ireland, a country from which millions of Americans claimed ancestry, the Troubles quickly became not just a European story but a global one. And because the six counties of the north were filled with children going to school, women shopping, farmers walking cows down tiny lanes to be milked, and young people’s dances and secret spaces, they produced a river of blood.\n\nWhat did people want from Seamus Heaney at that time? Everything. There was tremendous pressure for him to turn his poetry into a form of opinion writing and take moral command of the situation. He would never have done anything like that. He was a poet, not an on-call political-versification machine. More than that, he understood that what was happening didn’t fit into a neat rubric of oppression and colonial rule. This was a 14-year-old headed to band practice who was abducted, hooded, and murdered. This was an 11-year-old on her way to school when a bomb exploded in her father’s car. This wasn’t an academic debate about the Stormont government or the British army’s casual use of rubber bullets. This was hell.\n\nFrom the July/August 2020 issue: Seamus Heaney’s journey into darkness\n\nSeamus in the early ’70s had become very interested in the bodies that had been discovered in the bogs that stretch across Northern Europe. This type of bog has the perfect conditions to preserve bodies for thousands of years. The majority of those that have been found were Iron Age people, and despite their wide geographic distribution, they tend to have commonalities: A great number were naked, except for perhaps a ceremonial piece of clothing or jewelry; their stomachs were filled with a gruel of local grains; and many had been murdered. Some had been staked into the bog with wooden pegs, as though to protect them from theft or interference, or even to offer them as a sort of display.\n\nIn 1950, an archaeologist named P. V. Glob, who was employed by a museum in Aarhus, Denmark, oversaw the removal of a body from the village of Tollund—the astonishingly well-preserved corpse of a man killed more than 2,000 years earlier. Glob wrote a book about that find and several others, and he gave it a riveting title: not The Bog Bodies, but The Bog People. Who were they? What did they tell us of their beliefs and their cultures?\n\nSeamus knew bogs well; he’d cut turf on the family farm in County Derry. And he knew the things that had been pulled out of bogs: the skeletons of giant Irish elk, long extinct; clay jars still filled with butter. The Bog People inspired him. Soon after his return from Berkeley, he published “The Tollund Man,” a terrifying abduction of a poem that casually welcomes you on a short journey before grabbing hold of you and taking you right down to the underworld.\n\n“Some day I will go to Aarhus,” the poem begins, like an epic:\n\nTo see his peat-brown head,\n\nThe mild pods of his eye-lids,\n\nHis pointed skin cap.\n\nAlready the poem is turning, taking you to the place in the bog “where they dug him out,” wanting to see the “gruel of winter seeds / caked in his stomach.” We are in the territory of Robert Graves and the White Goddess:\n\nI could risk blasphemy,\n\nConsecrate the cauldron bog\n\nOur holy ground and pray\n\nHim to make germinate\n\n\n\nThe scattered, ambushed\n\nFlesh of labourers\n\nLaborers, brothers, children, old men—the ambushed dead; the missing; the disappeared.\n\nWe’re in the underworld now, chthonic and mad, as the townspeople point at the Tollund Man while he is raced in a cart to his murder. How was he chosen? How is anyone chosen?\n\nThe famous last stanza of the poem is the answer to the question people didn’t even know how to pose about the river of blood.\n\nOut there in Jutland\n\nIn the old man-killing parishes\n\nI will feel lost,\n\nUnhappy and at home.\n\nSeamus often compared his bond with Tom to the one between father and son. “I suppose you’re destined to be a father-figure of sorts to me,” he wrote to Tom in 1974. “Blooming awful.”\n\nSeamus had a father, of course, the farmer and cattle dealer Patrick Heaney. But Tom was his “literary foster father.” In the year that Seamus arrived in California, he later told an interviewer, his “head was still basically wired up to English Literature terminals.” It was Tom, he said, who gave him a “far more charged-up sense of Yeats and Joyce” and the “whole Irish consequence.”\n\nFrom the November 1997 issue: Seamus Heaney on W. B. Yeats, “All Ireland’s Bard”\n\nSeamus was a poet in a country known for them. My father often said that Seamus came early into a sense not merely of his talent, but also of the obligations that went along with it. But he didn’t necessarily want to be a poet of the madness unfolding in the north. Of the Tollund Man he later said: “Even if there had been no Northern Troubles, no mankilling in the parishes, I would still have felt at home with that ‘peat-brown head’—an utterly familiar countryman’s face.”\n\nEven as a global figure, Seamus never stopped being grateful to Tom for playing what he saw as an essential role in his development as an artist. In the collection of letters, I came across one he’d written to a friend soon after Seamus had accepted the Nobel Prize in Stockholm. He and Marie were in New York, where they’d driven the two hours to my parents’ house on Long Island—“a chance to see Tom and Jean Flanagan and sit with them in gratitude and sage memory, friendship and wonder at what can happen to a youth from the fields.”\n\nLeft: Seamus reading in New York. Right: Seamus, Tom, and Caitlin on Long Island in the early 1980s. (Sarah Palmer; Source: Courtesy of Caitlin Flanagan)\n\nAs the years went on, Seamus quietly took care of all kinds of needs that Tom had. One year we lived in Ireland in a rental house that had the basics, including a set of cheaply made but brand-new furniture. What it didn’t have was a bookcase. Tom was working on a novel, and his office looked like a graduate student’s squat until Seamus showed up with wood and nails and stain, and built my father a bookcase.\n\nNear the end of Tom’s life, when he was becoming frail, my parents bought another house in the Berkeley Hills, and Seamus came out to see it. My father was anxious to show him the impressive study, which ran the length of the house in a gabled attic. It was a magnificent space but had a very steep staircase, and the second Seamus saw it, he said my parents had to get a banister put in.\n\nMy mother (a former nurse and essentially the breathing apparatus of one Tom Flanagan) had of course been saying that since the day they moved in, and my father (pretty much the hair shirt of one Jean Flanagan) had ignored her. Each time she raised it anew he would say, “Banister, banister, awk, awk,” like she was a parrot in a cage. (I’m telling you, this was one of the world’s great marriages crammed with enough nuclear-level rage to split the world apart like two plates.) But when Seamus said “banister,” my father got the banister.\n\nI used to think that my father was my ace in the hole. He had the same handwriting as Santa Claus, who was, of course, God. He was at absolute ease in any group of great thinkers and writers, and because of him, I grew up around many remarkable people. Sometimes when we were talking, he would say, “That’s a good point,” or even “That’s a very good point.” He never said it to jolly me along; he said it when I’d made a good point. To this day, if you were to observe me thinking—while gardening or cooking or waiting in the TSA line—you might hear me mutter, “That’s a very good point,” and at first opportunity, I’ll go write it down.\n\nWhy would a girl with such a wonderful father ever need a second one? Because someone must have dropped Tom on his head as a baby. A streak of cruelty ran through him that could be channeled into incredibly destructive behavior, sometimes directed at himself, more often at the three people he loved most: my mother, my sister, and me.\n\nIf you had caught up with me 20 years ago, or even 10, I would have showered you with shocking tales. But something happens when you turn 60. You just let go. You finally realize there isn’t ever going to be a reward for thinking about something and talking about it. And you realize (terrible truth though it may be) that, as Philip Larkin—of all people!—reports, “what will survive of us is love.”\n\nOne of the many things I inherited after my father’s death was Seamus’s loyalty. My parents died within a year of each other. Hardly a tragedy: I was almost 40! But who has ever been closer to their difficult parents? My position in the family was that of a suitcase to the traveler. Half of the time it’s an unholy burden, but when you see it thundering back down the luggage chute, you could weep with relief. I was deeply loved, and I was never left behind.\n\nSix months after Tom died, I was suddenly diagnosed with aggressive and life-threatening breast cancer. I felt a strong need to keep the information contained to as small a group as possible. I thought it would hurt my career if people knew I was that sick, and also, in a primitive way, I thought that the fewer people who knew about it, the better the chance it wasn’t real. But somehow Seamus found out.\n\nSeamus didn’t believe in a force as mere as optimism. He believed in something far greater and more powerful: hope.\n\nSo many of Seamus’s letters in the collection begin in apology—over and over again, he makes amends for being so egregiously late in responding to someone. And yet, not 10 days after the diagnosis, a letter arrived from Seamus and Marie. They were aghast at the completely “arbitrary insult upon health and beauty.” Soon after, another letter: He’d heard I’d come through surgery, “as valiantly and gracefully as the great spirit you are and have been.” They would be in St. Lucia for 10 days—probably to visit their friend, the poet Derek Walcott—and he told me how to reach them if I needed them.\n\nEveryone who knew Seamus has a story like that. He had a sense of obligation to others that in anyone else would be incapacitating. Once, when my own children were small, I took them to visit Seamus and Marie. After tea and hugs, we climbed into the taxi, and the driver said, “So you’ve been to see the great man.” Almost around the corner was a billboard with his picture on it, promoting a new documentary. By his later years, there was no escaping himself, and the endless duties the role entailed. He may have fantasized about ditching those duties, but he never shirked them.\n\nThe letters helped; the poems too. After I first got sick, and in the years since, I have returned often to some of his most famous lines, from The Cure at Troy, which argues for faith in an unseen future. Seamus didn’t believe in a force as mere as optimism. He believed in something far greater and more powerful: hope.\n\nSo hope for a great sea-change\n\nOn the far side of revenge.\n\nBelieve that a further shore\n\n\n\nIs reachable from here.\n\nBelieve in miracles\n\nAnd cures and healing wells.\n\nIt was because of those lines that I started ignoring the oncologists who insisted that I would never be cured.\n\nWhen a public person dies as suddenly and shockingly as Seamus did—on an ordinary August morning in 2013, in a hospital corridor on his way to surgery—before the family has an hour to confront the unthinkable, the news flies out the window and circles the world. It was an international story, of course, but in Ireland, the grief was personal, intense, self-reflective.\n\nWhatever it means to be Irish—whatever qualities of heart and mind, whatever generosity and love for the very earth and rocks of that island—millions of Irish people were convinced that Seamus Heaney embodied it. All over Ireland, the grief was not just for a storied Irishman and a great poet. The grief was for a friend.\n\nRead: Seamus Heaney’s plainspoken power\n\nTwo days after he died was the All-Ireland football semifinal. Dublin versus Kerry, no kidding around, and 80,000 people packed into Croke Park. Before the match, a photo of Seamus appeared on two giant screens, and almost unthinkingly, as though rising for “The Soldier’s Song,” everyone in that stadium stood up. The announcer said: “We’d like to mark the passing of one of our greatest literary icons, the Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney.” And with that, the entire crowd began clapping. The announcer said that in addition to his great works and awards, Seamus had played underage football for Castledawson in Derry. The weight given to that last fact was the same as to the first ones. It meant: He was one of us. Among the sacks of letters to The Irish Times was one written by a man called Frank Munnelly: “As a nation we are a man down.”\n\nThe funeral was in Dublin, and the burial was in Bellaghy, and the roads were lined with people. Seamus had read his poetry around the world, and been welcomed everywhere, but he never had any doubt about where the journey would end: in the graveyard of his parish church. “We are welcoming Seamus home,” said the parish priest, while 2,000 mourners strained to hear him. The family was there, of course: those children of the father who had never once failed them and had only and always loved them, and, in the center of everything, always—Marie. Michael (now Mick) spoke briefly, informing the world of Seamus’s last words—a text to Marie that read, “Noli timere”: Don’t be afraid.\n\nMy parents don’t have graves. We were a very anti-death family. They had both suffered devastating losses when they were children, and so they tried to keep the very notion of death a secret from us for as long as possible. When Ellen texted me, “Have you heard about Seamus?,” I knew it could mean only one thing. But for a minute or so I stopped myself from Googling his name. I was giving reality a chance to sort itself out. My rational self reported that if he was dead, then there would someday be a grave and a gravestone, and I instantly decided that if that was true, I would never go see them. It would be an acceptance of a fact I was fighting against.\n\nRead: How so many people got Seamus Heaney’s last words wrong\n\nBut a few months ago, a full decade after he died, I went at last to Bellaghy. My husband took me—“Stalwart Rob,” as my father described him in his last letter to Seamus—and we sailed over the “invisible border,” as it’s now called. There’s no more signage than there is crossing a state line in America—in fact, none at all.\n\nThe sky was darkening because we were late; we’d been having lunch with Marie and Mick in Dublin and hadn’t wanted to leave. We arrived at St. Mary’s church under a spitting rain that would suddenly let up, in bursts of revelation and transfiguration, as Irish rains do. Halfway down the graveyard, dark marble austere against the hard gray of the church wall, the headstone seemed almost to hover a few inches off the earth because of the famous line carved into it: “Walk on air against your better judgement.”\n\nIt’s from a poem, “The Gravel Walks,” and it gives you the ability, the permission, to hold the full, complicated equation of life lightly. I repeat it often. I’ve been sick for many years now, and whenever I get a call that explains some bad finding, I listen stoically and then remind myself that I’ll walk on air despite the news.\n\nThe words are for the world—ours and that of future generations—but most of all, I imagine them as a private communication to Marie. The point of the entire operation was always Marie, the quarry turned way of life.\n\nI’d bought three pots of violets at SPAR market, in the village, and I put the flowers next to the gravestone, feeling a bit sheepish, as though I was performing something I’d learned from the movies, or television, though Seamus—and Tom, come to think of it—would have approved of SPAR market. It was the right way to go about it.\n\nI was inclined to stay there forever; why else had I come? But it was getting cold, and Rob gently kicked at some of the gravel in the path between graves.\n\n“The kingdom of gravel was inside you,” the poem says. “Hoard and praise the verity of gravel. / Gems for the undeluded. Milt of earth.” And yet that’s the poem that ends in air, with the gentle counsel to establish yourself “somewhere in between” the earth and heaven, the gravel and a song.\n\nThen, just past where Rob was standing, I saw a much older headstone, weathered, but its letters clearly read HEANEY. And, in smaller print, beneath:\n\nErected by Patrick Heaney\n\nIn Memory of his son Christopher\n\nDied 25th Feb. 1953 Aged three years.\n\nIt jolted me in a way Seamus’s grave hadn’t. Christopher was Seamus’s little brother, who ran into the road and was struck by a car and killed. “Mid-Term Break”—one of the first poems people read when they discover Seamus’s work—is about Seamus receiving the news at 14, when he was away at boarding school, and then coming home.\n\nIn the porch I met my father crying—\n\nHe had always taken funerals in his stride—\n\nSeamus hated crying—“blubbering”—and I always wondered if this terrible scene was a reason for that.\n\nThe baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pram\n\nWhen I came in, and I was embarrassed\n\nBy old men standing up to shake my hand\n\nA child dead, and a sudden manhood foisted upon Seamus. His early poems are so familiar to me that the events they record can seem like the ones in fiction, the responses of the speaker those of a fictional character. But there was Christopher’s grave, just as real as his brother’s, just as much a marker of a human life.\n\nI’ve been a Catholic since my baptism, but the only Catholic tradition I remember my father handing down to me was lighting a candle “for the dead of the family.” Catholicism provides you with something no rational approach to the world ever will: a cosmology of intercessors, saints. It’s a religion that acknowledges, openly and from the very beginning, that faith itself is a mystery. Walking out of that graveyard left me with a bleakness, but I didn’t have time to confront it, because I was already entering the church so that I could light a candle for the dead of my family.\n\nWe can’t escape it: losing the people we love and need the most. Each death has to be countenanced as a fact, squared away in the record books. But there are people so well known to us, so loved, that death is one more thing that can be turned to air.\n\nSeamus Heaney photographed at the Royal Society of Literature in London, March 16, 1995 (Steve Pyke / Getty)\n\nWhen Tom died, Seamus wrote an obituary for him in The New York Review of Books : “Since our first meeting in 1970, he was like a father to me and like a typical Irish son I felt closest at our times of greatest silence and remoteness.” He described a few of their endless car trips and excursions; only Tom and Seamus would scramble down a cliff path in Antrim to see the site where Roger Casement had wanted to be buried. Let no stone be unturned, no vigil unattended. And then Seamus quoted the poem he’d written at the time of his own father’s death:\n\nAnd there was nothing between us there\n\nThat might not still be happily ever after.\n\nThis article appears in the January 2025 print edition with the headline “Walk on Air Against Your Better Judgment.”",

Sign up for it here.\n\nIn January, when the historian Avi Shilon returned to Columbia University from winter break, a thought coursed through his mind: If calm can take hold in Gaza, then perhaps it could also happen in Morningside Heights. Just a few days earlier, in time for the start of the semester, Hamas and Israel had brokered a cease-fire in their war.\n\nOver the many months of that war, Columbia was the site of some of America’s most vitriolic protests against Israel’s actions, and even its existence. For two weeks last spring, an encampment erected by anti-Israel demonstrators swallowed the fields in the center of the compact Manhattan campus. Nobody could enter Butler Library without hearing slogans such as “Globalize the intifada!” and “We don’t want no Zionists here!” and “Burn Tel Aviv to the ground!” At the end of April, students, joined by sympathizers from outside the university gates, stormed Hamilton Hall—which houses the undergraduate-college deans’ offices—and then battled police when they sought to clear the building. Because of the threat of spiraling chaos, the university canceled its main commencement ceremony in May.\n\nShilon felt that the tamping of hostilities in Gaza made the moment ripe for the course he was scheduled to teach, “History of Modern Israel,” which would examine the competing Jewish and Palestinian narratives about his native country’s founding.\n\nBut Columbia soon disabused him of his hopes. About 30 minutes into the first session of his seminar, four people, their faces shrouded in keffiyehs, burst into his classroom. A protester circled the seminar table, flinging flyers in front of Shilon’s students. One flyer bore an image of a boot stomping on a Star of David; another stated, The Enemy Will Not See Tomorrow.\n\nIn the Israeli universities where Shilon had studied and taught, he was accustomed to strident critiques of the country. Sometimes he even found himself sympathizing with them. Taking up difficult arguments struck him as the way to navigate tense disagreements, so he rose from his chair and gingerly approached the protesters. “You’re invited to learn,” he told them.\n\nBut the protesters ignored him. As one held up a camera to film, another stared at it and delivered a monologue in which she described Shilon’s class—which had barely progressed beyond a discussion of expectations for the semester—as an example of “Columbia University’s normalization of genocide.”\n\nAfter she finished her speech, the demonstrators left the room, but a sense of intrusion lingered. Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the umbrella group that organized protests on campus, posted a video of the action, with the caption: “We disrupted a zionist class, and you should too.” The university later offered to provide security for Shilon’s class because it couldn’t be sure if CUAD was bluffing.\n\nOver the past two years, Columbia’s institutional life has become more and more absurd. Confronted with a war on the other side of the world, the course of which the university has zero capacity to affect, a broad swath of the community acted as if the school’s trustees and administrators could determine the fate of innocent families in Gaza. To force the university into acceding to demands—ending study abroad in Israel, severing a partnership with Tel Aviv University, divesting from companies with holdings in Israel––protesters attempted to shut down campus activity. For the sake of entirely symbolic victories, they were willing to risk their academic careers and even arrest.\n\nBecause the protesters treated the war as a local issue, they trained their anger on Jewish and Israeli students and faculty, including Shilon, some of whom have been accused of complicity with genocide on the basis of their religious affiliation or national origin. More than any other American university, Columbia experienced a breakdown in the fabric of its community that demanded a firm response from administrators—but these administrators tended to choke on their own fears.\n\nMany of the protesters followed university rules governing demonstrations and free expression. Many others did not. Liberal administrators couldn’t or wouldn’t curb the illiberalism in their midst. By failing to discipline protesters who transgressed university rules, they signaled that disrupting classrooms carried no price. By tolerating professors who bullied students who disagreed with them, they signaled that incivility and even harassment were acceptable forms of discourse.\n\nIt was as if Columbia was reliving the bedlam of 1968, which included a student takeover of the university and scarred the institution for decades. And just like in the Vietnam era, the university became a ripe target for demagogues on the right, who are eager to demolish the prestige of elite higher education. And now that Donald Trump and his allies control the federal government, they have used anti-Semitism as a pretext for damaging an institution that they abhor. In the name of rescuing the Jews of Columbia, the Trump administration cut off $400 million in federal contracts and grants to the university. Trump officials then sent a letter demanding—as preconditions for restoring the funds—a series of immediate, far-reaching steps, including suspending and expelling Hamilton Hall protesters, producing a plan to overhaul admissions, and putting the school’s Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies under “academic receivership.”\n\nMark Rudd, president of Students for a Democratic Society, addresses students at Columbia University in May 1968. (Hulton Archive / Getty)\n\nAnd in an attempt to suppress political views it dislikes, the administration authorized the unlawful detention of Mahmoud Khalil, an alumnus who helped organize campus protests, and sent federal agents to search two dorm rooms. Another graduate student, targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, fled to Canada rather than risk apprehension. The Trump administration’s war on Columbia stands to wreck research, further inflame tensions on campus, and destroy careers—including, in a supreme irony, those of many Jewish academics, scientists, physicians, and graduate students whom the administration ostensibly wants to protect.\n\nTrump’s autocratic presence unbalances every debate. But just because his administration is exploiting the issue of anti-Semitism does not mean that anti-Jewish activism is not an issue at Columbia. Somewhere along the way, one of the nation’s greatest universities lost its capacity to conduct intellectual arguments over contentious issues without resorting to hyperbole and accusations of moral deficiency.\n\nOn Israel, the issue that most sharply divides Columbia, such accusations took a sinister cast. Jewish students faced ostracism and bullying that, if experienced by any other group of students on campus, would be universally regarded as unacceptable. It was a crisis that became painfully evident in the course of the war over Gaza, but it didn’t begin with the war, and it won’t end with it.\n\nThe story of American Jewry can be told, in part, by the history of Columbia’s admissions policy. At the turn of the 20th century, when entry required merely passing an exam, the sons of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe began rushing into the institution. By 1920, Columbia was likely 40 percent Jewish. This posed a marketing problem for the school, as the children of New York’s old Knickerbocker elite began searching out corners of the Ivy League with fewer Brooklyn accents.\n\nTo restore Anglo-Saxon Protestant demographic dominance, university president Nicholas Murray Butler invented the modern college-application process, in which concepts such as geographic diversity and a well-rounded student body became pretexts to weed out studious Jews from New York City. In 1921, Columbia became the first private college to impose a quota limiting the number of Jews. (In the ’30s, Columbia rejected Richard Feynman, who later won a Nobel Prize in physics, and Isaac Asimov, the great science fiction writer.) Columbia, however, was intent on making money off the Jews it turned away, so to educate them, it created Seth Low Junior College in Brooklyn, a second-rate version of the Manhattan institution.\n\nOnly after World War II, when America fought a war against Nazism, did this exclusionary system wither away. When I attended Columbia for four blissful years, a generation or so ago, the school was a Jewish wonderland, where I first encountered the pluralism of American Jewish life. I became friends with red-diaper babies, kids raised in Jewish socialist families. I dated an Orthodox woman who had converted from evangelical Christianity. Several floors of my dorm had been nicknamed Anatevka, after the shtetl in Fiddler on the Roof; they had kosher kitchens, and on the Sabbath, the elevators would automatically stop on each of those floors. I studied Yiddish with a doyenne of the dying Yiddish theater and attended lectures with Yosef Yerushalmi, one of the great Jewish historians of his generation. At Columbia, for the first time in my life, I felt completely at home in my identity.\n\nI also imbibed the university’s protest culture: I briefly helped take over Hamilton Hall in the name of preserving the Audubon Ballroom, the Upper Manhattan site of Malcolm X’s assassination. Columbia wanted to convert the building into a research center. The leader of our movement, Benjamin Jealous, who went on to head the NAACP, was suspended for his role; I was put on probation.\n\nNostalgia, however, is a distorting filter. Long before the October 7 attack by Hamas on southern Israel that sparked the subsequent invasion of Gaza, there were accusations of anti-Semitism on campus. I tended to wish them away, but after the Hamas attack, the evidence kept walloping me.\n\nAlthough protests against Israel erupted on many campuses after October 7, the collision between Zionists and anti-Zionists was especially virulent at Columbia. Less than a week after the attack, a woman was arrested in front of the library for allegedly beating an Israeli student who was hanging posters of hostages held in Gaza. (The Manhattan district attorney found that the woman hadn’t intentionally hit the student and dismissed the case after she apologized and agreed to counseling.)\n\nSoon after the war in Gaza began, the Columbia Daily Spectator interviewed more than 50 Jewish students about their experiences: 13 told the student newspaper that they had been attacked or harassed; 12 admitted that they had obscured markers of their Jewish identity, tucking away Star of David necklaces and hiding kippahs under caps to avoid provoking the ire of fellow students.\n\nTo Columbia’s misfortune, the university had a new president, Minouche Shafik, who’d arrived by way of the London School of Economics. Any leader would have been overwhelmed by the explosion of passions, but she seemed especially shell-shocked by the rancor—and how it attracted media, activists, and politicians, all exploiting the controversy for their own purposes. Panicked leaders, without any clear sense of their own direction, have a rote response: They appoint a task force. And in November 2023, Shafik appointed some of Columbia’s most eminent academics to assess the school’s anti-Semitism problem. (Shafik had hoped to have a parallel task force on Islamophobia, but Rashid Khalidi, a Columbia historian and the most prominent Palestinian scholar in the country, called the idea a “fig leaf to pretend that they are ‘balanced,’” and the idea never hatched.)\n\nIn “listening sessions” with students, task-force members heard one recurring complaint: that administrators were strangely indifferent to Jewish students complaining about abuse. Rather than investigating incidents, some administrators steered Jewish students to mental-health counseling, as if they needed therapy to toughen them up. Students who had filed official reports of bias with the university claimed that they’d never heard back. (To protect the privacy of listening-session participants, the task force never confirmed specific instances, but it deemed the complaints credible.)\n\nPerhaps, early on, one could imagine benign explanations for the weak response. But in June, as the task force went about its investigation, The Washington Free Beacon reported on a series of text messages fired off by four Columbia deans as they attended a panel on Jewish life at Columbia. (A panel attendee who had sat behind one of the administrators had surreptitiously photographed the text thread over her shoulder.) Instead of sympathetically listening to panelists discuss anti-Semitism, the deans unwittingly confirmed the depth of the problem. These officials, whose role gave them responsibility for student safety, snarkily circulated accusations about the pernicious influence of Jewish power. “Amazing what $$$ can do,” one of the deans wrote. Another accused the head of campus Hillel of playing up complaints for the sake of fundraising. “Comes from such a place of privilege,” one of them moaned. After the Free Beacon published the screenshots, Columbia suspended three of the administrators. Not long after, they resigned.\n\nA month later, at the beginning of the academic year, the task force published a damning depiction of quotidian student life. An especially powerful section of the report described the influence of Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the organizer of the anti-Israel protests. CUAD was a coalition of 116 tuition-supported, faculty-advised student groups, including the university mariachi band and the Barnard Garden Club.\n\nCUAD doesn’t simply oppose war and occupation; it endorses violence as the pathway to its definition of liberation. A year ago, a Columbia student activist told an audience watching him on Instagram, “Be grateful that I’m not just going out and murdering Zionists.” At first, CUAD dissociated itself from the student. But then the group reconsidered and apologized for its momentary lapse of stridency. “Violence is the only path forward,” CUAD said in an official statement. That wasn’t a surprising admission; its public statements regularly celebrate martyrdom.\n\nWhen groups endorsed CUAD, they forced Jewish students to confront a painful choice. To participate in beloved activities, they needed to look past the club’s official membership in an organization that endorsed the killing of Jews and the destruction of the world’s only Jewish-majority country.\n\nAccording to the task force, complaining about the alliance with CUAD or professing sympathy for Israel could lead to a student being purged from an extracurricular activity. When a member of the dance team questioned the wisdom of supporting CUAD, she was removed from the organization’s group chats and effectively kicked off the team. A co-president of Sewa, a Sikh student group, says that she was removed from her post because of her alleged Zionism. In an invitation to a film screening, the founder of an LGBTQ group, the LezLions, wrote, “Zionists aren’t invited.”\n\nI’m not suggesting that Jews at Columbia feel constantly under siege. When I gave a speech at the campus Hillel group last spring, many members, even some who are passionate supporters of Israel, told me that they are happy at Columbia and have never personally experienced anything resembling anti-Semitism. The pro-Palestinian encampments included Jewish protesters, some of whom received abuse from their fellow Jews. To the task force’s credit, its report acknowledges many such complexities, but it brimmed with accounts of disturbing incidents worthy of a meaningful official response. Unfortunately, that’s not the Columbia way.\n\nHad I been wiser as an undergrad, I could have squinted and seen the roots of the current crisis. In the 1990s, Israel was a nonissue on campus: The Oslo peace process was in high gear, and a two-state solution and coexistence were dreams within reach. But the most imposing academic celebrity on campus was the Jerusalem-born Edward Said, a brilliant professor of literature, who had served as a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s legislative arm.\n\nDuring my years at Columbia, Said, who was battling cancer, was a remote figure. A dandy who loved his tweeds and was immersed in the European cosmopolitanism that he critiqued, he taught only a course on Giuseppe Verdi and imperialism.\n\nStill, he bestrode the university. His masterwork, Orientalism, was one of the few books by an active Columbia professor regularly included in the college’s core curriculum. That book, by the university’s most acclaimed professor, was also a gauntlet thrown in the community’s face. Said had convincingly illustrated how racism infected the production of knowledge in Middle Eastern studies. Even if scholarship paraded as the disinterested study of foreign cultures, it was inherently political, too often infected by a colonialist mindset.\n\nTo correct for that bias, admirers of Said’s book concluded, universities needed to hire a different style of academic, including scholars with roots in the region they studied, not just a bunch of white guys fascinated by Arabs. The Middle Eastern–studies department filled up with Said protégés, who lacked his charm but taught with ferocious passion. Because they were unabashed activists, these new scholars had no compunction about, say, canceling class so that students could attend pro-Palestinian rallies.\n\nJoseph Massad, a Jordanian-born political scientist who wrote a history of nationalism in his native country, became the most notorious of the new coterie soon after arriving in 1999. His incendiary comments provoked his ideological foes to respond with fury and, sometimes, to unfairly twist his quotes in the course of their diatribes. But his actual record was clear enough. Writing in the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram in 2003, he accused the Israelis of being the true anti-Semites, because they destroyed the culture of the Jewish diaspora; the Palestinians were the real Jews, he argued, because they were being massacred.\n\nViolence, when directed at Jews, never seemed to bother him. This moral vacuity was on full display in the column he wrote in response to October 7, which he called a “resistance offensive,” for The Electronic Intifada, a Chicago-based publication aligned with the more radical wing of the Palestinian cause. His essay used a series of euphoric adjectives—“astonishing,” “astounding,” “awesome”—to describe Hamas’s invasion, without ever condemning, let alone mentioning, the gruesome human toll of the massacre, which included rape and the kidnapping of babies. In fact, he coldly described the towns destroyed by Hamas as “settler-colonies.”\n\nMassad has long been accused of carrying that polemical style into the classroom. In the course description for a class called “Palestinian and Israeli Politics and Societies,” he wrote in 2002: “The purpose of the course is not to provide a ‘balanced’ coverage of the views of both sides.” On the one hand, that’s an admirable admission. On the other hand, Jewish students complained that he treated those with dissenting opinions as if they were moral reprobates, unworthy of civility.\n\nIn 2004, a pro-Israel group in Boston put together a low-budget documentary called Columbia Unbecoming, which strung together student testimony about the pedagogical style of Columbia’s Middle Eastern–studies program. To take two representative incidents: After an Israeli student asked Massad a question at an extracurricular event, the professor demanded to know how many Palestinians he had killed; a woman recounted how another professor, George Saliba, had told her not to opine on Israel-Palestine questions because her green eyes showed that she couldn’t be a “Semite.”\n\nIn response, Massad denied ever meeting the Israeli student; Saliba wrote that he didn’t recall the green-eyes comments and that the student might have misconstrued what he was saying. But Columbia’s then-president, Lee Bollinger, instantly recognized the problem and appointed his own task force to examine the complaints. But it would have taken more than a task force to address the underlying problem. The emerging style of the American academy, especially prevalent at Columbia, viewed activism flowing from moral absolutes as integral to the mission of the professoriat. But a style that prevailed in African American–studies and gender-studies departments was incendiary when applied to Israel. With race and gender, there was largely a consensus on campus, but Israel divided the university community. And as much as Bollinger professed to value dissenting opinions, his university was ill-equipped to accommodate two conflicting points of view. And the gap between those two points of view kept growing, as Said’s legacy began to seep into even the far reaches of Columbia.\n\nIf I were writing a satiric campus novel about Columbia, I would have abandoned the project on January 29. That’s the day the Spectator published lab notes for an introductory astronomy course, written by a teaching assistant, that instructed students: “As we watch genocide unfold in Gaza, it is also important to tell the story of Palestinians outside of being the subjects of a military occupation. Take 15 minutes or so to read through the articles ‘Wonder and the Life of Palestinian Astronomy’ and ‘In Gaza, Scanning the Sky for Stars, Not Drones.’ Remind yourself that our dreams, our wonders, our aspirations … are not any more worthy.” At Columbia, a student couldn’t contemplate the Big Dipper without being forced to consider the fate of Khan Yunis.\n\nThis was a minor scandal, but a representative one. Over the years, the subject of Israel became nearly inescapable at Columbia, even in disciplines seemingly far removed from Gaza. For a swath of graduate students and professors, Palestinian liberation—and a corollary belief that Israel is uniquely evil among nations—became something close to civic religion.\n\nIn 2023, at the School of Public Health, a professor who taught a section of its core curriculum to more than 400 students denounced Jewish donors to the university as “wealthy white capitalists” who laundered “blood money” through the school. He hosted a panel on the “settler-colonial determinants of health” that described “Israel-Palestine” as a primary example of a place where the “right to health” can never be realized. Several years ago, the Graduate School of Architecture, Preservation and Planning offered a class on “Architecture and Settler Colonialism” and hosted an event titled “Architecture Against Apartheid.”\n\nBy insisting that Israel is the great moral catastrophe of our age, professors and graduate students transmitted their passions to their classes. So it is not surprising that Jewish students with sympathy for Israel found themselves subject to social opprobrium not just from their teachers, but also from their peers. In its September report, the task force that Shafik had convened described the problem starkly: “We heard about students being avoided and avoiding others” and about “isolation and even intimidation in classrooms, bullying, threats, stereotypes, ethnic slurs, disqualification from opportunities, fear of retaliation and community erosion.” This was the assessment of Columbia professors, many of them unabashed liberals, who risked alienating colleagues by describing the situation bluntly.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters march around Columbia in April 2024. (Michael M. Santiago / Getty)\n\nIn September, the task force presented its findings to Columbia’s University Senate, an elected deliberative body that brings faculty, administrators, and students into the governance of the institution. Its creation was a utopian response to the 1968 protests. But the senate session about anti-Semitism was a fiasco. Almost from the start, members began to attack the task-force report’s motives and methodology—even its focus on discrimination against Jews. “No such resources were put into covering anybody else’s subjective experience on this campus,” the English professor Joseph Slaughter said, “and I think that creates real problems for the community.” The hostility to the report wasn’t meaningless fulmination; it was evidence of how a large part of the faculty was determined to prevent the university from acknowledging the presence of anti-Jewish activity in the school.\n\nNo other university has a governance structure quite like Columbia’s, and for good reason. Most academics with busy lives want to avoid endless meetings with their colleagues, so most professors aren’t rushing to join the senate. In recent years, the senate has attracted those of an activist bent, who are willing to put up with tedium in service of a higher cause. Two members of the rules committee were allegedly part of a faculty contingent that stood guard around the encampments on the quad. They did so even though they had jurisdiction over potentially disciplining those protesters. As it happens, exceedingly few of the protesters who flagrantly disregarded university rules have suffered any consequences for their actions. Columbia didn’t impose discipline on students who stormed Hamilton Hall last spring—at least not until last week, amid Trump’s threat of drastic cuts to the university. But by then, a culture of impunity was firmly rooted.\n\nBarnard College is integrated into Columbia, but it has its own set of rules, its own governance structure and disciplinary procedures. And it acted swiftly to expel two of the students who were in the group that burst into Avi Shilon’s class in January. (Columbia had suspended another participant, pending an investigation, and failed to identify the other.) For once, it felt as if the university was upholding its basic covenant with its students: to protect the sanctity of the classroom.\n\nBut instead of changing anyone’s incentives, Barnard’s hard-line punishment inspired protesters to rush Millbank Hall, banging drums and chanting, “There is only one solution, intifada revolution.” In the course of storming the building, they allegedly assaulted a Barnard employee, sending him to the hospital. For more than six hours, they shut down the building, which houses the offices of the administration, and left only after the college threatened to bring in the police and offered an official meeting with the protesters. But the possibility of police action wasn’t a sufficient deterrent, because a week later, two dozen protesters returned to occupy Barnard’s library.\n\nIn some deep sense, the university had lost the capacity to reassert control, let alone confront the root causes of the chaos. And looking back over the past few months, I see a pattern of events that, in some ways, is far more troubling than the encampments that received so many headlines. In November, protesters descended on the building that houses Hillel, the center of Jewish life on campus—its main purpose is to provide Jewish students with religious services and kosher food—and demanded that the university sever ties with the organization. The next month, a demonstrator marching up Broadway punched a kippah-wearing Jew in the face. In January, to memorialize the murder of a Palestinian girl, protesters filled the toilets of the School of International and Public Affairs with cement. Skewering two Jewish women affiliated with the school—its dean, Keren Yarhi-Milo, and an adjunct assistant professor at the school, Rebecca Weiner—they spray-painted the message “Keren eat Weiner,” with an image of feces.\n\nAll of this unfolded as the Trump administration launched an assault on higher education. But thus far, Columbia students haven’t bothered to protest that. Unlike Palestine, which for most students is a distant cause, the stripping of federal funding for the institution will ripple through the lives of students and faculty. But university activism has its sights obsessively locked on Israel.\n\nThat Trump assault on Columbia has now arrived, in the heaviest-handed form. Anti-Semitism on campus, a problem that merits a serious response, has been abused in the course of Trump’s quest to remake America in his image. Tellingly, the administration’s withholding of federal grants will fall hardest on the hard sciences, which are the part of the university most immune to anti-Semitism, and hardly touch the humanities, where overwrought criticisms of Israel flourish.\n\nThe indiscriminate, punitive nature of Trump’s meddling may unbalance Columbia even further. A dangerous new narrative has emerged there and on other campuses: that the new federal threats result from “fabricated charges of antisemitism,” as CUAD recently put it, casting victims of harassment as the cunning villains of the story. In this atmosphere, Columbia seems unlikely to reckon with the deeper causes of anti-Jewish abuse on its campus. But in its past—especially in its history of overcoming its discriminatory treatment of Jews—the institution has revealed itself capable of overcoming its biases, conscious and otherwise, against an excluded group. It has shown that it can stare hard at itself, channel its highest values, and find its way to a better course.",

This particular dream is of a world in which clean, abundant energy flows from nuclear plants and rooftop solar panels; medical advancements have made life better and longer; and artificial intelligence has come not to doom us but to save us from the drudgeries of work. This is the shared vision—part techno-optimism, part liberal reverie—put forth by The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson and The New York Times’ Ezra Klein in their new book, Abundance.\n\nIn their telling, what stands between humanity and this future are not just the usual culprits—conservatives and Big Business—but also liberals. The self-described champions of clean energy, transit, and affordable housing have allowed those goals to fall by the wayside while they prioritize onerous regulations, processes, and a myriad of competing interest groups.\n\nOn today’s episode of Good on Paper, Thompson and Klein join the show to talk about why states like California and New York struggle to achieve the priorities they claim to have. Why is high-speed rail nothing but a dream? Why does Texas build more utility-scale solar than California? Why is New York, a state run by Democrats, unable to tackle its affordable-housing crisis?\n\n“My first book about polarization, Why We’re Polarized, was very much about how polarization, particularly asymmetric polarization on the right, has deranged national politics,” Klein told me. “But I think it’s also important, then, to ask: Well, okay, in the places where liberals govern—you know, California, Illinois, New York—how come I can’t point to that and say, Hey—look at utopia over there?”\n\n“Liberalism should be an advertisement for liberalism,” Thompson added. “Democrats should be able to say, Vote for us, and we’ll make America like California. And instead, Republicans can say, Vote for Democrats, and they’ll turn America into California. They’ll turn America into Portland; they’ll turn America into Oregon.”\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nJerusalem Demsas: The United States is the wealthiest nation on Earth, at a time when the world is richer than it ever has been, and yet our politics are defined by scarcity. Scarcity of housing, of energy, and even of space has allowed zero-sum thinking to permeate the electorate, and that has been a boon for the forces of illiberalism.\n\nDonald Trump rode to victory last November fueled by zero-sum thinking. If there’s not enough to go around, then he’s your man. And now the question is whether the liberal response will be to fight him on his own terms or change the script.\n\nMy name’s Jerusalem Demsas, and this is Good on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives.\n\nIn a new book out today titled Abundance, by The New York Times’ Ezra Klein and The Atlantic’s Derek Thompson, the authors argue for a sea change in how liberals have approached politics. It’s a great book; we’ll put the link in our show notes. And I’m quoting from them here:\n\n“We imagine a future not of less but of more. We do not subscribe to the seductive ideologies of scarcity. We will not get more or better jobs by closing our gates to immigrants. We will not turn back climate change by persuading the world to starve itself of growth. It is not merely that these visions are unrealistic. It is that they are counterproductive. They will not achieve the futures they seek. They will do more harm than good.”\n\nThat paragraph is like catnip for people opposed to Donald Trump, but there are some very difficult intra-coalitional fights that will have to be waged in order for this world of abundance to become reality—because what’s standing in the way of abundant housing, transportation networks, and renewable energy is not only Republicans in Washington, D.C., but Democrats in California, New York, Massachusetts, and beyond.\n\nIt is Democrats who have stood up policies and practices that have allowed scarcity to fester in their own states, fueling a cost-of-living crisis unparalleled in Republican-led jurisdictions.\n\nHere to talk to me about this are the authors of Abundance. Ezra, Derek, welcome to the show!\n\nEzra Klein: Thank you. Good to be here.\n\nDerek Thompson: Great to be here, Jerusalem.\n\nDemsas: You guys co-wrote a book, and in the book, you write “our” and “we” a lot. And I had a fun time playing mini detective, trying to decipher which parts felt more Derek and which ones felt more Ezra. But what were some places of disagreement you discovered while writing the book? Are there ways you think differently about the problems of scarcity, Derek?\n\nThompson: I don’t think we disagree in the conclusions of the book, but I do think that our approaches are different. I think that I’ve never really been a politics-first writer or a politics-first podcaster. And when I wrote the original abundance-agenda essay, that was me dipping my toe into politics.\n\nAnd I’ve always felt a little bit more comfortable starting with economics or technology and then working my way into politics. And so I think that working with Ezra, who is so much more versed in modern politics and political history, was really educational in terms of thinking about many of the ideas that I debuted in that abundance-agenda essay as firmly political issues.\n\nAnd I think that as we worked together and talked on the phone and read each other’s drafts, there was a theme that’s not present in that original abundance essay, really very much at all, that we began to see as being absolutely essential for this book, which is the theme of: If you’re going to remake liberalism for the next generation, you have to take very seriously the shortcomings of liberalism in the previous generation. And that, for me, just speaking entirely personally, is something that absolutely emerged in conversations with Ezra, rather than appeared initially in my first conception of an abundance book about progress.\n\nSo that’s, I think, one place where it’s not so much a matter of disagreement as a matter of, sort of, our differences in approach leading to what I think is a very fruitful combination.\n\nKlein: So I think you can really see the differences between Derek and my approach if you just look at the titles of our two original essays here. So Derek, as he mentioned, had this great piece on abundance, and, you know, the framing of that is so sunny and optimistic, and everybody’s for abundance. And my piece was called “The Economic Mistake the Left Is Finally Confronting,” and I called it “supply-side progressivism.”\n\nAnd in that way, I think one of the really great things about working together on this is that Derek brings, I think, a forward-looking, sunnier optimism. And I bring a somewhat hard-nosed, Where the fuck did all this policy go wrong? you know, jaded-policy-reporter sense that I think creates a book that has the two sides of the coin that it needs.\n\nDemsas: Despite growing up on the East Coast—I feel like I’ve said this to Derek a bunch of times—he’s, like, the most West Coast East Coaster I’ve ever met, just perennially optimistic about the future.\n\nKlein: Sure. (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: In a way, that just seems super wrong. But, Ezra, you’re actually from the West Coast, so it’s like you’re switching.\n\nKlein: I’m the West Coaster, which is why I’m so pissed, because I was in California while doing all this work and thinking about why California was performing so terribly, despite being the greatest state the world has ever known.\n\nDemsas: So I’m going to ask you to harness some of that anger now, Ezra. So who are the roadblocks to abundant housing, clean energy, transportation, and tech innovation? Give me a villain.\n\nKlein: Just a nice, small question there.\n\nDemsas: Yes, exactly.\n\nKlein: Well, they’re different in the different areas. I think that’s one thing to say.\n\nBut I’ve thought about the set of roadblocks here as in different categories. So one is interests. You can think about trying to build an affordable-housing complex in San Francisco, and you get interests that are lined up against it for different reasons.\n\nSo one set of interests might be local homeowners who do not want a six-story affordable-housing complex down the block from them. They think it’ll hurt their parking. They think it will bring people they don’t want to the neighborhood. They think it’ll hurt their home values. So that’s very classic. Then you might have—depending on how this is built, you might have—unions, right? If the complex does not want to use union labor or does not want to pay prevailing wages, or they want to do modular construction off-site—as in one of the examples I reported on—you might have unions begin to fight that. You also have, just in general then, what I think of as policy drift. So there are certain programs, procedures, approaches that came into being at one time, maybe without anybody even really noticing it, and they become binding and difficult over time, but nobody’s ever revisited.\n\nSo again, holding on to the affordable-housing example, there is this kind of strange process in San Francisco—it was in California, I guess, but this specifically in San Francisco—around this thing called 14, I think, B or D; I forget which one. It began life as a racial preference. So it was meant to give the—in city contracts, you would have a preference for minority-owned contractors. Then the California Supreme Court—or no. I’m sorry. It was actually a proposition. California voters said, You can’t do that.\n\nSo then they went back, and the state, the city of San Francisco edited that procedure. And they said, Now it’s for small businesses and subcontractors, micro subcontractors, right? We, in San Francisco, have a rooting interest in making sure we have a healthy small-business ecosystem, and so there’s going to be a preference here for small businesses over big contractors, either in the city of San Francisco or even coming in from the outside.\n\nAnd everybody kind of knows that, in terms of how the city looks at it, it’s still sort of also a racial preference, if you can get there. But specifically, in language, it is a small-business preference. Most people just don’t know that’s there. That’s not really interests—I mean, small subcontractors do. But in general, that’s not a well-known thing. It’s not even doing the thing it was initially intended to do. So just over time, it’s become more binding. It’s drifted. It’s become a kind of procedural crust that I think would not be passed into law today if somebody was thinking about it. So that’s another one.\n\nThen you have sort of overlapping and complex authorities. You get this a lot in environmental issues. So, like, when you’re dealing with transmission lines, the number of players who have to sign off on something: Sometimes it’s local; sometimes it’s state. There’s overlapping federal authorities. That’s really difficult. You have very fractured authority. Nobody can consistently make the decision. So you begin to just have sort of category after category of things that, when you stack them, it just makes it very, very hard to get anything done.\n\nBut they’re not all ideological. They’re not all interest based. They’re not all anything. It is the problem of, as Steve Teles once called it, like, a “kludgeocracy” that has evolved over, you know, many decades.\n\nThompson: Let me jump in there. I think Ezra provided a really nice zoom-out answer from the local individual level to the higher-level factions and groups, starting with voters and homeowners, moving to economic factions, moving to the regulatory and legislative drift that exists in the laws and rules that are written, and then the overlapping authorities.\n\nI do want to introduce here the most macro answer to your question, Jerusalem, Who’s standing in the way of progress? Sometimes, it’s just the federal government, and I think it’s sometimes the federal government, in terms of the way that a lot of these policies that seem to be policies that would forward progressive ends end up stymieing progressive ends. There’s an incredible echo of that story that’s unfolded in the rollout of broadband-internet construction across the country after the Biden infrastructure bill.\n\nAnd so the top-line headline that I think a lot of people read in the Politico article, or other articles about the slow rollout of broadband construction, is that Biden authorized $42 billion to build broadband internet, and just a fraction of that money was spent, because of the paperwork required.\n\nBut why wasn’t the money spent? Why didn’t we actually do what we wanted to do? And I was asking people about this at a dinner that I went to recently, where everything was on background and not for attribution. But, you know, suffice it to say that people at this dinner had job titles that made it very clear that their testimony was highly relevant to the question of why it was hard to build rural broadband in this country when the government put $42 billion behind the effort.\n\nAnd their answer was: It wasn’t so much about the language of the legislation as the funding rules published by the Commerce Department that had workforce requirements and pricing requirements and climate-change requirements and bidding requirements, and so on and so on. And so essentially, you have the federal government saying, On the one hand, here’s federal money. Go forth and achieve a Democratic initiative, which is raising living standards for low-income Americans. I mean, just the most classic bread-and-butter progressive initiative. But also, they made the application process so onerous that nothing was built. And so, in fact, very little was actually done on behalf of the Americans for whom we wanted to raise their living standards.\n\nAnd I think this is a question that goes to—and this is a theme throughout, I think, Ezra’s answer—trade-offs in policy making and taking those trade-offs seriously. I think climate change is an important thing to care about. I don’t want the state of Virginia taking, say, federal money to build broadband internet and then charging poor rural folks, like, $200 a month to go online.\n\nBut by holding those values so closely and creating an application and funding process that extended the time that those authorized dollars were actually spent by two, three, three-and-a-half years, we accidentally built just about nothing. And now the entire program looks like it might just be, like, block granted to Elon Musk Inc. so he can do Starlink for America.\n\nSo this is what happens, I think, when at the federal level you also have this confusion of process versus outcomes, of wanting to fit everything in Ezra’s everything bagel into the process such that every you’ve stymied your ability to actually achieve the outcomes that you’ve indicated.\n\nDemsas: In both of your answers, I hear, and I think many people will hear, a critique that conservatives and libertarians have been making for a long time. From Ezra, I’m hearing, you know, there are too many interest groups that are demanding that their priorities be preferenced over the outcomes that benefit a broad number of people. And from Derek, I’m hearing pretty straightforwardly that government is standing in the way, that regulations are standing in the way, that process is standing in the way of free enterprise, of government. And in the book, you have, like, heavy citation of Mancur Olson’s work. And what distinguishes your project from the conservative kind of critique of liberalism? Is that—are you just trying to lib-wash conservatism?\n\nKlein: Goals.\n\nDemsas: Yeah?\n\nKlein: Goals, very simply. Which red state has decarbonized? Which red state is even trying? Which red state has high-speed rail? Which red state is even trying?\n\nI hear this sometimes from people, and I always think it’s weird. I always think it’s libertarians and conservatives so underselling their own project. Their project isn’t just deregulation. In many cases, they’re adding lots of new powers. Right? Like, look at their relationship to the surveillance state. Their project is to actually do things. It’s to gut Medicare and Medicaid because they feel that it is an unwise use of money to spend all that money on health insurance for poor people and the elderly.\n\nTheir project is to actively impede the construction of solar and wind [power], as we see the Trump administration doing right now. I was thinking about your question a second ago, Jerusalem, and thinking that the much cleaner answer I should have given was the villain is liberals in government who’ve oriented towards process and not outcome. The enemy is people who have said they’re going to deliver something, who believe in delivering that thing, and then have accepted process in which they do not end up delivering it, and then they explain it away, or explain away how hard they worked.\n\nBut by the way, this is how all the coalitions work. What is ultimately meaningful is outcome—the kind of world you are trying to live in, the kind of world you are trying to build. When Elon Musk and DOGE go in and decapitate USAID and cut off that funding, what they are doing, their outcome, their intention, their aim, their goal is not deregulation or cutting the federal workforce a little bit. Their aim is to stop delivering aid to poor people. That is what they believe that “America first” means: You do not spend our money preventing HIV/AIDS from infecting children in Africa. I think that’s monstrous. But that’s the aim. That’s the goal. And the means—decapitating USAID is the means to the goal.\n\nSo the difference between, I think, Derek and I, and conservatives and libertarians, is that we have different outcomes we’re trying to reach. I don’t think it makes sense for me and Donald Trump’s Department of Energy lead to debate how best to decarbonize, because he doesn’t want to decarbonize. Right? So I’ll have different things to do from that.\n\nDemsas: But does that matter? Because, I mean—\n\nKlein: Yeah.\n\nDemsas: No, but, I mean: in terms of the outcomes that you’re talking about here. So, I mean, in the book, you even cite this, but in response to your question about whether Texas has decarbonized: No, but they’re sure as hell siting a bunch of renewable energy. And when we talk about high-speed rail, I wouldn’t call it the highest-speed rail, but Brightline is reviving passenger rail in Florida; it might be reviving passenger rail in Nevada. It’s possible that Texas might even be given the opportunity to do high-speed rail now.\n\nI mean, there’s ways in which I, as a liberal myself, hear this all the time. And I struggle with this question because these places, despite their lack of interest in many of the goals that the three of us may have, are still executing on these goals.\n\nKlein: Yeah. I think that speaks to the power of defaults. And, I mean, we talk about this in the book. I mean, we cite specifically that Texas is building—and by the way, so is Georgia—a lot of renewable energy, but that’s because the default in Texas is to build things very easily. And so when the market sees an opportunity to make money building things—which, particularly under the IRA, it’s seen a very big opportunity to make money building renewable energy—it’ll be able to build it there, because they’ve simply made it straightforward. Although it is a question, I think, how long that would last for. You see a lot of political efforts in the Texas legislature to make it harder to build renewable energy.\n\nAnd now you see at the Trump level a lot of efforts to destroy the solar and, specifically, the wind industries, right? They’re actually trying to make that actively harder. So I think over time, there might be a lag before policy catches up with politics, but typically they do eventually begin to align on, you know, efficiently or inefficiently. You know, there are other things where Texas has just, like, way better affordable housing than California does, but conservatives don’t oppose affordable housing.\n\nSo I do think it’s absolutely true that you have places where there is a default, a path dependence that has made things happen even when you wouldn’t really expect it from a policy architecture. And in many ways, you know, probusiness conservatives should probably look at California and ask, Well, why does California dominate technologically to the extent that it does, given that you all seem to think your low taxes and your probusiness environments are so much better? Why aren’t any of these new AI companies located there? Why are they in California and not in Texas, and not in Oklahoma, and not in Florida?\n\nAnd some of that is California. But some of that is things that have been going on there for a long time. So the default is very, very, very strong. But that’s more how I look at that. Like, I think you should, as a liberal, look at how much easier it is to build renewable energy in Texas, and feel ashamed and try to change things. But I don’t think in the long run you will get liberal outcomes through conservative government, and you will not get the reverse. You will not get conservative outcomes through liberal government.\n\nThompson: I’ll pick up where Ezra left off, and then I’ll wind it back to your question, Jerusalem. I think it’s fantastic that Texas builds so much housing. I think it’s fantastic that Texas sites so much solar energy and has so much wind power. That’s a wonderful outcome for Texas and scale to be a wonderful outcome for America. But you know who doesn’t seem to recognize that? Our national libertarians and, more importantly, conservatives, right? Donald Trump could have run on the message, Let’s make America like Texas. Let’s build more solar. Let’s build more wind. Let’s build more housing.\n\nBut instead, despite the fact that he was lofted to power by, I think, in many ways, lots of frustration and furious anger about the state of housing in America, what is his housing agenda? He’s raising tariffs on essential housing materials that come from Canada and Mexico. He’s certainly doing nothing to help the construction industry, which is 25 percent foreign born, meet the demand that is absolutely going to be necessary to catch up with the housing deficit that we’ve built up over the last 20 years.\n\nSo while, yes, I think we should give Texas credit for the fact that its defaults lead, in many cases, to outcomes that liberals would want, it is not at all clear that at the national-politics level, this has trickled up into some kind of positive vision for how to remake America in a way that would help liberal ends. In fact, I think in many ways, it’s the opposite. And it brings us right back to, I think, Ezra’s great first answer to your question.\n\nThe difference between us and libertarians, and certainly the conservatives, is a positive vision of America. And I think it’s cool that this book starts off with, in maybe a little bit of a surprising way, a sci-fi vision of what America in 2050 might look like if we got everything right.\n\nWhat would clean-energy superabundance look like? What would AI look like? What would clean supersonic travel look like, and how would that change people’s lives? How could we eliminate so much of the suffering that’s been the result of chosen scarcities over the last 20 years by fixing it in the next 25?\n\nSo this book, in a very clear way that I don’t think you would see in a lot of conservative manifestos, starts with a very clear vision of a future that I think is unembarrassed about the degree to which its priorities are progressive. But I do think that the processes that progressives have built up over the last 50 years get in the way of making that future buildable.\n\nDemsas: So I absolutely loved the intro that you all wrote. As a sci-fi reader, I just felt completely immersed in that dreamworld. I want to ask you, though, about— there’s a sense in the book that many of the roadblocks to abundance are almost unwitting, right?\n\nLike, you talk about environmental regulations from a past era that were developed to block highways and pipelines, and to clean up the air and water, but are now, unfortunately, blocking solar power and transmission lines and affordable housing. Or that procedural rules—the ones that, you know, Ezra and Derek, you both outlined—are meant to prevent corruption and are, instead, preventing getting contracting done quickly and efficiently.\n\nBut, you know, here’s a place that I struggle because that’s a really, like, friendly story to liberals. It’s a story like, you know, You made a mistake. You know, now it’s time to fix it now that, you know, we’re pointing it out to you. But there are a lot of pieces of evidence that indicate people are not unwitting; they simply disagree. I’m sure you’ve come across this in your reporting, but, you know, there are environmental-justice advocates that have been loud critics of carbon-capture-and-storage technologies, who are fine arguing, to quote, “We simply cannot replace Big Oil with Big Renewable.”\n\nAnother example is Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who is actively undermining her most successful affordable-housing program because it was too good at getting housing built, and is layering on a bunch of process onto a very successful affordable-housing program because of complaints that it was actually siting multifamily housing.\n\nSo how much is this a story of liberals just, you know, We have laws and procedures that were well meaning from another era, versus there being a lot of liberals who simply disagree with these goals, even if they’re not willing to say it explicitly?\n\nKlein: I don’t think the story we tell is that it’s just unwitting. I mean, I quote you in the book, Jerusalem, in the housing chapter about the way in which part of the difficulty in building enough housing is that there is an ineradicable tension between making housing a core financial asset and building enough of it—because financial assets, valuable ones, become more valuable in conditions of scarcity. And so there is good reason for people who already live on a block where the housing, you know, is going up and up and up to not want to see that block suddenly get a very large apartment building in it.\n\nNow, there is a kind of alley-oop between the overhang of past legislation, statute, regulation, process, and some of those interests. I don’t think—in fact, I think I tell: I think the story is pretty clear that when California passed the California Environmental Quality Act under [then-Governor Ronald] Reagan—under Reagan—and nobody thought it was a very big deal, and the LA Times didn’t devote a single, sole article to its passage. And then, only later, after a series of court cases, did it apply not just to government projects but to any project requiring government permitting, which is sort of every project, actually, in California.\n\nSo all of a sudden, it becomes a much bigger deal than it was when it passed. And now it becomes a tool to stop housing, not just to do what the legislature initially intended. Well, then that’s different, right? You have a sort of union, then, between a bill that maybe you could not have passed under that argument, but now interests that have learned how to use that bill to follow their current interests.\n\nSo I don’t think—I mean, I would say that if I’ve given anybody the view that I don’t think this is going to be a series of unbelievably bloody fights in liberalism, I apologize. But I don’t actually think that’s the nature of the book. We do try to have a relatively optimistic tone throughout, and we do try to be understanding, because I do believe this to be true—and so does Derek, I think—that much of what was built in past statute-wise, much of what was built in the ’60s and ’70s was built for good reasons. Many of the things we need to unwind today were not villainous constructions. They were thoughtful responses to problems of another era that do not fit our current era.\n\nOne of the lines I like that we have is: Institutional renewal is a task that faces every generation anew. You can’t expect all the institutions and laws and bills and processes from 40 years ago or 50 years ago to fit the moment you’re in. But it’s just, I think, not the case. And I’ve been part of a lot of these fights already that that we’re particularly naive about whether or not people are protecting their interests here. Of course, they are.\n\nThompson: The origin of zoning and the origin of these environmental rules was absolutely inextricably bound up, in many cases, with pure, old-fashioned racism and a kind of selfishness for which neither I nor Ezra have any patience. I mean, Yoni Appelbaum in his book, Stuck, I think very clearly sets out the case that the first zoning laws in California in the 19th century were rather explicitly about finding legal ways to oppress and segregate and ghettoize the Chinese population after the Gold Rush.\n\nI mean, there’s no question that many of these rules have explicitly racist aims—had explicitly racist aims. And when you look at the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s, for all of the objective good that it did—I think you’ve written about the fact—some people used the overhang of environmentalism to essentially just be people against people.\n\nAnd it’s no accident, I think, that Rachel Carson’s book and [Robert] Caro’s book also happened to come out at the same time that [Paul] Ehrlich wrote The Population Bomb. And a lot of environmentalism in the 1960s and 1970s was in cases of fear of and an almost aversion to the idea of masses of people living on this planet. And we have no patience for, certainly, the most racist and hateful aspects of those laws from 60 and 70 years ago.\n\nThat said, I do think that it is true that some liberals today are simply antibusiness in a way that’s I’m not antibusiness. But I also think that it’s important to be fair to the environmental movement that came up in the 1960s and 1970s by pointing out that it was trying to solve problems that, in many cases, we don’t see in the same way today, because those problems were, in many cases, solved.\n\nThe air was disgusting in the 1950s. The rivers were disgusting in the 1950s. The amount of pollution that came out of tailpipes was freaking gross. And we passed a set of rules with the Clean Air [Act] and [Clean] Water Act and all sorts of other laws and regulations that cleaned up the air and cleaned up the water so that every time someone inhales in order to criticize environmentalism today, they are blessed by the fact that the air they inhale is cleaner as a result of the movement that they’re criticizing.\n\nBut to Ezra’s point, institutional renewal is the job of every generation, and we have allowed, I think, in many cases, wise rules that answered problems in the 20th century to become a disease of the 21st century, which is the inability to build in ways that would actually solve those problems, especially when it comes to, you know, rules like NEPA getting in the way of citing and constructing clean-energy technology.\n\nSo I want to be fair to what I took to be the thrust of your question, which is that, yeah, there were a lot of nauseous pieces of this ideology as it came up. But I also want to be fair to the fact that the environmentalist movement had very serious problems to respond to, in many ways solved lots of the problems they intended to solve. But now we’re left with the overhang. We haven’t done institutional renewal in this generation, and it’s time.\n\nDemsas: So both of you have touched on this a little bit in your answers, but the book is pretty explicitly written to liberals. You write, clearly, quote, “We don’t see ourselves as effective messengers to the right.”\n\nI wonder if you can talk a little bit about your decision to make that so clear. I mean, there are a lot of books where you can implicitly tell that it’s written to a specific audience. But, you know, the YIMBY movement, the Yes In My Backyard movement, has been really, really focused on trying to maintain bipartisanship and not cast the housing-abundance element of this as being a problem just for Democrats to focus on. And you, in your book, of course, cite this as well. So why is this book written for the left?\n\nKlein: I think you have to, in any writing project, decide what your problem that you’re trying to solve is. And, you know, Derek and I probably have different versions of this, but for me, some of the genesis of writing this book was simply what has gone wrong in California. California’s my state. I love it. And in California, every statewide elected official is a Democrat.\n\nYou had to sort of—my first book about polarization, Why We’re Polarized, was very much about how polarization, particularly asymmetric polarization on the right, has deranged national politics. But I think it’s also important, then, to ask: Well, okay, in the places where liberals govern—you know, California, Illinois, New York—how come I can’t point to that and say, Hey—look at utopia over there? You know, like, It’s going great. So that’s one dimension. I mean, there’s actually just a question for me I was trying to answer.\n\nAlthough, I will say, then, to the other side of it, I think that people on the right are going to get a lot out of this book. And I think in some ways, the decision to focus this as a kind of conversation among different flavors of people on the left will make it a little bit easier for them to hear it. Now, it’s going to come into this context of Donald Trump and Elon Musk and J. D. Vance and Russell Vought trying to destroy the federal government. So the right’s got its own sort of questions it’s going to need to figure out.\n\nBut in terms of state-level issues, in terms of, you know, affordable housing, I think there’s a funny dynamic right now around YIMBYism particularly, where, look—the YIMBYs, they want to be bipartisan, but they arose in California, right? That has always been, in its initial incarnation, a movement that is different flavors of Democrats talking to each other. But they have had a bigger effect, I think, in some ways, on red states than on blue ones, because as much as their intellectual victory has happened among liberals of different sorts—you heard, you know, Kamala Harris promising 3 million new homes and Barack Obama talking about the DNC—like, as we both know, as we all know, there’s not a housing-supply increase in San Francisco, where YIMBYism really begins. There’s not a housing-supply increase in California.\n\nLike, I was just looking at FRED data for private housing starts over the past 10 years, and it is lower in January 2025 than it was in January of 2015. On the other hand, Montana has put forward great YIMBY policies, right? Florida and Miami, in particular, have done some really, really good things. And I don’t want to take away. Like, there was a good upzoning in Gowanus, in New York City. The “City of Yes” policies in New York, I think, are promising.\n\nBut I do think sometimes other coalitions can look without having to activate all their internal defenses at a fight happening on the other side and think, Okay, what can we learn from that? So I think our hope is to have constructive conversations with people on the right, as well. But specifically because a lot of this book is about achieving liberal goals, it just, I think, didn’t make sense to try to say that the problems were going to be the same everywhere, because a lot of the things that the right is doing that I don’t like, they’re doing it because they want a world I don’t want. And telling them they’re wrong to be doing it then doesn’t make a ton of sense.\n\nThompson: Certainly, a good excuse for us is that a book about how the left needs to get better at focusing is a book that explicitly focuses on its audience and says in the opening chapter, here’s who we’re writing this book for. Because if you’re writing a book about what went wrong in America over the last 50 years, there is maybe an infinitude of stories that you could tell, an infinitude of audiences you want to tell those stories to. But I like the fact that we say, This is a book about how we want liberalism to change. And telling liberals to not be conservatives is essentially telling them to not do the thing they’ve already decided they definitely don’t want to do.\n\nSo that’s a way in which I think the focus of this book, even though you’re absolutely right that it says from the start, Look: There are conservatives who are doing their own thing. We wish them well—I think that’s the line explicitly—this is a book about how we want liberalism to change in America, because we have a vision of America that we believe to be in keeping with liberal outcomes and liberal priorities.\n\n[Music]\n\nDemsas: After the break: Is localism standing in the way of abundance?\n\n[Break]\n\nDemsas: So I definitely want to come back to the electoral side of this, but before then, because you both are trapped on my podcast, I’m going to ask you about my work, which has been really focused on decentralization and localism. And this is a thing that I think you know: I loved your book. I think it’s great. I think everyone should buy it. We will put links to everything you are saying at the—\n\nKlein: You gotta say that at the top, Jerusalem. (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: It’ll be in the intro. Don’t worry. (Laughs.)\n\nKlein: You can’t hope people are going to make it all the way here. (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: Yeah. People aren’t going to make it to even minute 30 of this podcast.\n\nSo, you know, I think the thing that’s missing in your book, for me, was a discussion of decentralization and localism, because something I have become pretty strongly convinced of is that even when you have alignment of a lot of these interests towards abundance, towards growth, the thing that becomes difficult is: It’s really, really hard to do anything if you have to get a thousand people on board.\n\nAnd so you get the situation where, you know, someone who I was talking to who works really strongly in transportation told me that he’d had a conversation with a Swedish transportation planner who was shocked to realize that when a project got a right of way, when it got permission to use an area of road from one part of the government, it did not mean that it didn’t have to go to multiple other levels of government to get that. Like, he just could not believe that’s how we did things here.\n\nAnd so to me, I think that this is a core problem of abundance that abundance has to deal with. And I think it’s one of the hardest parts because there’s a way to get people animated about housing. There’s a way to get people animated about energy. I mean, these are core things that people think about in their lives. But trying to get people on board with a vision of how you streamline government, in a very boring way—putting together offices, making sure there are fewer local governments in consolidation—like, this is not a popular thing, and it’s not a thing that people are willing to focus on. So is the fact that it’s left out an indication that you don’t view this as a core part of the goals of abundance? Or what’s going on here?\n\nThompson: Jerusalem, you know the dynamics of localism better than I do, but I’ve done a bit of reporting on opposition to housing and the [Research] Triangle area, in North Carolina. And the layers here are very interesting because you have NIMBY residents who understand the machinery of opposition. So if there’s a new development that’s up for a vote, these folks know where to show up. They know what council meetings to make statements at. They know how to pitch those statements directly to the council.\n\nAnd then in many cases, the council members are, in some cases, antibuild activists who ran for office and pride themselves in standing up against developers. And so it’s not just about changing minds in the public; it’s also about the phenomenon of these meetings. And it’s about the people who sit on the councils.\n\nAnd I’ve asked people down here in government, What would change this? What would change this dynamic and make it easier to build housing? And some of it they said is just, You need new people in the city council who are going to vote for housing rather than associate good governance with the ability to always discover reasons to oppose new developments, right? Some of it is just a matter of personnel in the city council.\n\nSome of it, they said, is a matter of retail politics and persuasion. It’s a matter of making the case when you’re talking to folks that you’re the mayor or you’re the city council because your priority is to expand housing development no matter what. And you’re going to repeat that priority at every city council meeting over and over and over, and it’s going to be your north star. And you’re not going to allow other process-oriented priorities to eclipse it.\n\nBut sometimes it’s just a matter of political courage. It’s a mayor or a city council member standing up in one of these city council meetings where the audience is, you know, 80–20 against new development and pointing out a fact that I believe you, Jerusalem, have told me many times, which is that: For every one person in this room who has the time and energy and resources to appear here, there are 10 people not in this room who will be helped by housing abundance. And so what we are seeing, what we are seeing in this room in the city council meeting, is a meeting that is oriented around caring for the people who get up in front of the microphone. But being in government means caring about the people who don’t have time to come here and step up to the mic.\n\nAnd I think that kind of political courage is akin to—not equivalent to, but akin to—what we saw in Pennsylvania with [Governor Josh] Shapiro and [PennDOT Secretary Mike] Carroll essentially saying, Look—we’ve got a bridge that fell down in I-95, and we can go through the regular processes, and it can take—What?—12, 24 months to rebuild this bridge. We can have, you know, procurement rules, and we can have bidding rules, and we can have environmental review that goes on and on, and we can have permitting. But fundamentally, we need to put this thing up in two weeks. And so that’s what they did. They put it up in two weeks. They said, No environmental reviews. We’re going to get this contractor over here, and this contractor over here to build the damn thing as soon as possible. And they built the damn thing as soon as possible. It took 12 days and not 12 months.\n\nSo I do think that a lot of this comes down to political courage, and it’s going to take political courage to do what you are talking about, to take a culture of federalized localism and say, You know what? I think we might be better off if we limit the number of opportunities that people who oppose development in this city have to block every single thing that happens. And I’m just going to go on the road and say over and over again: I’m not doing this to limit citizen voice. In a way, I’m doing it to raise citizen voice, because I care more about the voices of the people who are not complaining on the mic every two months. I care about those voices more than I care about the people who happen to have time to go up in front of the microphone.\n\nThat’s a hard thing to say, and I cannot guarantee that it’s politically popular enough to win election after election. But I do think that fundamentally what you’re asking for is not just a procedural, not just a sort of a governance, organizational change. It’s a matter of personality. It’s a matter of courage as well.\n\nKlein: I think that’s right. I really want to pick up on that idea that it’s a matter of personality. One of the core theses of the book—I’m not sure how explicitly we say it outside of the Mancur Olson section—is that modern liberalism is overly process focused, that it has repeatedly substituted process for outcome. And that takes different shapes in different places.\n\nSo when you’re dealing with things that require local approval, like housing, you often have that as the problem of decentralization, right? The power is split, fractured—these meetings that have very, very unrepresentative samples of the population showing up. But when you’re dealing with other areas, right? Like, I spent a bunch of time on the CHIPS and Science Act in the book, and the Notice of Funding Opportunity and all of the everything-bagel provisions and added standards and goals that got put into there.\n\nAnd that wasn’t localism. That wasn’t even decentralization. That was done centrally at the Commerce Department. And I report on that, and I know a bunch of the people involved. That was just coming out of a culture in liberalism, of personalities, as Derek put it a second ago, that just kind of doesn’t want to say no to anybody, that wants everybody in the coalition to be as happy as possible.\n\nSo I think that the view that I at least came to, ultimately—I don’t want to speak for Derek here—is that this is all manifestations of something similar that we don’t have, like, a really good way to talk about. But it’s closer to the temperament of a coalition. If the temperament of the MAGA coalition right now is autocratic, the temperament of the liberal coalition is bureaucratic. And in becoming bureaucratic, it shapes itself differently at different levels of government. But sort of at all of them, somebody needs to be in the meeting who can say, Enough. Thank you, everybody, for your opinions. We are going to do this. Sometimes that is a question of power. Sometimes that is a question of leadership. Sometimes you don’t have the ability to do that, and we need to restructure the way, in theory, at least, that the overlapping, jurisdictional issues are handled.\n\nThat’s very, very hard to do, and I think you should be very pessimistic about good outcomes if that’s your only approach that will work. And sometimes it’s that somebody needs to just say it and, like, be willing to take the political pain for saying it. I sort of think this is somehow connected to educational polarization in the parties—this is not in the book, because I can’t prove it—\n\nDemsas: (Laughs.) That’s what podcasts are for.\n\nKlein: Right? I think this is connected in a way that educational polarization in the parties, in the way that the Democratic Party has aligned to become the prosystem party, and the Republican Party is aligned more to become the antisystem party. And you just have a relationship to systems and processes and bureaucracies that are different on the two sides.\n\nAnd there are huge pathologies in the Republican approach to this. It is not good that nobody can tell Donald Trump no. It is not good that they don’t listen to anybody else, that they don’t give a shit what any of the Republicans in Congress think. It is not good that if you tell Elon Musk he’s believing conspiracy theories, he will tell you to fuck off, and fire you from his company or throw you out of the meeting, right?\n\nI actually have this whole view—and, again, not in the book, but we’re in Podcast Land here—that the temperaments of the two coalitions have polarized into very unhealthy personality types. Basically, the coalitions need an ecosystem of different personalities in them: some who are more authoritarian, like, a little bit, right? Some who are much more process oriented. It was good for the Democratic coalition that it had its antisystem hippies inside of it. Now that, you know, as Matt Yglesias puts it, the crank realignment has put RFK Jr. and all those people in the Republican Party, they’re too crankish. And, in a way, the Democratic Party is insufficiently skeptical of big corporations and big systems.\n\nSo there’s something here that I think is really important. It’s very hard to prove, but I do think it’s temperamental. And it sometimes comes out, as you were saying, in too much localism, but not only in that. If it were only in that, then we would just have a big chapter on how localism is a problem. But because we see it rhyming across so many places often where localism has nothing to do with it, I think it’s something broader.\n\nDemsas: One of the things that I love about your book is how much you focus on abundance as, like, a vibe shift and not just a laundry list of policy changes, but that there needs to be a serious reorientation in how people think about themselves, their roles, what liberalism is for. I mean, you analogize it to how environmentalism was this lens that gave everyone a different way of viewing government and industry and the goals of liberalism. And, you know, abundance is hopefully another lens that people can use and apply.\n\nBut both of you have brought up Trump and Musk a bunch of times in this conversation, and I imagine someone coming to this conversation fresh—coming to your book fresh, and hasn’t been deeply involved in the debates that we all have been for the past several years in the abundance space—might be confused as to why this book is coming out now, hitting liberals for undermining government. And, of course, publishing timelines are what they are.\n\nBut Ben Wallace-Wells wrote a review of your book, and books of friends of the show Yoni Appelbaum and Marc Dunkelman, for The New Yorker. And he made the following comment that I hope you guys can respond to: “The abundance advocates emphasize the problem of ideology, because of who usually wrote the rules, but what’s happening is also, more simply, about wealth and power. When it comes to the expense of New York’s subways, the latest studies identify some specific culprits: the city builds many more mezzanine levels in its stations than is the case in stations overseas, and it hires more consultants. How much of that is really about liberalism?”\n\nHe goes on to say that it is “flatly ahistorical” to blame liberals for lack of progress on climate change. So I guess the question that has been posed to me multiple times as well is: Are we all just engaged in a long line of liberal self-flagellation and are ignoring the elephant in the room that is the Republican and Trump-Musk administration? Or is Ben wrong?\n\nKlein: I think Ben is wrong. (Laughs.)\n\nLook: I wrote a whole book about how much you can’t get done at the national level because of Republicans. So I sort of take a back seat to nobody on that, and that’s a huge amount of my coverage. But does Ben think California is well governed? Does Ben think New York is well governed? Does Ben think Illinois is well governed? Does Ben think these places where Republicans hold zero power are losing people by coincidence?\n\nAt some point, you have to be able to say, It’s not the only thing happening in the world that the other side is bad. Now, it’s awkward to bring out this book—I mean, in some ways, it’s helpful; in some ways, it’s awkward—to bring it, you know, during the Elon Musk–Donald Trump–DOGE era. Although, I do think that it gives us a kind of way to talk about: If you don’t make government work—really make it work—if you do not actually truly care that people can feel it in their lives, that you don’t have these debacles, like $42 billion for broadband that doesn’t give anybody broadband access, then you’re going to open the door for right-wing populists to come in and burn it down.\n\nBut I think that there is—sometimes I’m reading reviews. I’m actually pretty comfortable with bad reviews. I’ve been in this game for a very long time. And—\n\nDemsas: I don’t think it’s even a bad review.\n\nKlein: Ben’s wasn’t a bad review. That’s not what I’m saying. Ben’s was actually a very good piece.\n\nBut the thing I was going to say is that sometimes in reviews, you can tell when you have tripped people’s preference for affect, right? They just, like, want more Republican bashing in the thing, right? They want what Tyler Cowen would call more “mood affiliation.” And I just think we actually need less of it. And I think one way you develop credibility as a political tendency is you admit where you’ve gone wrong.\n\nYes, it is the case that it is substantially due to Republican opposition at the national level that we have not been able to pass more on climate. On the other hand, it is not the case that Republican opposition is why, after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, Democrats never did permitting reform to make sure that the money it is spending could build enough of the green infrastructure it intends to build at the speed that we need to build it.\n\nRepublicans actually were willing to work with Democrats on that. It was Democrats who did not want to go forward there. Now, the Biden administration sort of hid behind Joe Manchin and supported Joe Manchin’s permitting bills, but liberals hated Manchin. And by the way, Joe Manchin’s permitting reform is not what I would’ve done.\n\nSo I think you just gotta be really careful. There are, I think, very good critiques of this. But why, you know, we have to spend more time blaming Republicans for our own failures I actually just don’t think is one of them, and I think it’s a kind of intellectual-failure mode in politics.\n\nI think we’ve got to spend a lot of time blaming Republicans for Republican failures, and they’re currently attempting an autocratic breakthrough at the top of the U.S. government. And, like, obviously, I cover that day in and day out, but I think liberals don’t take their own failures nearly seriously enough. And the real problem with that, in addition to that then we can’t fix them, is also: Voters notice. And voters don’t trust you.\n\nGavin Newsom wants to run for president with the burning desire of a thousand suns. Right? He wants it so bad. And Gavin Newsom has every right to run for president. The guy’s governor of California. He’s going to have a huge problem running for president, because people don’t think California’s well governed. And it’s not even that he hasn’t been trying to change a bunch of that. I think a lot of what Gavin Newsom has been trying to do is good, but the fact of the matter is: Housing is a disaster. Homelessness is a disaster. They haven’t built high-speed rail. And none of it has been solved.\n\nSo that’s another issue. You begin destroying total generations, really, of political talent because they’re coming out of a place where they can’t defend what they’ve done. Like, does anybody want Kathy Hochul to run for president? When people don’t think the places you run are working, it doesn’t then work to say, Trust us.\n\nAnd so I just don’t think you can—like, it is true that part of why various decarbonization actions have not worked is due to Republican opposition and obstruction. And again, that’s all mentioned in the book. But it’s just also true that we haven’t done a good enough job. And that’s part of the reason Texas and Georgia and a bunch of red places are building more out of the IRA than liberal states. The places where liberal states are getting more IRA money is in the credits to buy things that are built elsewhere.\n\nThompson: Yeah. To the extent that Ezra and I disagree about anything, certainly no disagreements have been revealed in the last 55 minutes. Because I want to echo and amen with hands over my head everything that he just said, and also, ladle some extra defensiveness on top of it.\n\nYou know, to the extent that Ben thinks it is flatly historical that liberals are the principal enemies of climate change, I just want to be very clear: All four of us—me, Ezra, Jerusalem, Ben—all know that this is in the book and that we all agree about this. I mean, we say in the first chapter that it’s no point talking to Republicans about climate-change goals if so many Republicans don’t even believe in or prioritize climate change.\n\nAnd then as we talk about in the penultimate chapter, the U.S.—I don’t think this is well understood—in the 1970s was, in many ways, the world leader on solar energy. And we basically gutted our energy R&D and our solar industry because Ronald Reagan comes into office and puts a dentist in as the head of the Department of Energy and takes the solar panels off the roof of the White House. And basically, we decide for the next 30 years that we’re not going to do anything about the development of solar energy.\n\nSo that is in the book, and it is absolutely the case that if both parties agreed with the fervor of the Democrats that climate change was a problem, we’d be in a very different state in terms of the amount of zero-carbon energy that we produce in this country. That’s No. 1.\n\nNo. 2: I think the most important part of Ezra’s message right there is that liberalism should be an advertisement for liberalism. And if it isn’t, then we’ll lose. One of the best lines in the book, and this was Ezra’s addition, is that Democrats should be able to say, Vote for us, and we’ll make America like California. And instead, Republicans can say, Vote for Democrats, and they’ll turn America into California. They’ll turn America into Portland; they’ll turn America into Oregon.\n\nWe don’t want to give them this ammunition, because it’s incredibly effective to say that the places that liberals run are, unfortunately, not run well. And finally, on the issue of, say, the Second Avenue subway, you know, I was talking to Sam Bowman for an article in The Atlantic about the degree to which the U.K. could use an abundance agenda. And he made a really interesting point, because if there’s any country that has a worse problem of building than America, it’s clearly the U.K., which has basically been on a downward slope since, you know, something like the Victorian era when it came to building things in that country.\n\nAnd I said, you know, Why does Spain and Portugal—why do these countries, which don’t rival Britain in terms of wealth—seem to do so much better on building things? And he said, In Spain in particular, you’ve had coalitions in government that run on their ability to build quickly and effectively. And I was like, Jesus Christ. What a concept. I mean, imagine a mayor of New York running on New York accelerating the degree to which it’s building the Second Avenue subway at a cost that isn’t $2 billion per square mile. Imagine someone being able to run for governor of New York for, say, another term by saying, Look at our progress in high-speed rail, and look at our progress with homelessness.\n\nThis idea of people running for government by pointing to their achievements at making government work, that’s unbelievable to me. And that’s what we should aim for. We should aim for liberals being able to run by saying, Look at how I made liberalism work where liberalism had power. And right now, I don’t think that there are enough places that can do that. And as a result, I think it’s hard for liberalism to build power without those advertisements.\n\nDemsas: You guys are making a couple of electoral arguments, both in the book and implicitly in what you’ve been saying here. One is that, you know, the specific messaging-argument problem, which is just, like, If you can’t point to the thing that you’ve done and say it’s good, then why would people vote for you? But then you also are kind of drawing out some math problems for Democrats when it comes to population loss in blue states making it harder for Democrats to win the electoral college, reducing congressional representation in the House.\n\nBut I think the thing that struck me as the most important are the arguments you make about how scarcity fuels illiberalism. Can you draw out those arguments for me?\n\nKlein: I love it. Well, we do quote you in those arguments. Do you want to draw those arguments? (Laughs.)\n\nDemsas: That’s why they’re so good. (Laughs.)\n\nThompson: What’s your favorite passage of a Jerusalem Demsas article? And just read it slowly and mellifluously.\n\nDemsas: Sure. Let’s do that.\n\nKlein: Yeah, there’s a lot of Jerusalem Demsas in the book. I think you had the best piece on this, so I’m going to do the weird podcaster thing and be like, How do you think scarcity draws out of liberalism?\n\nDemsas: Well, first of all, you guys are very generous citers. Anyone who is interested in reading more, it’s very easy. There’s, like, a hundred pages of notes and acknowledgements in here. But I think on this question of illiberalism, this is something that got into my head, particularly, when it came to Trump and Vance’s campaigning against immigration. And of course, I’m not making the claim that there are no legitimate concerns about immigration. We’ll park that for a second.\n\nWhat we saw was clearly a weaponization of scarcity, and the problem of scarcity incites one of two possible responses, right? Either it’s: There’s not enough. I have to defend my own. I have to, you know, eventually make sure that other people can’t take housing that could go to my child, or this really good job might go to an immigrant or to a person of color, or to a woman and not to me or my family member or friend. And that’s, like, one very natural response to scarcity.\n\nAnd the other is liberalism. It’s the promise that you can make more, that there can be enough housing for everyone who needs it, that there can be, you know, enough good-quality jobs that new people coming into your community isn’t a threat to your way of life. It’s actually making your life better. But the problem is that that has to actually be true, right? And as you talk about in these blue states, I mean, there is a problem where they have made housing scarce That has created a serious problem. And, I mean, we saw that in Springfield, Ohio, as a very effective cudgel for Trump and Vance to wield.\n\nAnd so to me, abundance is a necessary prerequisite for liberalism at large. If you want people to feel open to expanding rights to people who are different from them, to be open to new things happening, to change immigration, whatever it is, they have to feel like there’s an abundance of opportunity. You’re never going to look at a choice between an immigrant and your child in the housing market and decide to go with the immigrant, you know what I mean?\n\nSo the thing I want to get from you two is, like: I worry that many people are taking a policy critique, something about the goals that we might have with decarbonization, with abundant housing, with a bunch of other things and trying to make it into an electoral argument. Because right now, in particular, the Democratic Party is searching for a way towards relevancy, and there’s room to make an argument to that set of policy makers.\n\nSo do you think that we are—and I mean me, in particular, that I’m—overstating the importance of abundance from an electoral standpoint? Like, how much of it is important, given that we’re in this populist moment, you know, that’s very anticentralization, very opposed to government, lots of people excited by the so-called DOGE efficiency move? So how much of this is just wish casting that we’re doing? And is it really relevant to Democrats’ electoral outcomes that they’re focused on abundance?\n\nKlein: Well, let me say a few things. One is that we’re definitely not in a moment that is anticentralization, because we’ve never seen a presidency working as hard to centralize power. Not never, but in the modern era, we haven’t seen a presidency working as hard to centralize power and actively centralizing power as Donald Trump. And certainly his, you know, quote-unquote populist right is loving that, which, to be fair, is how the populous right usually is. It’s a highly centralized, you know, The people will have their voice through the leader who authentically represents the will of the people and wields power without check, balance, or oversight.\n\nSo it’s always kind of a contradictory mess. But that’s, I think, the moment we’re in. And I do think it does exist a little bit as a response to highly bureaucratized liberalism, although that’s not the only thing, obviously, it’s responding to.\n\nOne of the things I was thinking about when you were saying that, Jerusalem, was Elon Musk and the way in which, I mean, it’s like we’re in Dark Elon Musk territory, very much so. Because you can imagine this other Elon Musk, right? Elon Musk as a political figure, you know, from 2012, 2014 who is proabundance, because Elon Musk’s career is, like, an amazing set of proof points for at least part of what, you know, Derek and I want to see in the world.\n\nHere you have an immigrant who came to America. He then set up, first, a series of businesses in the lightly regulated digital sector. But then he began moving into the highly regulated automobile and go-to-space sectors, and solar, for that matter. And then he built these companies on the back of government subsidies, government loan guarantees, and government contracts, becoming the single-best example—living example—for what public-private partnerships can accomplish.\n\nLike, you can really imagine Elon Musk as this unbelievable messenger of abundance and trying to make possible more of the kind of thing he did for more companies, more people. Instead, he’s trying to pull up the ladders behind him and get more contracts and, you know. And I think a lot of what he’s doing is ideologically motivated as he’s fallen down darker and darker right-wing rabbit holes on the platform he bought to derange himself.\n\nBut there’s something else there that could have happened. And it points to—and this is the thing I say that I do think is an addition to some of the stuff you’ve written in that New York Times essay—where the core of the populous right’s politics has to be scarcity. It just has to be. Because its first commitment is fewer immigrants. Its first commitment is that trade is a zero-sum game where there’s always a winner or a loser. Abundance is fundamentally positive sum, and the populist right is fundamentally negative sum, or at least zero-sum. There is nothing more fundamental to the way Donald Trump views the world than the things that are zero-sum negotiations. All of them. There’s always a winner and loser.\n\nAnd it’s just not how we see it. So he has to choose the pathway he’s choosing, because that is the dark engine of his politics, both here and in other countries. He didn’t invent this. This is something we’ve seen in many places, at many times. So electorally, then, I think you get into a couple questions. And look—there are a lot of electoral pathways that might work. And I don’t run in elections and win a lot of elections, but I’ve covered politics for a long time.\n\nOne thing that I do believe is just true is that you tend to win when you represent the future and not the past. And I think a really dangerous thing electorally for Democrats is that Donald Trump’s meaning has fundamentally changed since 2016. In 2016, he represented a kind of past against Hillary Clinton representing a different kind of past. And now he represents a future because Musk and RFK Jr. and Vance and Marc Andreessen—all of them together, the sort of flooding in of Rogan World—it has changed the meaning of Donald Trump from a defense of what there was to an idea about what’s coming.\n\nAnd I think they’re going to fuck that up, because they’re breaking things they don’t understand. You know, and if we don’t fall into autocracy, I think the backlash to the tariffs and everything else is going to be really profound. I could be wrong, obviously. But I think it is fundamental that Democrats are going to need to, if they’re going to be a successful political party, recapture a vision of the future.\n\nI mean, it’s a reason why in our book we put invention so at the core of things, right? We start with that slightly sci-fi vignette because we are trying to get people to imagine a future. This is about what world you are trying to build. And I think that is potent in American politics. I think that in politics, you need to have—to be as successful as you often want to be—a new vision.\n\nI think that you need to reorient politics around a divide that is healthier for you. Polarization is—the next question should always be, Well, what are we polarized over? Right? And is the nature of that cleavage good for us or bad for us? And I think one of the real cleavages right now is abundance and scarcity. And I think people have, like, underplayed this. They’ve wanted to say it’s sort of a moral regressiveness or an anti-institutionalism, right? Like, those are the things Donald Trump represents to liberals. He’s like a racist who hates the fundamental institutions of modern life. And that’s true in many ways. But it’s clearly not enough.\n\nAnd I think as Democrats begin to lose the future and lose the sense that they have a vision of what should be coming, that has become a really profound weakness. So what I’m looking for is, like, not just candidates who can sort of manage the politics-of-evasion problem and accept where Democrats get out of step with people, but candidates who can see some other way of organizing American politics, some other set of conflicts that are better for them and more constructive for the country than what we’ve had. And I think that, like, at a vibes level is what we are trying to offer. Like, a different way of cutting what this is all really about.\n\nThompson: Yeah. One way we sometimes talked about it is that American politics tends to be built on axes: Are you liberal or are you conservative? Are you proimmigrant or are you anti? Are you pro-DEI or are you anti? And we’re trying to introduce a new binary, a new axis here, which is abundance versus scarcity. And the reason why we’re trying to introduce this axis is not just because we think that axis is important, and it’s not just because we think that axis is illuminating to understand American policy and American economics. It’s also an axis on which liberals can win.\n\nWe’ve seen, I think, in the last few months that scarcity doesn’t just empower illiberal movements, as Jerusalem, that was the basis of your question. It’s also the case that scarcity empowers illiberal movements to pursue scarcity. I mean, look at what the Trump administration has done in the first few weeks. By saying, America can’t afford our debt—scarcity—we therefore cannot afford healthcare for the poor. More scarcity. Because America doesn’t have a healthy economy—scarcity—we have to accept American hardship—more deprivation. Because we don’t have enough manufacturing, we have to suffer the consequences of tariffs—scarcity for scarcity. Because we don’t have enough housing, we therefore need fewer immigrants. Oh, we don’t have enough of this, therefore we need less of that which we need. I mean, this is an argument of scarcity requiring scarcity, and it is an argument that we should be, as liberals, excited to take on, right?\n\nEvery administration invariably creates the conditions for its own opposition. Every single administration does this. That is the basis of thermostatic politics in America, and it’s the basis of thermostatic politics around the world. I think that liberals need both a negative identity and a positive identity. And this is my gloss, my wrapping paper on what Ezra just said: You need a negative identity, which is what you’re against, and you need a positive identity, which is what you’re for.\n\nIt’s obvious what the Democratic Party is against. Open any newspaper any day of the week: That’s what we’re against, right? Donald Trump is taking a wrecking ball to politics. Elon Musk is tweeting nonsense after nonsense on social media, while, at the same time, pretending he understands things that he’s absolutely demolishing. That, I think, goes catastrophically against American interests. The negative identity of the Democratic Party is incredibly clear. That is the unfortunate toxic gift of Donald Trump in power.\n\nBut what’s the positive identity? What are we actually for, beyond just being against Donald Trump? That’s where I think we need to offer a positive-sum vision, right? And that vision is what we call abundance. And it’s why, again, I think it’s really cool to have a book that is predominantly, in so many ways, a self-critique of the body of liberalism in America. But it begins with a sci-fi positive vision. Here’s what we’re aiming for. Here is our north star. This is what we want to build. Let’s see if we can get out of our way and build it.\n\nAnd of course, that requires winning elections against a movement that right now is dominated by Donald Trump. But I don’t think we need further clarification on how to be anti-Trump. I think we need further clarification on how to stand for something bigger than being anti-Trump.\n\nDemsas: So one thing I wanted to ask about—and I mean this: A big part of your book is about invention and about scientific innovation. We haven’t talked a lot about that. But one thing I think I wanted to ask about it is that it feels, in many ways, that the barriers hampering housing, transit, energy are different than the ones standing in the way of scientific innovation.\n\nI mean, in housing, we know how to build a house. Transit: We see high-speed rail. We see energy. We know how to build solar panels. These are things that other countries are building. Of course, there’s innovation that can happen in all of these spaces, and I appreciate all of the focus on productivity that you have in the book. But are the problems preventing scientific innovation—are those really in the same wheelhouse as these other baskets that you guys are focusing on?\n\nThompson: Some of them absolutely are, and some of them absolutely are not. You know, in one way, you can think about abundance as being a kind of three-part process. Part one is: You decide what the good is that you’re aiming for. What’s the positive vision?\n\nPart two is: You have to actually understand the market, the industry that is responsible for producing that vision. You have to understand local housing markets to figure out what’s wrong with housing. You have to understand clean-energy technology and siting rules in order to figure out how to build more clean energy. And in science and technology, you have to understand science markets and how scientific funding works and how the discovery process works.\n\nAnd then part three is: You remove the bottlenecks that are in the way. And sometimes that means taking things away, and sometimes it means adding things. So in the world of science, right, what we want are more lifesaving medical breakthroughs that add the most important thing in the world, which is more healthy years of life. And the difficult thing about science is that you don’t exactly know what you are aiming for specifically, because unlike building a house or unlike siting a solar farm, discoveries are, by their very nature, unknown before you discover them.\n\nSo what I did for this piece is try to figure out, Okay, what are the inputs to scientific breakthroughs? It’s smart people, it’s time, and it’s money. The problem that we identified with the National Institutes of Health is that we have created, over the last 60 years, a set of bureaucratic procedures and paperwork requirements. This created a situation where the typical scientist now spends his or her time filling out paperwork or filing grants and not doing actual science.\n\nI consider that to be an absolute catastrophe, and so do many scientists. And you can reframe the catastrophe this way: Imagine if we discovered one day in the near future that typical American scientists suffered from a virus that created a chronic-fatigue disorder that knocked out 40 percent of their working years, such that they had to sleep, say, between January and late May of every single year. We’d say, Well, obviously, this is an enormous crisis for American science. But in many cases, this is not an exogenous bacteria or virus. These are requirements in paperwork laws that we have created for ourselves and for our scientists.\n\nSo first, I want to find ways of experimenting with funding that reduces the paperwork requirements in ways that I see very similar as the benefits of reducing bureaucratic and paperwork requirements in, say, affordable-housing construction or broadband-internet construction with the Infrastructure Act under President Biden.\n\nSo there are some things that I think we want to take away and reform and streamline in ways that are totally similar to many earlier parts of the book. But also, I’m not a pure libertarian on this standpoint. I don’t think that the road to scientific abundance flows purely through just taking things away.\n\nI also think we need to create new programs and recognize, for example, the absolute wonder that Operation Warp Speed did. I mean, Operation Warp Speed truly is one of the most remarkable programs in modern American history because it was fantastically successful at producing a life-saving medical therapy, and also, in a weird way, has been abandoned by both the Democratic and Republican Parties.\n\nDemocrats don’t talk about it, because it’s a Trump initiative, and Republicans, I think, don’t talk about it because, in many cases, they’re an anti-vax movement. And so it’s been orphaned, but the lessons of Operation Warp Speed—the way it created incentives for scientists, the way it removes roadblocks for actually building therapies that you invent—I think are incredibly important if we want to create science that saves people’s lives and build that science into products that extends people’s lives.\n\nSo the way I see it, the message in science intervention is absolutely in keeping with the thrust of abundance. It depends on a positive vision. It depends on a very keen understanding of the market that’s relevant to making that vision a reality. And then it looks very clearly at: What are the bottlenecks to take away and what are the policies to add?\n\nDemsas: This talking about innovation and the failures inherent in the scientific process feels like a great time to ask our last and final question. Derek, let’s start with you. What is something that you originally thought was a good idea but ended up being only good on paper?\n\nThompson: When Laura and I had our first kid, we were getting a lot of advice from people about the need to put the baby first and the fact that, of course, when you have a baby, the baby is what suddenly must come first. And that sounded fantastic. It’s certainly something close to the cliché of what new parents are told, that something has been introduced to their life around which they have to reorient their life. And that’s absolutely true in so many ways.\n\nBut the truth is, the best advice that I got about being a parent was the exact opposite. I was talking to a friend, Brian, who said, I think my favorite parenting advice is, No. 1: Look out for yourself. No. 2: Look out for the relationship with your partner. And then No. 3: Look out for your child. If you’re not your best self, he won’t be the best possible partner. And if you’re not the best possible partnership, you won’t be good parents.\n\nSo in a weird way, the child comes last. And there’s something beautifully counterintuitive and lovely about that, about the need for and the benefit of a kind of wise selfishness in parenting. And I love that that goes slightly against the good-on-paper advice of when you have a baby, that new baby needs to be the pure and unassailable sun around which your solar system must orbit.\n\nDemsas: We get a lot of parenting responses in Good on Paper. Ezra, what’s yours?\n\nKlein: Ooh, I mean, I think before Derek gave that answer, I was going to give a very book-related answer about something about regulations or—not all regulations, but, you know, there’s certain categories of regulations and comment structures that I took just as generally good before that I don’t now.\n\nBut I’ll give a more personal one, so I don’t seem like a robot: Getting less sleep. For a lot of my life and definitely a lot of my career, my 20s as a journalist and early 30s maybe, probably particularly before I had kids, I was a very much, like, a sleep-is-a-cousin-of-death kind of person. And I would try to set the alarm earlier and earlier, and would just push through, and sort of felt that every hour I was spending asleep was an hour I wasn’t spending alive.\n\nAnd I really just now understand that to be the opposite. I had this one moment at some point where I thought I had been just kind of anxious for years, and maybe I was just tired. Like, maybe I just mixed up the two feelings, or the two feelings were just feeding into each other, certainly. And so now, I do not always succeed, because I have kids and a job and all the rest of it, but I really would like to get as much sleep as I possibly can as opposed to as little sleep as I can possibly get away with. And that has been a pretty big conceptual change.\n\n[Music]\n\nThompson: I would warn listeners: Don’t take these pieces of advice in the opposite order. Don’t try to sleepmax and then have a baby. That will lead to a little bit of priority confusion. Nonetheless, I do think that when you do have a kid, being protective of sleep is unbelievably important for all of the obvious reasons.\n\nDemsas: Well, thank you both for coming on the show. I’m so excited that this book is in the world. I’m so excited to continue this conversation with the both of you.\n\nKlein: Thank you, and for all your work here, which is hugely informative to what we ended up doing. Really, really appreciate it.\n\nThompson: Yeah. Thanks for being an inspiration.\n\nDemsas: Good on Paper is produced by Rosie Hughes.

        "title": "The Lesson Trump Is Learning the Hard Way",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The Founders knew that Americans, for better or worse, had an insatiable desire for overseas trade. “They are as aquatic as the tortoises and sea-fowl,” observed John Adams, “and the love of commerce, with its conveniences and pleasures, is a habit in them as unalterable as their natures.” As early as 1785 he foresaw that Americans would be compelled to form “connections with Europe, Asia, and Africa,” and he advised that “the sooner we form those connections into a judicious system, the better it will be for us and our children.” Thomas Jefferson would have preferred to cease all commerce with the rest of the world and rely on the simple virtues of the “yeoman farmer,” but he knew this was impossible. “Our people have a decided taste for navigation and commerce … and their servants are in duty bound to calculate all their measures on this datum.” Even that much-caricatured “Jacksonian,” Andrew Jackson himself, as president never fired a shot in anger but negotiated more trade agreements with foreign powers than any of his predecessors.\n\nThe American love of trade made using the practice as a weapon against other nations difficult. When Jefferson forgot his own lesson and tried to embargo trade with Great Britain in 1807 in response to the British navy’s abuse of American merchants on the high seas, his efforts backfired, stirring talk of secession in the New England states that conducted most of that trade. It turned out to be easier to get Americans to support a shooting war with Great Britain than a trade war.\n\nDonald Trump is now learning the hard way how vulnerable America is when it comes to trade wars. This is not because the United States doesn’t in theory hold the strongest hand. The American market is the most desired in the world, and any restriction on access to that market should hurt other countries more than it hurts the United States. The ratio of international trade to GDP for the U.S. is roughly 25 percent, compared with more than 60 percent on average for all other nations. In Germany, foreign trade tallies up to 90 percent of GDP. That ought to make the country vulnerable and give the United States leverage. In practice, however, Americans have proved time and again that they have a very low threshold of pain when it comes to trade wars. Jefferson was not wrong to believe that Britain depended heavily on American trade when he launched his embargo in 1807; what he did not anticipate was that his own citizens would cave before Britain did.\n\nRead: How Republicans learned to love high prices\n\nThe problem is, or at least has been up until now, democracy, and, more specifically, electoral politics in a federal system where narrow, local interests can have broad national political impact. A trade dispute might harm only one sector of the economy, but if that sector happens to coincide with a crucial voting bloc, it can put the United States at a disadvantage in a contest with a nominally weaker power.\n\nA good example of this came during World War I, before the United States had entered the war and Woodrow Wilson was trying to navigate his way through British blockades and German submarine attacks on transatlantic shipping while desperately trying to preserve American neutrality. The United States was far less reliant on international trade then; it was only 11 percent of GDP. But as Wilson learned, even damage to particular sectors of the economy could threaten political upheaval. Although his personal inclinations were pro-British, for instance, London’s threats to blockade cotton as contraband of war infuriated the Democrats’ key southern constituency. Wilson’s secretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, recalled spending “more sleepless nights thinking about cotton” than about anything else during his time in office. The rest of his sleepless nights were spent worrying about finding markets for midwestern grain, much of which had been purchased by Germany and other European nations prior to the war. These specific sectors, because they involved states and regions essential to national political coalitions, had influence on American decision making that exceeded their overall importance to the American economy.\n\nRead: Trump’s most inexplicable decision yet\n\nTrump must believe, as Jefferson did, that the world needs America more than America needs the world, and he may be right—in theory. The problem is that individual voting blocs mean more to him than carrying out a consistent trade war, as he has repeatedly demonstrated during both terms in office. In his first term, the damage done to farmers by his tariffs on imports was sufficiently threatening politically that he had to spend much of the money gained by the tariffs to compensate the farmers for their losses. His vacillations and emendations in his latest rounds of tariffs this year have been similarly motivated by his desire not to alienate Republican voters in particular states—northern-tier states that rely heavily on trade with Canada and automaking states that stand to lose badly from tariffs on auto parts, steel, and aluminum crossing the Mexican and Canadian borders. It is no accident that among the Europeans’ first retaliatory tariffs have been those against Harley-Davidson and American whiskey. Other nations may know their history better than Trump does and have figured out that tariffing sectors of the economy that hit Trump voters can have an impact beyond their dollar value. The United States is a nation split down the middle politically, so marginal voting groups can have a huge effect. This significantly vitiates the American advantage.\n\nIt would be one thing if Trump’s supporters were willing to suffer economic hardship in order to show their support for the MAGA way. As Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama put it, “There’s going to be some pain with tariffs,” but “no pain, no gain.” The problem for Trump is that, so far, as in the past, even his own voters don’t have much tolerance for pain.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "Later this week, the Trump administration may impose travel restrictions on citizens from dozens of countries, supposedly because of security concerns. According to early reports, one of the countries on the “red” list, from which all travel would be banned, is Afghanistan. Sixty thousand exhaustively vetted Afghan visa applicants and refugees, who risked their lives alongside the Americans in their country as interpreters, drivers, soldiers, judges, and journalists, and who now face imprisonment, torture, and death at the hands of the Taliban, will have the golden doors to the United States shut in their face.\n\nAs the Taliban closed in on Kabul in the summer of 2021, then-Senator Marco Rubio co-authored a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to “ensure the safety and security of Afghans who have worked closely” with American intelligence agencies: “Abandoning these individuals” would be “a stain on our national conscience.” After the Afghan government fell and tens of thousands of Afghans rushed to the Kabul airport, trying desperately to be evacuated with the last American troops, Rubio excoriated Biden for leaving Afghan allies behind to be killed. Then-Representative Mike Waltz warned that “our local allies are being hunted down.” Kash Patel accused the Biden administration of “the stranding of US personnel and allies.” The Republican majority of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in a damning report on the fall of Afghanistan, said that Biden’s “abandonment of our Afghan allies, who fought alongside the U.S. military against the Taliban—their brothers in arms—is a stain on [his] administration.”\n\nAs for then-ex-President Donald Trump, he was incredulous, telling Sean Hannity on Fox News: “We take the military out before we took our civilians out, and before we took the interpreters and others we want to try and help? But by the way, I’m America first. The Americans come out first. But we’re also going to help people that helped us.”\n\nOn Inauguration Day, President Trump signed executive orders pausing foreign aid and refugee processing. He turned off the flow of money to private agencies that helped Afghans start new lives in America and shut down the State Department office set up under Biden to oversee their resettlement. Since then, the number of Afghans able to enter the U.S. has dwindled to zero. The travel ban will make the halt official and permanent. All of the outrage at the Biden administration’s betrayal of our Afghan allies from the very Republicans who now command U.S. foreign policy will go down as sheer opportunism. The stain will be on them.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Biden’s ‘America First’ policy on Afghanistan\n\n“All these fucking people had a lot to say about what was going on in August 2021,” says Shawn VanDiver, a Navy veteran who leads AfghanEvac, a coalition of organizations that help resettle Afghan allies in this country. Politically, Biden never recovered from the chaotic fall of Kabul and the terrible scenes at the airport, climaxing in the suicide bombing at Abbey Gate that killed 13 American service members and 170 Afghans. Biden deserved blame above all for failing to take seriously America’s obligation to vulnerable Afghans who had placed their trust in this country. But during the years following the debacle, AfghanEvac and other civil-society groups worked with the Biden administration to bring nearly 200,000 Afghans to America—a little-known fact that partly redeemed its failures. Now Trump is compounding Biden’s earlier sins, this time in cold blood.\n\nVanDiver and his colleagues are scrambling to persuade their contacts inside the administration to exempt Afghans from the coming travel ban. Many of his military friends are stunned that the president they voted for is betraying Afghans they had to leave behind. “I wonder if President Trump knows that Stephen Miller is ruining his relationship with veterans because of what we’re doing to our Afghan allies,” he told me. According to VanDiver, Rubio and Waltz—now the secretary of state and the national security adviser, respectively—are sympathetic to the veterans’ appeal; but Miller, the hard-line homeland-security adviser, will have the final say with Trump.\n\nForty-five thousand Afghans have completed the onerous steps to qualify for Special Immigrant Visas as former employees of the U.S. government in Afghanistan and are ready to travel. Fifteen thousand more Afghans, most in Pakistan, have reached the end of refugee processing as close affiliates of the American war effort. They’ve been waiting through years of referrals, applications, interviews, medical exams, and security vetting. Some of them have plane tickets. Another 147,000 Afghans are well along in qualifying for Special Immigrant Visas.“We did make a promise as a nation to these people that if they stood beside the U.S. mission and worked with us, that they would have a pathway to come build lives here,” a State Department official, who requested anonymity because of a policy against speaking to journalists, told me. “If we don’t keep the promises we make to our wartime allies, then our standing globally should be questioned by any other future potential allies we might have.” Afghans who finally reach the United States, the official continued, “are so incredibly grateful to have the opportunity to be in this country. They believe in the promise of this country.”\n\nOne young Afghan couple—I’ll call them Farhad and Saman, because using their real names would expose them to danger—are both veterans of the Afghan special forces, and they spent years serving and fighting alongside U.S. Army Rangers and other special operators. After the American departure, they were hunted by Talibs and took shelter in safe houses around the country, while family members were harassed, arrested, and tortured. In 2023, with the help of a small group of American supporters, the couple crossed the border into Pakistan and found lodgings in Islamabad, where they waited with their small children for their refugee applications to be processed. Last summer they were interviewed by the U.S. embassy and passed their medical exams; but security screening took so long that, by the time it was completed, their medical exams had expired. On January 2 of this year, they passed their second medical exams and were told by the International Organization of Migration that they would soon depart for the United States. “But on January 24, we realized unfortunately that Donald Trump is in office and everything is stopped,” Farhad told me by phone. “It was at the very last minute, the last stage. I didn’t expect that this would happen. It made a very bad impact on me and my family.”\n\nGeorge Packer: The betrayal\n\nRecently, stepped-up Pakistani police patrols and raids made the couple flee Islamabad to another region. Their 3-year-old daughter and infant son don’t have visas, and Farhad’s and Saman’s visas expire on April 17, with no prospect of renewal. Fear of being stopped at a checkpoint keeps the family inside their small apartment almost all the time, while their daughter wonders when she’ll be able to start school. They ask neighbors to buy food for them at the bazaar. The Pakistani government has begun to issue warnings over loudspeakers at mosques that local people who rent property to Afghan refugees will face legal consequences. “I’m stressed that the U.S. government is not going to relocate us and will not help us to continue processing our case,” Farhad said. He has sent letters of inquiry to embassies of other countries, with no reply. “I’m worried that eventually somehow I’ll be deported to Afghanistan, and deportation means I’ll be caught by the Taliban and killed. My wife will not be excluded. She will face the same consequences. I’m overwhelmed sometimes when I think what will happen to my kids—they’ll be orphans. It’s too much for me to take in.”\n\nWhen Republican leaders were shaming the Biden administration for abandoning this country’s Afghan allies, they sometimes used the military phrase brothers in arms. Now, as those same Republicans in the Trump administration are betraying the same Afghans all over again, Farhad used the phrase with me. “I fought like brothers in arms with the Americans in uniform for six years, shoulder to shoulder, everywhere,” he said. “If this travel ban happens, the question is, what about the six years of friendship and fighting together? What about helping your friends and allies? That’s the question I have.”",

        "content": "On May 17, 1954, a nervous 45-year-old lawyer named Thurgood Marshall took a seat in the Supreme Court’s gallery. The founder and director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund hoped to learn that he had prevailed in his pivotal case. When Chief Justice Earl Warren announced the Court’s opinion in Brown v. Board of Education, Marshall could not have known that he had also won what is still widely considered the most significant legal decision in American history. Hearing Warren declare “that in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place” delivered Marshall into a state of euphoria. “I was so happy, I was numb,” he said. After exiting the courtroom, he joyously swung a small boy atop his shoulders and galloped around the austere marble hall. Later, he told reporters, “It is the greatest victory we ever had.”\n\nExplore the April 2025 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nFor Marshall, the “we” who triumphed in Brown surely referred not only, or even primarily, to himself and his Legal Defense Fund colleagues, but to the entire Black race, on whose behalf they’d toiled. And Black Americans did indeed find Brown exhilarating. Harlem’s Amsterdam News, echoing Marshall, called Brown “the greatest victory for the Negro people since the Emancipation Proclamation.” W. E. B. Du Bois stated, “I have seen the impossible happen. It did happen on May 17, 1954.” When Oliver Brown learned of the outcome in the lawsuit bearing his surname, he gathered his family near, and credited divine providence: “Thanks be to God for this.” Martin Luther King Jr. encouraged Montgomery’s activists in 1955 by invoking Brown: “If we are wrong, then the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong.” Many Black people viewed the opinion with such awe and reverence that for years afterward, they threw parties on May 17 to celebrate Brown’s anniversary.\n\nOver time, however, some began questioning what exactly made Brown worthy of celebration. In 1965, Malcolm X in his autobiography voiced an early criticism of Brown: It had yielded precious little school desegregation over the previous decade. Calling the decision “one of the greatest magical feats ever performed in America,” he contended that the Court’s “masters of legal phraseology” had used “trickery and magic that told Negroes they were desegregated—Hooray! Hooray!—and at the same time … told whites ‘Here are your loopholes.’ ”\n\nRead: The children who desegregated America’s schools\n\nBut that criticism paled in comparison with the anti-Brown denunciation in Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton’s Black Power: The Politics of Liberation two years later. They condemned not Brown’s implementation, but its orientation. The fundamental aim of integration must be abandoned because it was driven by the “assumption that there is nothing of value in the black community,” they maintained.\n\nTo sprinkle black children among white pupils in outlying schools is at best a stop-gap measure. The goal is not to take black children out of the black community and expose them to white middle-class values; the goal is to build and strengthen the black community.\n\nAlthough Black skeptics of the integration ideal originated on the far left, Black conservatives—including the economist Thomas Sowell—have more recently ventured related critiques. The most prominent example is Marshall’s successor on the Supreme Court, Justice Clarence Thomas. In 1995, four years after joining the Court, Thomas issued a blistering opinion that opened, “It never ceases to amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume that anything that is predominantly black must be inferior.”\n\nThe Brown decision, Rooks writes, should be viewed as “an attack on Black schools, politics, and communities.”\n\nDesperate efforts to promote school integration, Thomas argued, stemmed from the misperception that identifiably Black schools were somehow doomed to fail because of their racial composition. “There is no reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when surrounded by members of their own race as when they are in an integrated environment,” he wrote. Taking a page from Black Power’s communal emphasis, Thomas argued that “black schools can function as the center and symbol of black communities, and provide examples of independent black leadership, success, and achievement.” In a 2007 opinion, he extolled Washington, D.C.’s all-Black Dunbar High School—which sent dozens of graduates to the Ivy League and its ilk during the early 20th century—as a paragon of Black excellence.\n\nIn the 2000s, as Brown crept toward its 50th anniversary, Derrick Bell of the NYU School of Law went so far as to allege that the opinion had been wrongly decided. For Bell, who had sharpened his skills as an LDF lawyer, Brown’s “integration ethic centralizes whiteness. White bodies are represented as somehow exuding an intrinsic value that percolates into the ‘hearts and minds’ of black children.” Warren’s opinion in the case should have affirmed Plessy v. Ferguson’s “separate but equal” regime, Bell wrote, but it should have insisted on genuine equality of expenditures, rather than permitting the sham equality of yore that consigned Black students to shoddy classrooms in dilapidated buildings. He acknowledged, though, that his jaundiced account put him at odds with dominant American legal and cultural attitudes: “The Brown decision,” he noted, “has become so sacrosanct in law and in the beliefs of most Americans that any critic is deemed wrongheaded, even a traitor to the cause.”\n\nIn her New Book, Integrated: How American Schools Failed Black Children, Noliwe Rooks adds to a growing literature that challenges the portrayal of the decision as “a significant civil rights–era win.” Rooks, the chair of the Africana-​studies department at Brown University, offers an unusual blend of historical examination and family memoir that generally amplifies the concerns articulated by prior desegregation discontents. The result merits careful attention not for its innovative arguments, but as an impassioned, arresting example of how Brown skepticism, which initially gained traction on the fringes of Black life, has come to hold considerable appeal within the Black intellectual mainstream.\n\nAs recently as midway through the first Trump administration, Rooks would have placed herself firmly in the traditional pro-Brown camp, convinced that addressing racial inequality in education could best be pursued through integration. But traveling a few years ago to promote a book that criticized how private schools often thwart meaningful racial integration, she repeatedly encountered audience members who disparaged her core embrace of integration. Again and again, she heard from Black parents that “the trauma their children experienced in predominantly white schools and from white teachers was sometimes more harmful than the undereducation occurring in segregated schools.”\n\nFrom the May 2018 issue: The report on race that shook America\n\nThe onslaught dislodged Rooks’s faith in the value of contemporary integration, and even of Brown itself. She now exhibits the convert’s zeal. Brown, she writes, should be viewed as “an attack on Black schools, politics, and communities, which meant it was an attack on the pillars of Black life.” For some Black citizens, the decision acted as “a wrecking ball that crashed through their communities and, like a pendulum, continues to swing.”\n\nRooks emphasizes the plight of Black educators, who disproportionately lost their positions in Brown’s aftermath because of school consolidations. Before Brown, she argues, “Black teachers did not see themselves as just teaching music, reading, or science, but also as activists, organizers, and freedom fighters who dreamed of and fought for an equitable world for future generations”; they served as models who showed “Black children how to fight for respect and societal change.”\n\nEndorsing one of Black Power’s analogies, she maintains that school integration meant that “as small a number as possible of Black children were, like pepper on popcorn, lightly sprinkled atop wealthy, white school environments, while most others were left behind.” Even for those ostensibly fortunate few flecks of pepper, Rooks insists, providing the white world’s seasoning turned out to be a highly uncertain, dangerous endeavor. She uses her father’s disastrous experiences with integration to examine what she regards as the perils of the entire enterprise. After excelling in all-Black educational environments, including as an undergraduate at Howard University, Milton Rooks became one of a very small number of Black students to enroll at the Golden Gate University School of Law in the early 1960s.\n\nSent by his hopeful parents “over that racial wall,” Milton encountered hostility from white professors, who doubted his intellectual capacity, Rooks recounts, and “spit him back up like a piece of meat poorly digested.” She asserts that the ordeal not only prompted him to drop out of law school but also spurred his descent into alcoholism. Rooks extrapolates further, writing:\n\nMilton’s experience reflected the trauma Black students suffered as they desegregated public schools in states above the Mason-Dixon Line, where displays of racism were often mocking, disdainful, pitying, and sword sharp in their ability to cut the unsuspecting into tiny bits. It destroyed confidence, shook will, sowed doubt, murdered souls—quietly, sure, but still as completely as could a mob of white racists setting their cowardice, rage, and anger loose upon the defenseless.\n\nThe harms that contemporary integrated educational environments inflict upon Black students can be tantamount, in her view, to the harms imposed upon the many Black students who are forced to attend monoracial, woeful urban high schools. To make this point, Rooks recounts her own struggle to correct the misplacement of her son, Jelani, in a low-level math class in Princeton, New Jersey’s public-school system during the aughts (when she taught at Princeton University). She witnessed other Black parents meet with a similar lack of support in guiding their children to the academically demanding courses that could propel them to elite colleges. In Jelani’s case, she had evidence that teachers’ “feelings were hardening against him.” He led a life of relative safety and economic privilege, and felt at ease among his white classmates and friends, she allows, even as she also stresses that what he “experienced wasn’t the violence of poverty; it was something else equally devastating”:\n\nWe knew that poor, working-class, or urban communities were not the only places where Black boys are terrorized and traumatized. We knew that the unfamiliarity of his white friends with any other Black people would one day become an issue in our home. We knew that guns were not the only way to murder a soul.\n\nFrustrated with Princeton’s public schools, Rooks eventually enrolled Jelani in an elite private high school where, she notes, he also endured racial harassment—and from which he graduated before making his way to Amherst College.\n\nseven decades have now elapsed since the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown. Given the stubbornly persistent phenomenon of underperforming predominantly Black schools throughout the nation, arguing that Brown’s potential has been fully realized would be absurd. Regrettably, the Warren Court declined to advance the most powerful conception of Brown when it had the opportunity to do so: Its infamously vague “all deliberate speed” approach allowed state and local implementation to be delayed and opposed for far too long. In its turn, the Burger Court provided an emaciated conception of Brown’s meaning, one that permitted many non-southern jurisdictions to avoid pursuing desegregation programs. Rooks deftly sketches this lamentable, sobering history.\n\nFrom the May 2014 issue: Segregation now ...\n\nDisenchantment with Brown’s educational efficacy is thus entirely understandable. Yet to suggest that the Supreme Court did not go far enough, fast enough in galvanizing racially constructive change in American schools after Brown is one thing. To suggest that Brown somehow took a wrong turn is quite another.\n\nRooks does not deny that integration succeeded in narrowing the racial achievement gap. But like other Brown critics, she nevertheless idealizes the era of racial segregation. Near Integrated ’s conclusion, Rooks contends that “too few of us have a memory of segregated Black schools as the beating heart of vibrant Black communities, enabling students to compose lives of harmony, melody, and rhythm and sustained Black life and dignity.” But this claim gets matters exactly backwards. The brave people who bore segregation’s brunt believed that Jim Crow represented an assault on Black life and dignity, and that Brown marked a sea change in Black self-conceptions.\n\nDesegregation’s detractors routinely elevate the glory days of D.C.’s Dunbar High School, but they refuse to heed the lessons of its most distinguished graduates. Charles Hamilton Houston—Dunbar class of 1911, who went on to become valedictorian at Amherst and the Harvard Law Review’s first Black editor—nevertheless dedicated his life to eradicating Jim Crow as an NAACP litigator and Thurgood Marshall’s mentor in his work contesting educational segregation. Sterling A. Brown—Dunbar class of 1918, who graduated from Williams College before becoming a distinguished poet and professor—nevertheless wrote the following in 1944, one decade before Brown:\n\nNegroes recognize that the phrase “equal but separate accommodations” is a myth. They have known Jim Crow a long time, and they know Jim Crow means scorn and not belonging.\n\nMuch as they valued having talented, caring teachers, these men understood racial segregation intimately, and they detested it.\n\nIn the 1990s, Nelson B. Rivers III, an unheralded NAACP official from South Carolina, memorably heaved buckets of cold water on those who were beginning to wonder, “ Was integration the right thing to do? Was it worth it? Was Brown a good decision?” Rivers dismissed such questions as “asinine,” and continued:\n\nTo this day, I can remember bus drivers pulling off and blowing smoke in my mother’s face. I can remember the back of the bus, colored water fountains … I can hear a cop telling me, “Take your black butt back to nigger town.” What I tell folk … is that there are a lot of romanticists now who want to take this trip down Memory Lane, and they want to go back, and I tell the young people that anybody who wants to take you back to segregation, make sure you get a round-trip ticket because you won’t stay.\n\nNostalgia for the pre-Brown era would not exercise nearly so powerful a grip on Black America today if its adherents focused on its detailed, pervasive inhumanities rather than relying on gauzy glimpses.\n\nNo one has pressed this point more vividly than Robert L. Carter, who worked alongside Marshall at the LDF before eventually becoming a distinguished federal judge. He understood that to search for Brown’s impact exclusively in the educational domain is mistaken. Instead, he emphasized that Brown fomented a broad-gauge racial revolution throughout American public life. Despite Chief Justice Warren formally writing the opinion to apply exclusively to education, its attack on segregation has—paradoxically—been most efficacious beyond that original context.\n\nFrom the October 1967 issue: Jonathan Kozol’s ‘Where Ghetto Schools Fail’\n\n“The psychological dimensions of America’s race relations problem were completely recast” by Brown, Carter wrote. “Blacks were no longer supplicants seeking, pleading, begging to be treated as full-fledged members of the human race; no longer were they appealing to morality, to conscience, to white America’s better instincts,” he noted. “They were entitled to equal treatment as a right under the law; when such treatment was denied, they were being deprived—in fact robbed—of what was legally theirs. As a result, the Negro was propelled into a stance of insistent militancy.”\n\nEven within the educational sphere, though, it is profoundly misguided to claim that Black students who attend solid, meaningfully integrated schools encounter environments as corrosive as, or worse than, those facing students trapped in ghetto schools. This damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t analysis suggests an entire cohort stuck in the same boat, when its many members are not even in the same ocean. The Black student marooned in a poor and violent neighborhood, with reason to fear actual murder, envies the Black student attending a rigorous, integrated school who worries about metaphorical “soul murder.” All struggles are not created equal.\n\nThis article appears in the April 2025 print edition with the headline “Was Integration the Wrong Goal?”",

        "content": "I need you to watch this 13-second video of ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith walking to his courtside seat at a Los Angeles Lakers game. I need you to notice how Smith, perhaps the biggest voice in sports—in sheer decibels, if not reach—savors the see-and-be-seen pleasures of the courtside experience. That was two years ago. Now imagine how he might have floated into the Lakers’ home arena the night of March 6. Only hours earlier, it had been reported that ESPN had agreed to a new contract with Smith worth more than $100 million. To celebrate, Smith’s agent, Ari Emanuel, had invited him to the game. Larry David would join them courtside, near the end of the Lakers bench. This should have been the perfect atmosphere for Smith to revel in his ascent to the pinnacle of sports media. Instead, his night took a bad turn.\n\nEarly in the game, Smith made eye contact with Bronny James, a rookie reserve guard on the Lakers and, crucially, the son of the Lakers’ star LeBron James. Bronny has had a rough season. He has been dogged by accusations that he would not be playing in the NBA were it not for his last name. On the road, opposing crowds engage in mocking chants, begging the Lakers coach to put him in. In January, he had his worst game of the season; in 15 minutes, he missed all of his shots and turned the ball over three times. The next morning, on First Take, ESPN’s flagship morning show, Smith made Bronny the subject of one of his trademark rants. For more than four uninterrupted minutes, he pleaded with LeBron—as a father—to stop exposing his son. “Stop this,” he said. “Stop this.”\n\nLeBron does not seem to have taken kindly to Smith’s unsolicited counsel. At the March 6 game, near the end of the third quarter, he approached Smith in his courtside seat. Looming over Smith in a manner that does not usually accompany friendly chatter, he barked something. His exact words can’t be heard in a fan video of the encounter, but his menacing tone is legible. According to Smith’s account of the exchange, LeBron said, “Stop fucking with my son. That’s my son.”\n\nSmith did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did LeBron, so the details of what he said that night are unconfirmed. But even going by the body language and by related comments that LeBron later made on a hot mic, it does appear that his goal was to intimidate. By confronting Smith, LeBron sent a message not just to Smith but also to members of the wider NBA press corps, few of whom have Smith’s stature and influence: Criticize my son, and there will be consequences. Like many rich and powerful people, LeBron seems to want the fruits of global media stardom for himself and his kids, but not the corresponding scrutiny.\n\nLeBron has himself to blame for the sad media spectacle of Bronny’s first season. In the months leading up to last year’s NBA draft, Bronny told reporters that it was his life’s great dream to be drafted by a pro team, any team. In off-the-record interviews, league executives made clear that because Bronny does not have his dad’s skill or size, he wasn’t all that draftable. In his short career at the University of Southern California, which was interrupted by a scary incident of cardiac arrest, he averaged only five points a game.\n\nBy all appearances, it was LeBron who made sure Bronny got drafted, first by puffing him up, saying publicly that his son was already better than many active NBA players. LeBron also made it known that he himself would play for whichever team drafted Bronny. (No prospect has ever been packaged so attractively, with the NBA’s first or second all-time best player as a throw-in.) On draft day, the Lakers selected Bronny in the second round. That night, Bronny shed tears; his dream had come true. At a press conference a few days later, the team’s coach, JJ Redick, tried to quiet any doubts. Bronny had earned the pick, he said, with hard work.\n\nAt the time, some of LeBron’s critics saw this as contemptible. I wasn’t one of them. Why appoint yourself to the meritocracy police just to make LeBron and his son your first arrests? LeBron’s own father was never in his life. He was still sleeping on friends’ couches late into his childhood. Parenthood means something deep to him; he has described playing with his son as the biggest accomplishment of a career that includes four NBA titles and four MVP awards. There was something beautiful about him using the leverage that he’s amassed in the basketball world to make that happen, by dragging his first-born boy into the league. Was it nepotism? Sure, but human life is shot through with all kinds of advantages of birth, and Bronny’s didn’t seem the most important or unfair.\n\nLeBron deserves some empathy, even in the way he dealt with Smith. Nearly all parents experience something akin to his naive desire, a wish to give their kid the future of their dreams while shielding them from pain and disappointment. LeBron may have felt some anguish as he watched his son this season. Few things are as excruciating as watching your kids suffer. No amount of money or fame can insure against it. LeBron may well be haunted by his role in bringing about that suffering.\n\nBut even one of the greatest athletes of our age doesn’t—and certainly shouldn’t—have the power to protect his adult son from criticism. Indeed, what power LeBron has derives from the intense public curiosity about him as a basketball player and as a person. He was able to conjure a plus-one for a family member on an NBA roster precisely because he has been the league’s main character for a generation now. The media were always going to be interested in Bronny’s performance on the court, even if he’d made it there according to his own ability—and all the more so because he seemingly did not.\n\nRead: The secret code of pickup basketball\n\nLeBron has had more exposure to the NBA’s media ecosystem than any other active player. He knows that it rewards viral rants that lionize or denigrate a player based on their most recent game. And he should have known that Bronny would not be exempt from that dynamic, no matter how fiercely his father was protecting him.\n\nNow, by appearing to threaten Smith, LeBron has not only acted like a petty strongman; he has drawn new attention to his son’s disappointing season, enlarging the very story that he sought to suppress. It’s a rare misstep for someone so media-savvy, who has amassed an enormous personal fortune while staying almost entirely scandal-free across a long career that began when he was still a teenager. The mistake is, perhaps, understandable. The emotions of parenthood are gigantic. They can knock anyone off their game, even the great LeBron James.\n\nIllustration Sources: Tim Heitman / Getty; Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times via Getty; Nathaniel S. Butler / Getty",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "He was one of the few ICU patients whose face I saw in early 2021, when COVID raged through Los Angeles. As a palliative-care physician, my job was to meet, over Zoom, with the families of intubated patients to ensure that they had complete medical updates and to help them make difficult medical decisions on behalf of their loved one, particularly when that person faced death. But in a surreal departure from my usual practice, I’d never once seen these patients myself: At the time, to minimize exposure to COVID, the only people permitted to enter the ICU regularly were members of the ICU team.\n\nThis particular patient had survived several risky surgeries the year before; he’d returned to the hospital that winter after he became short of breath and began to gasp for air, his wife panicking as she watched his lips turn blue. He’d quickly required intubation and medications to increase his dangerously low blood pressure. His wife told me that during his many previous illnesses, she had slept every night in his hospital room, making sure he asked for pain medications and watching movies with him to pass the time. “He fought harder to live when I was there,” she told me.\n\nI dreaded explaining to her, and to all my patients’ families, that our hospital would allow a visit only if a patient became irreparably sick; even then, just one family member, unrecognizably ensconced in layers of PPE, could spend 10 minutes in their room before a physician removed life support. I struggled to tell those families that many of my patients still died alone, their condition sometimes worsening too suddenly and unpredictably for a loved one to arrive in time.\n\nThe tragedy of people suffering and dying alone is one of the enduring and unaddressed traumas of the pandemic. During early surges, we restricted visits to stop COVID from spreading. Yet even when the number of infections dropped and rates of transmission slowed, many of these strict policies remained in place, despite the immense damage they did to patients, families, and hospital staff.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people in the United States died from the disease in those first few years, and many of them died isolated from their friends and family. Intubated and unconscious, they may not have known they were alone, but their family members did, and many developed PTSD. Around the world, ICU staff, too, became distraught and demoralized by caring for an onslaught of people dying in isolation.\n\nSome states have since passed laws codifying families’ rights to visit loved ones in the hospital, but for the most part, this phenomenon has been treated as a painful memory, not something worthy of public conversation. Yet only by facing the ways that the separation of patients and families reshaped the human experiences of grief and loss can we understand why we must do better next time.\n\nIn late 2020 and early 2021, Los Angeles experienced a version of what New York faced at the beginning of the pandemic: a terrifying and rapid onslaught of COVID cases. Lines of ambulances wound around packed hospitals; vital oxygen and ventilators dwindled in the hardest-hit areas. Within the hospital, because of social-distancing mandates, my team and I could no longer share an office, and I’d leave work having interacted directly with a few patients outside the ICU and a handful of colleagues. When I left, I drove through streets lined with darkened storefronts, emptied of cars and people. Governor Gavin Newsom had reinstated stay-at-home orders for all regions with less than 15 percent of ICU beds open.\n\nAt the time, and during the worst stretches of the pandemic, numbers became our singular focus at the hospital: The number of vaccinated people, remaining ventilators, and local COVID cases all shaped how we cared for the sick and protected staff. Family members suddenly became visitors, and visitors were vectors. And despite witnessing the tragedy of isolated people dying or experiencing illness alone, I resigned myself to the fact that there was no other way to contain viral spread, particularly when COVID infections among hospital staff rose.\n\nBut as the months passed, the gains of limiting visitation dimmed as the human cost of preventing family from visiting sick relatives became clearer. In recent years, medical practitioners have recognized that families are not merely a comforting presence but also integral parts of care teams who might help us understand how a person with dementia expresses pain, or how to persuade a stubborn person to participate in physical therapy. Relegating their visits to life’s end felt disrespectful to them and to my patients.\n\nThe scenes from my day that began to haunt me, even when I tried to distract myself after work, were of people enduring the consequences of facing illness alone, forcibly separated from their loved ones. In the hospital courtyard, I’d consoled the frightened teenage daughters of a single father and brought in family photos they’d framed for him as he underwent chemotherapy. An older patient with dementia had needed strong medications and restraints to treat delirium, which her husband told me she had never required when he was at her bedside. A gentleman with emphysema had wept, fearing that without his wife he wouldn’t be able to alert a nurse if he couldn’t breathe. The pandemic destroyed the rituals of funerals and memorials, but it also destroyed the rite of helping a loved one through illness.\n\nAnd when life’s end approaches, I’ve seen over and over again the specific consolation that accompanying a person to their death can offer. Experiencing a loved one’s care together, attending to needs that only kin know, understanding that you were there with them as they faced the ultimate unknown, allows for a sense of agency amid circumstances rife with powerlessness and uncertainty. Before the pandemic, I’d observed how witnessing the details of a person’s illness profoundly helped families tell a story about a loved one’s final days or hours—about applying ChapStick to your father’s drying lips when he could no longer swallow water, or holding your brother’s hand as nausea from an inoperable brain tumor overwhelmed him, or playing music to ease your partner’s confusion as she died from kidney failure.\n\nInstead, the families I worked with during the pandemic understood their loved one’s illness only through the words of masked care teams whose faces they never saw. Over iPads, we could offer only momentary glimpses of their beloved, pointing out the purpose of each machine surrounding them. Deprived of the sensory experience of seeing illness unfold or watching treatment fail, families struggled to make urgent decisions and to come to terms with medicine’s limited ability to reverse COVID’s many devastations.\n\nHospitals certainly had an obligation to protect staff from COVID infections; especially early in the pandemic, when PPE was limited and no one knew much about this new virus’s behavior, limiting visitors was necessary. During the surge in early 2021, most hospitals generally had sufficient PPE, and physicians had a better understanding of the virus, but many of my colleagues still became exposed and infected. Whether they had contracted the virus within or outside the hospital was not entirely clear. If family members agreed to wear PPE at all times and to present a negative COVID-test result, perhaps they could have been allowed to visit while minimizing the risk of infecting staff. (Some research has suggested that adequate PPE reduced the risk of transmission, but there aren’t enough studies to determine whether limiting visitors protected staff from infections.)\n\nEvery hospital had its own policies, but sometimes even when visitors had been vaccinated or had tested negative for COVID, visitation rules didn’t change. I often wonder whether this may have been different had more of us on the front lines insisted more forcefully that minimizing deaths wasn’t the same as minimizing suffering, that the emotional aftermath of these decisions, which weren’t always modified even when schools and businesses reopened, had indelibly altered our own lives and those of patients and families.\n\nThe alternative to no visitors doesn’t have to be no rules: When legislators have tried to codify visitation rights, in many cases they’ve allowed for at least one designated visitor, for at least one hour a day, while also respecting hospital policies to enforce safety measures to ensure infection prevention. Yet as accounts of the human toll of strict visitation policies began to emerge, hospital administrators could have asked themselves, and their staff, earlier and more often about ways to accommodate visitation while also taking all possible measures to minimize COVID transmission. Without that grace, the extreme version of traumatic loss that patients’ families and medical teams were forced to experience continued, unabated.\n\nWhen a person can only imagine scenes and invent details of a death, they may face the kind of ambiguous loss first used to describe the experiences of families whose loved ones had gone missing in Vietnam. Living both with the fact of a death and without any details or evidence of what led to it can keep the loss from seeming truly real. Ambiguity haunts every loss to some degree, but these deaths in isolation denied families the opportunity even to try to witness the unfolding of illness and their loved ones’ last moments.\n\nImagine seeing, as my patient’s wife did, mere images of a ventilator, bags of antibiotics, and blood-pressure medications hanging from a pole above the person she loved. Imagine only hearing about how he shook from fevers and thrashed about amid spells of confusion. The ICU resident and I pointed out the way his skin had turned sallow, his arms newly marbled by bruises. Even with the maximum support from the ventilator, his lungs struggled to maintain a normal oxygen level, and his heart couldn’t pump blood efficiently, causing his legs to swell and several of his toes to turn blue. But describing all of this, or telling her that blood had begun to pool in his mouth, could not stand in for her experiencing his deterioration herself—pressing her hands against his newly unrecognizable limbs or seeing his lips newly crusted with crimson scabs.\n\nI remember him so well because I had to enter the ICU briefly to speak with a colleague, and his was the first room on my right. I had seen him, as his family had, only through the camera of the iPad used in family meetings; I gasped at the shock of seeing for myself the sharp angles of his face, his dusky toes, and the blood streaking his breathing tube. Nearly two weeks after he first arrived in our ICU, his heart, lungs, and kidneys were all failing. He was dying. And so his wife, who agreed that he wouldn’t want to live this way, on life support, could finally visit.\n\nI learned later that I had just left the hospital when she arrived in the ICU. She wanted to remove her gloves to press his hands into hers, one final time. This, unfortunately, wasn’t allowed, his nurse said. She stepped out of the room for a few minutes to give my patient and his wife privacy. When she returned, my patient’s wife had disappeared. He died half an hour later.\n\nOver the next few days, I called his wife several times, though she never returned my calls. I tried to imagine what might have happened in the minutes she saw her husband for the last time. Perhaps she obeyed the rules. I like to imagine a different scene: Perhaps, in a final, defiant act of love, she removed her gloves, kissed her husband’s hands, and smoothed his hair before slipping out, unnoticed, preparing herself to live in a world without him.",

        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "After spending most of the 2024 campaign blaming Democrats for inflation and insisting that tariffs don’t increase prices, Donald Trump and his allies have a new economic message: High prices are good.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, for example, recently admitted to the Economic Club of New York that inflation-weary Americans could see a “one-time price adjustment” from Trump’s tariffs, but he quickly added that “access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream.” Representative Mark Alford of Missouri told CNN, “We all have a role to play in this to rightsize our government, and if I have to pay a little bit more for something, I’m all for it to get America right again.” And Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick put his own spin on the argument, telling NBC News that, yes, prices on imports will rise, but American-made goods will get cheaper, and that’s what matters. (In fact, tariffs generally lead to price increases for imported and domestic goods, because the latter face less foreign-price competition.)\n\nIt’s true that affordable goods and services are not, on their own, the definition of the American dream. But they’re a necessary component of it, and trade is one of the most important drivers of that affordability. Until recently, Republicans understood this quite well.\n\nAmerican workers are also American consumers who must devote a sizable chunk of their income to essential goods such as clothing, food, shelter, and energy—goods made cheaper and more plentiful by international trade. Produce and clothing from Latin America, lumber and energy from Canada, footwear and electronics from Asia, wine and cheese from Europe: All of these and more help Americans stretch their paychecks and live happier, healthier lives. Thanks to the internet, moreover, we benefit from internationally traded services too, whether it’s an online tutor in Pakistan, a personal trainer in London, a help-desk employee in India, or an accountant in the Philippines. And we gain from better or cheaper domestic goods and services that are forced to compete with imports on quality or price.\n\nOverall, studies conservatively estimate that American households save thousands of dollars a year from the lower prices, increased variety, and global competition fomented by international trade. This increased purchasing power means not only that Americans have more “stuff” but also that their inflation-adjusted incomes are higher. As we just learned the hard way, bigger numbers on your paycheck mean nothing if you’re forced to spend even more on the things you need and want. In fact, one of the big reasons Americans’ inflation-adjusted wages have climbed in recent decades is that the exorbitant prices of things such as housing, health care, and education have been offset by significant declines for tradable goods such as toys, clothing, and consumer electronics. Money left over can also be saved for a rainy day or invested in things such as education and retirement.\n\nRogé Karma: Trump’s most inexplicable decision yet\n\nThe counterargument—until recently associated with the political left—is that cheap and varied consumer goods are not worth sacrificing the strength of America’s domestic-manufacturing sector. Even if we accept that (questionable) premise, however, it doesn’t justify Trump’s tariffs, because those tariffs will hurt domestic manufacturing too. About half of U.S. imports are intermediate goods, raw materials, and capital equipment that American manufacturers use to make their products and sell them here and abroad. Contrary to conventional wisdom, these imports increase domestic-manufacturing output and jobs. Thus, for example, an expanding U.S. trade deficit in automotive goods has long coincided with gains in domestic automotive output and production capacity, and past U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum caused a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing output. Even if domestic manufacturers don’t buy imported parts, simply having access to them serves as an important competitive check on the prices of made-in-America manufacturing inputs. This is why Trump’s recent steel-tariff announcement gave U.S. steelmakers a “green light to lift prices,” as The Wall Street Journal put it.\n\nImports such as construction materials, medical goods, and computers also support many U.S. service industries. And imports are important for leisure and economic mobility. By trading for necessities instead of making them ourselves, Americans have more free time to use for fun or self-improvement (and more disposable income to pursue such things). According to a new study in the Journal of International Economics, “between 1950 and 2014, trade openness contributed to an additional 20 to 95 hours of leisure per worker per year”—invaluable time we can devote to entertainment, family, community, or education.\n\n“Access to cheap goods” isn’t the American dream, but it sure helps us achieve it. This is particularly true for low-income workers who have tight budgets and little leisure time. Shelter, food, transport, utilities, and clothes accounted for approximately 68 percent of the poorest 20 percent of U.S. households’ annual expenditures but just about half of the richest 20 percent of households’ spending. It’s easy for someone worth, say, $521 million, like Bessent, to pay a few bucks more for everyday goods and still achieve his goals and ambitions; it’s far more difficult for a single mom with four kids to do the same.\n\nDemocrats used to be the ones offering a false choice between Americans’ access to affordable (often imported) stuff and our economic well-being. In 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama told a union-sponsored-debate audience in Chicago that “people don’t want a cheaper T‑shirt if they’re losing a job in the process.” And Bernie Sanders famously said in 2015 that Americans “don’t necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or of 18 different pairs of sneakers when children are hungry in this country.”\n\nBack in those days, Republicans defended the link between trade and American prosperity. Today, only a few party outcasts, such as Mike Pence, dare to do so. Trump’s allies have made very clear that they are trying to achieve a dream. It just isn’t America’s.",

        "content": "Donald Trump has promised a “golden age of America.” But for all his bluster about being the champion of an American century, Trump’s actual policies point to something different: not an expansive vision of the future, but a shrunken vision of the present.\n\nThroughout the opening months of his administration, the Trump White House has consistently pointed to existing shortages to demand new sacrifices. The administration says America cannot afford its debt, and therefore we cannot afford health care for the poor. The administration says America doesn’t have a healthy economy, and therefore we have to accept economic “hardship.” The administration says America doesn’t have enough manufacturing, and so we must suffer the consequences of less trade. The administration says America doesn’t have enough housing, and so we need fewer immigrants. The administration says American scientists aren’t focused on the right research, and so we have to gut our federal science programs. Again and again, Americans are being fed the line that everything that we don’t have requires the elimination of something that we need.\n\nThis essay has been excerpted from Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein’s new book, Abundance\n\nThe MAGA movement might try to justify its wrecking-ball style by arguing that its extreme approach is commensurate with the level of anger that voters feel about the status quo. But just because Trump is a product of American rage does not mean he is a solution to it.\n\nIn housing, for example, Americans have every right to be furious. Home construction has lagged behind our national needs for decades. Today, the median age of first-time homebuyers has surged to a record high of 38. Large declines in young homeownership have likely prevented many young people from dating, marrying, and starting a family. Although Trump was swept into office on a wave of economic frustration, his initial foray into economic policy has done little to help the situation. As the National Association of Home Builders pointed out in an alarmed March 7 memo, his persistent threat of tariffs on Mexico and Canada could drive up the cost of crucial materials, such as softwood lumber and drywall gypsum, which are “largely sourced from Canada and Mexico, respectively.” Meanwhile, Trump’s anti-immigrant policies foretell new labor shortages in the construction industry, where roughly 25 percent or more workers are foreign-born.\n\nThis is where Democrats should be able to stand up and show that they have a winning response to the less-is-less politics from the right. But in many places run by Democrats, the solution on offer is another variety of scarcity. Blue cities are laden with rules and litigation procedures that block new housing and transit construction. As my colleague Yoni Appelbaum has noted, in California cities where the share of progressives votes goes up by 10 points, the number of housing permits issued declines by 30 percent. Where the supply of homes is constricted, housing prices soar, and homelessness rises. As of 2023, the five states with the highest rates of homelessness were New York, Hawaii, California, Oregon, and Washington—all run by Democrats.\n\nFrom the March 2025 issue: How progressives froze the American dream\n\nAs the cost of living rises in blue states, tens of thousands of families are leaving them. But the left isn’t just losing people. It’s losing an argument. It has become a coalition of Kindness Is Everything signs in front yards zoned for single-family homes. Liberals say they want to save the planet from climate change, but in practice, many liberal areas have shut down zero-carbon nuclear plants and protested solar-power projects, leaving it to red states such as Texas to lead the nation in renewable-energy generation. Democrats cannot afford to become the party of language over outcomes, of ever more lawn signs and ever fewer working-class families.\n\nIf Trump’s opponents are going to win at the polls, they will need to construct a new political movement, one that aims for abundance instead of scarcity. Such a movement would combine the progressive virtue of care for the working class and a traditionally conservative celebration of national greatness, while taking a page from the libertarian obsession with eliminating harmful regulations to make the most important markets work better. It would braid a negative critique of Trump’s attack on the government with a positive vision of actual good governance in America—while providing a rigorous focus on removing the bottlenecks that stand in the way.\n\nAbundance begins with specific goals for America’s future. Imagine much more housing where it’s most in demand. An economy powered by plentiful clean energy. A revitalized national science policy prioritizing high-risk discoveries that extend lives and improve health. And a national invention agenda that seeks to pull forward technologies in transportation, medicine, energy, and beyond that would improve people’s lives.\n\nSometimes what stands in the way of abundance are special interests, powerful incumbents, and conservatives. Oil and gas companies have at times thwarted the rise of renewable energy. The MAGA faithful seem to care much more about protecting their own than the rule of law and redirecting income into their own pockets rather than redistributing it to the poor.\n\nBut if Democrats want to understand why they’re failing to achieve their goals in the places they control, they need to concede that the faulty party also lives in the mirror. Look at California. Its most populous cities are run by Democrats. Every statewide elected official in California is a Democrat. Liberals should be able to say: “Vote for Democrats, and we’ll turn America into California!” Instead, with the state’s infamously high cost of living and stark homelessness crisis, it is conservatives who can say: “Vote for Democrats, and they’ll turn America into California.” Liberal governance should be an advertisement for itself, not for its opposition.\n\nSaying for sure what has gone wrong is difficult, because so much has clearly gone wrong. But undoubtedly the character of liberalism has changed in the past few decades. New Deal liberalism believed in building. After the industrial explosion of World War II, the war machine was transformed into a peacetime growth machine. The construction of houses, energy, roads, bridges, and infrastructure boomed. Then came the backlash; the growth machine became an anti-growth machine. Environmental laws arose in the 1960s and ’70s that both helped counteract the real problem of pollution and created new problems for anybody who wanted to alter the physical world. New legal norms and court decisions made it easier and more common for citizens to sue to block the state. As the historian Paul Sabin argued in his book Public Citizens, the result was a liberalism that regarded government not as a partner in the solution of societal problems but rather as the source of those very problems. \"It was as if liberals took a bicycle apart to fix it but never quite figured out how to get it running properly again,\" Sabin wrote.\n\nI can imagine somebody opposed to the MAGA movement reading all of this and thinking: Why, at a time when Trump presents such a clear threat to the American project, is it appropriate to focus such criticism on the Democratic side?\n\nFirst, to make the argument for a liberal alternative to Trumpism, Democrats have to show Americans that voting for liberals actually works. Often, to be sure, it works beautifully. The cliché of the “tax-and-spend liberal” belies the good that taxing and spending can do. Social programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, public education, and housing vouchers are essential parts of a modern state, and they require, yes, taxes on the wealthy. But people on the left are sometimes so fixated on spending money that they lose sight of what that spending does in the world. In 2008, California approved $33 billion for a high-speed rail system that has lingered in construction purgatory for more than a decade. San Francisco’s procedural kludge somehow drove up the cost of a public toilet to $1.7 million. New York City’s archaic laws have combined with modern complacency to make the Long Island Rail Road home to the world’s most expensive mile of underground track. Chicago’s mayor recently bragged that his city “invested $11 billion in contracting to build 10,000 more units to offer affordable housing”—that is, $1.1 million per affordable unit. The Biden White House passed “the biggest infrastructure bill in generations ” —but states found using the money so onerous that billions of dollars in broadband expansion were simply never spent. If Democrats want to represent the coalition that believes in government, they have to guarantee that government can actually build what it intends to.\n\nSecond, Americans are furious about the status quo—the youngest voters are “more jaded than ever about the state of American leadership,” according to the Harvard Political Review—and liberals need a new style of politics for the age of anti-establishment anger. The right’s answer to rage is chaos in search of an agenda. MAGA acts like a drunk toddler with a chain saw, carelessly slashing through state programs with a high risk of self-harm. But Democrats should not allow the forces of negative polarization to turn them into the party that reflexively defends the status quo at every turn, even when it means refusing to reform institutions that have lost the public’s trust. Quite the opposite: Abundance should be a movement of proud, active, and even obsessive institutional renewal.\n\nConsider U.S. science policy, an area that is under attack from the right at this moment. As the centerpiece of U.S. biomedical funding, the National Institutes of Health has accomplished extraordinary things; you will have a hard time finding many scientific breakthroughs in the past 50 years—in heart disease, genetics, epidemiology—that were not irrigated by its funding.\n\nRead: Inside the collapse at the NIH\n\nBut many of the same factors that have infamously plagued our housing and energy markets—paperwork, bureaucratic drift, entrenched incumbent interests—have become fixtures in American science. It is practically a cliché among researchers that the NIH privileges incremental science over the sort of high-risk, high-reward investigations that would likely uncover the most important new truths. Surveys indicate that the typical U.S. researcher spends up to 40 percent of their time preparing grant proposals and filling out paperwork rather than actually conducting science. As John Doench, the director of research and development in functional genomics at the Broad Institute, told me: “Folks need to understand how broken the system is.”\n\nAs the nation’s preeminent scientific institution, the NIH should take a page from science itself and run more experiments to find new ways to encourage researchers to pursue their most promising inquiries. To reduce the paperwork burden, it could run pilots that eliminate major parts of the application process. For some applications, it could replace the existing selection process with a lottery. And then, over years and decades, it would collect data and study the results, and determine if in fact there is a better way to fund science and cure disease.\n\nIt is a travesty that the Trump administration has brought biomedical research to the brink of crisis by attempting to freeze grants, fire workers, slash overall funding, and bully universities. But in an age of institutional anger—when, as NBC pollsters recently put it, “we have never before seen this level of sustained pessimism”—liberals cannot allow themselves to be painted as America’s true conservatives, the party that readily and blindly defends a flawed status quo.\n\nThe news is full of political strife. But the University of Cambridge historian Gary Gerstle believes that the parties’ subtle agreements about the direction of economic and foreign policy are what really shape American history. He coined the term political order to refer to the “constellation of ideologies, policies, and constituencies that shape American politics in ways that endure beyond the two-, four-, and six-year election cycles.”\n\nTwo political orders have defined the past 100 years. Each was forged by an internal crisis and external threat. From the 1930s until the 1960s, the New Deal reigned over American life. It enlarged the government in response to the Great Depression and provided an American reply to the global specter of communism. In the 1970s and ’80s, stagflation converged with the gradual decline of the Soviet Union to make way for the rise of a second era: neoliberalism. For decades, conservatives fought to make government smaller, while progressives such as Ralph Nader found ways to make government weaker by submerging the state in lawsuits. If the New Deal birthed the age of bureaucracy, neoliberalism produced an age of vetocracy. Now we are living with the consequences of both. We have a government that is, oddly, both big and weak.\n\nToday, we seem to be in a rare period in American history, when the decline of one political order makes space for another. This crackup was decades in the making. It started with the Great Recession, which shattered a broad belief in free and unregulated markets. It continued throughout the 2010s, as slow economic recovery fueled public resentment of inequality, and an affordability crisis gathered steam. In 2020, the pandemic obliterated many Americans’ trust in government, or what was left of it. And from 2021 to 2024, inflation brought national attention to the interlocking crises of scarcity, supply, and unaffordability. For years, the boundaries of American politics had felt fixed, even settled. But now they are falling.\n\n“For a political order to triumph, it must have a narrative, a story it tells about the good life,” Gerstle told me. Today’s politics are suffused with pessimism about government because “a way of living sold to us as good and achievable is no longer good, or no longer achievable.” In 2016, the rise of Bernie Sanders on the left and Donald Trump on the right revealed how many Americans had stopped believing that the life they had been promised was achievable. What both the socialist left and the populist-authoritarian right understood was that the story that had been told by the establishments of both parties, the story that had kept their movements consigned to the margins, had come to its end.\n\nPolitical movements succeed when they build a vision of the future that is imbued with the virtues of the past. Franklin D. Roosevelt pitched his expansive view of government as a sentinel for American freedoms: of speech, of worship, from want, from fear. Decades later, Ronald Reagan recast government as freedom’s nemesis rather than its protector. Abundance, too, is about redefining freedom for our own time. It is about the freedom to build in an age of blocking; the freedom to move and live where you want in an age of a stuck working class; the freedom from curable diseases that come from scientific breakthroughs. Trump has defined his second term by demolition and deprivation. America can instead choose abundance.\n\nThis essay has been excerpted from Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s new book, Abundance.\n\nAbundance By Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson",

        "content": "The Republicans swept the elections because of inflation and public disorder.\n\nThe year was 1946. The end of wartime price controls had sent prices soaring. Railways, coal mines, and steel mills were shut by strikes. The Republican message was clear and convincing: “Had enough?”\n\nYes, said the voters, they had. Democrats lost 55 seats in the House, 12 in the Senate. The Republicans took control of both chambers of Congress, after spending the preceding decade and a half as the minority party in both.\n\nAll seemed set for a huge GOP win in the 1948 presidential election. A leading candidate for the nomination that year was Robert Alphonso Taft, the eldest son of former President William Howard Taft. Robert Taft represented Ohio in the U.S. Senate, where he’d accumulated a staunchly conservative voting record. He opposed foreign aid, distrusted foreign-military alliances, and championed a high protective tariff for American industries.\n\nRead: President Taft, the anti-Trump\n\nIn September 1947, Taft toured California. National and local reporters closely followed the probable next president. Some 50 journalists gathered when Taft called a press conference in an auditorium in Santa Cruz. Taft was asked about the cost of living because prices were rising fast, even faster than in the previous year, when voter discontent had already been burning hot.\n\nSeldom has a single answer to a reporter’s question sunk a political career so rapidly and totally. Here’s how Time magazine reported what came next:\n\nBob Taft was talking matter-of-factly, almost abstractedly, as if he were speaking across a committee table. But for a fraction of a second, every man in the room looked up and stared as if the Senator had just pulled out his penknife, opened it, and absently swallowed it. Taft had been discussing the high price of food and what he thought should be done to allay it. “Voluntary reduction of consumption,” he said, “is the first step. We should eat less … eat less meat and eat less extravagantly.” He went right on talking. The Chicago Daily News’s Ed Lahey broke in, gave him a chance to get off the hook by asking: “Do you think that would cover the whole populace?” “Yes,” the Senator said. “Hoover suggested the same thing some time ago. He suggested that we ought to start … a campaign to save food and eat less.”\n\nAt Taft’s next appearances, hecklers chanted “Eat less, eat less.” Democrats ridiculed him as “Eat Less Taft.” The following year, Republicans rejected Taft as their nominee in favor of the more progressive and internationalist Thomas Dewey, the governor of New York. The GOP had lost its momentum: At the general election, the Democrats held the presidency and regained control of the House and Senate.\n\nI think of “Eat Less Taft” as I hear President Donald Trump’s appointees defend their administration’s consumer-crushing tariffs. On Meet the Press this past Sunday, the near-billionaire Treasury secretary proclaimed that “the American dream is not ‘Let them eat flat-screens’” and “the American dream is not contingent on cheap baubles from China.”\n\nScott Bessent’s denigration of affordable televisions was not a one-off gaffe. In a speech to the Economic Club of New York on March 6, he stuck to the script: “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream.” A few days later, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was asked on television whether the Trump tariffs were worth the risk of recession. Lutnick delivered an emphatic yes: “These policies are the most important thing America has ever had. It’s worth it.” President Trump alluded to an impending “disturbance” in his March 4 speech to a Joint Session of Congress. Questioned later in the Oval Office about a possible recession, he euphemistically acknowledged a “period of transition” ahead.\n\nDavid Frum: The price America will pay for Trump’s tariffs\n\nSo get ready to Eat Less.\n\nAt least Taft’s message offered some kind of hope at the end—and, of course, it wasn’t Taft’s personal fault that food prices had risen. But Trump’s tariffs are Trump’s fault, and it’s clear that if he has his way, they will be permanent.\n\nTrump promotes tariffs as a way to shift the costs of financing the U.S. government from Americans to foreigners. His commerce secretary suggests that tariffs might do away with the need for income taxes altogether. Income taxes fall most heavily on the affluent; tariffs fall most heavily on the middle class and poor. Trump has sold his party on tariffs as a way to redistribute the cost of government away from his donors to his voters.\n\nAt the same time, Trump’s tariffs are advertised to do a dozen other magical things. They promise to stop Chinese currency manipulation, as well as to stop fentanyl from coming into the United States. They are supposed to compel foreign governments to do more of the government regulation that the United States wants (for example, to police intellectual-property theft) and less of the government regulation that the U.S. does not want. Even with this wish list, the tariffs make no sense. If cheap Chinese goods are your issue, why tax Canadian aluminum and Mexican glass? If your goal is to encourage other countries to increase their defense spending, why start a trade war with Australia after it already made a down payment on three U.S.-made nuclear-powered submarines?\n\nTrump is a flimflam man who will promise anything to anybody and count on the suckers forgetting tomorrow what he said yesterday. His Cabinet officers, however, are gradually revealing the true cost of the Eat Less scam. They do not match Taft’s self-harming candor. But their real message of “Less for you, more for us” is reverberating louder and clearer.",

        "content": "For decades, this was the widely accepted way to feed a baby: Sit them in a high chair, pop open a jar of mushy pureed peas, scoop some onto a tiny spoon, make an “open wide” face, and—whoosh—make it fly like an airplane into the baby’s mouth.\n\nNo longer. Over the past 10 years or so, a method called “baby-led weaning” has caught on among many parents. Its proponents claim that infants don’t need to be spoon-fed baby food. In fact, they don’t need to be spoon-fed anything. Parents should give them big hunks of real food to paw at and chomp on as soon as they’re ready to start solids, even if they have only one or two teeth. Just throw an entire broccoli crown or chicken drumstick at your six-month-old and see what they do with it. (The process is called “weaning” because as the baby eats more solids, they’re supposed to drink progressively less breast milk or formula.) By following this method, you can supposedly reduce the risk that your child will grow up to be a fussy eater or an obese adult.\n\nI was drawn to baby-led weaning in part because, as a sometime health reporter, I was concerned about childhood obesity. Baby-led weaning also seemed somehow more natural and pure. It didn’t involve Big Baby Food. And it was a way of trusting my baby to know what he needs because he is smart and advanced.\n\nStill, as I prepared my then-six-month-old son’s first plate of solid food, I didn’t want to start with a T-bone. I decided to test the waters with something pretty soft. Following a recipe from a popular app called Solid Starts, I stirred a little ground turkey into some sweet potato and put it on my son’s tray. Tentatively, he put the clump in his mouth. Within seconds, he gagged so hard that he threw up all over himself. Mealtime ended with him crying and getting hosed off.\n\nOlga Khazan: Doomed to be a tradwife\n\nThis process repeated itself with every food we tried, until a few months in, when he “progressed” to taking bites of food and then promptly spitting them out. We watched with alarm as our son turned 10 months, and then 11, mere weeks from the age—12 months—when he was supposed to stop drinking formula and start getting nearly all of his nutrition from food. Except he was consuming, generously, 50 calories of food a day.\n\nMy husband and I didn’t know what to do. The internet is so awash in posts and videos about baby-led weaning that I wasn’t sure how to adapt when the method didn’t work. Our pediatrician had not previously been helpful in matters of feeding, so we didn’t ask her. Instead, I reached out to baby-feeding experts, who said that if baby-led weaning fails, spoon-feeding your baby mashed-up or pureed food is fine. I also came away from these interviews with the impression that baby-led weaning has less evidence behind it than its supporters claim—and that like many newfangled, internet-supercharged baby trends, it has the effect of encouraging parents to make raising children way too hard for themselves.\n\nBaby-led weaning was pioneered more than two decades ago by Gill Rapley, a British public-health nurse. As she visited families who were introducing solid foods to their babies, she noticed that some babies resisted being spoon-fed. The parents thought the babies didn’t like the food they were offering, but Rapley suspected they didn’t enjoy the process. She would suggest that those parents give their babies large pieces of food to hold instead. “And they would do that,” she told me in an interview, “and it would solve the problem.”\n\nIn her 2008 book on baby-led weaning, which has sold more than 100,000 copies—a sizable number for a book of this type—Rapley writes that as babies need more nutrients, they will eat more purposefully, as though the baby “instinctively knows that he actually needs this food.” She asserts that the method promotes greater “satiety awareness,” which means a baby-led baby “may be less likely to overeat when they are older.” She writes that the method carries no greater risk of choking than spoon-feeding because the baby is in control of what’s in his mouth, and recommends treating the baby almost like an honored dinner guest, suggesting that you should even avoid wiping a baby’s face between mouthfuls.\n\nBaby-led weaning really came into vogue after the 2019 launch of the Brooklyn-based Solid Starts, which features recipes and tips for serving whole foods to infants of different ages. Though parents can simply buy Rapley’s book, many parents seem to learn the technique through the influencers, programs, and apps they find online. Half a dozen pediatricians and infant-feeding experts I spoke with said many patients ask them about the practice, usually after seeing it on social media. Solid Starts has 3.7 million followers on Instagram (more than the 3.6 million babies born in the U.S. in 2022) and millions of downloads. One speech therapist who frequently posts baby-led-weaning tips on TikTok has nearly a quarter-million followers. An assortment of baby-led-weaning Facebook groups each has tens of thousands of members who post pictures of their infants slamming down plates of sausage and pasta. Many of the instructions for how to deploy the method come at a price. One program costs $247, another is $59, and Solid Starts is $20 a month. One specialist offers four months of pediatric “nutrition coaching” for $999.\n\nCarla Cevasco: What parents did before formula\n\nThe tone of pro-baby-led-weaning posts is enthusiastic verging on evangelistic: The speech therapist argues in a video that it’s spoon-feeding, not baby-led weaning, that increases the risk of choking. Moms post time-lapse videos of themselves crinkle-cutting carrots, then steaming them, then burning their fingers as they put them through the “squish” test (if it’s squishable, it’s safe to feed a baby). They post videos of their nine-month-olds eagerly chomping on pork chops, or of slightly older babies eating daintily with a fork. “If you want this,” the text reads, “you have to go through this”—a clip of the same baby messily shoveling yogurt into his mouth.\n\nAll of this content has the effect of making baby-led weaning seem like the only thing you should do. “There’s all these things on the internet, and it’s like, you must be a bad parent if you don’t do baby-led,” Mark Corkins, the chair of the nutrition committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told me.\n\nAs our own baby-led failures started to pile up, I did feel like a bad parent. But as I looked at the science behind this practice more closely, I started to wonder if I was truly failing, or if baby-led weaning is just not all it’s cracked up to be.\n\nBaby-led weaning is billed as “easy” because you’re supposed to be able to offer the baby whatever you’re eating. Some parents do find this approach appealing: One representative comment on Solid Starts’ Instagram page reads, “Feeding our baby the same meals as we eat … is the best thing ever. Introduces her to so many foods and also saves us time and money!”\n\nI do not share this enthusiasm, though, because babies can’t eat many of the things adults do. According to most experts, babies under a year old can’t have sugar, honey, unpasteurized or raw cheese, raw seafood, processed or ready-made meals, or additional salt. Rapley also recommends that you avoid artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, sweeteners, and soy milk. Good luck finding a food in America that doesn’t contain at least one of those things. At one point in her book, Rapley, echoing other baby-feeding experts, suggests that babies avoid certain kinds of tuna, but then recommends that at a restaurant, you share with the baby your meal of a “baked potato with tuna” (coming to a Chili’s menu near you!).\n\nAt home, I’m almost never eating something that’s suitable for a baby. Most days for dinner, I have a big salad with thick, crunchy kale; nuts of some kind; and an unpasteurized cheese—none of which is okay for babies. (“Salads are not great for young children,” Rapley acknowledged.) I often serve the salad alongside a salty, spicy pasta dish, but babies aren’t supposed to have salt. Rapley told me you can just add salt later, to your own plate—which would mean that you’re boiling pasta in unsalted water and searing an unsalted chicken breast for you to eat, and for your little one to gnaw on.\n\nPlus, what you’re getting in exchange for this flavor-free lifestyle is not totally clear. The biggest purported benefit of baby-led weaning is that allowing babies to “tune into their bodies,” as Rapley puts it, may help prevent obesity later in life. But this has turned out to not be quite right: Many studies on this question find no difference in weight between babies who are baby-led-weaned versus spoon-fed.\n\nRapley also claims that children who are baby-led, rather than spoon-fed, become less finicky eaters. Some experts I spoke with agreed with this assessment, but one small study found that baby-led weaning made no difference in picky eating. One childhood-obesity researcher, Rachael Taylor of the University of Otago, in New Zealand, told me that a main benefit of baby-led weaning seems to be that it makes parents feel good: “When you talk to parents who like it,” she said, “they love it.”\n\nThat’s if their babies will do it. Another claim of baby-led-weaning proponents is that whether the baby eats much of anything doesn’t matter; just licking or gumming the food and spitting it out is okay. When I asked Rapley what to do if your baby still isn’t eating enough solid food by the time they turn 1, she suggested that allowing the baby to continue to drink formula might be fine.\n\nBut infant-feeding experts told me not to do this; they said that babies should be eating lots of actual food by 12 months. If they’re not, Corkins said, “you should have bailed on baby-led a lot sooner.” Another feeding researcher, Charlotte Wright at the University of Glasgow, suggested that families who practice baby-led weaning should combine finger foods with spoon-feeding to ensure that their babies are eating enough.\n\nMark Fishbein, who runs a pediatric feeding clinic at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, told me he wouldn’t recommend baby-led weaning to most families. “There may be some benefit, maybe,” he said, “but the risks are much higher.” Infants doing baby-led weaning gag frequently, which, according to Fishbein, occasionally triggers a feeding aversion that can cause the baby to shun all foods, from a spoon or otherwise. (Rapley acknowledged that excessive gagging “can indeed be a bad thing,” but said that it generally correlates with an underlying problem that baby-led weaning exposes, rather than causes.) When I mentioned a common baby-led food suggestion, a whole piece of meat, to Dina DiMaggio, a pediatrics professor at NYU, she said, “I get worried about things like that”—because big, tough pieces of food can pose a choking risk.\n\nRead: This is no way to talk about children\n\nStill, most experts I spoke with said that baby-led weaning can be a reasonable thing for normally developing babies to try, but that parents of kids with delays or medical issues should proceed with caution. (Rapley has released a companion book geared toward parents of kids with disabilities, claiming that baby-led weaning can work for them, too—though with a “transitional phase” that involves purees or mashed foods.)\n\nThe upshot seems to be that baby-led weaning is fine if it works for your kid, but that the “traditional” way—spoon-feeding your baby—is also fine. That’s not the impression many parents get, though. “My patients, their parents are very concerned,” DiMaggio told me. They’re just doing baby-led weaning “because some influencer said to do it.” In this way, the evangelizing for baby-led weaning has come to resemble some of the proselytizing for breastfeeding and unmedicated childbirth and so many other things that are supposedly free and easy and best for your baby, but can be anything but for the parents.\n\nRead: The fairy-tale promises of Montessori parenting\n\nGranted, mine is the only baby I’ve ever interacted with at length, but I’ve come to the conclusion that he should not be leading his own weaning. He should not, frankly, be leading anything, because he is—and I say this with all the love in my heart—not that smart. He thinks the trash can is awesome. He doesn’t realize that I don’t die when I go to the bathroom. He believes the Roomba is sentient. He does not, unfortunately, instinctively understand how to eat a diet rich in varied macronutrients, in order to perfectly complement his formula feeds in an age-appropriate way. That’s my job, and I’m going to lead him through it.",

Phillips has found herself in a strange position as of late: trying to convince her students that romantic love is worthwhile. They don’t believe in overly idealizing partnerships or in the clichés fed to them in rom-coms; some have declared that love is a concept created by the media. Phillips, a journalist who teaches a SUNY New Paltz course called “Love and Heartbreak,” responds that of course relationships aren’t all perfect passion, and we should question the tropes we’re surrounded by. But also: Those tropes began somewhere. Across cultures, people describe the experience of falling for someone in quite similar ways, “whether they grew up with a Disney-movie IV in their vein,” she told me, or “in a remote area with no media whatsoever.” The sensation is big, she tells her students; it’s overwhelming; it can feel utterly transcendent. They’re skeptical.\n\nMaybe if Phillips had been teaching this class a decade ago, her students would already have learned some of this firsthand. Today, though, that’s less likely: Research indicates that the number of teens experiencing romantic relationships has dropped. In a 2023 poll from the Survey Center on American Life, 56 percent of Gen Z adults said they’d been in a romantic relationship at any point in their teen years, compared with 76 percent of Gen Xers and 78 percent of Baby Boomers. And the General Social Survey, a long-running poll of about 3,000 Americans, found in 2021 that 54 percent of participants ages 18 to 34 reported not having a “steady” partner; in 2004, only 33 percent said the same.\n\nAs I’ve written, a whole lot of American adults are withdrawing from romance—not just young people. But the trend seems to be especially pronounced for Gen Z, or people born roughly between 1997 and 2012. Of course, you can grow into a perfectly mature and healthy adult without ever having had a romantic relationship; some research even suggests you might be better off that way. In the aggregate, though, this shift could be concerning: a sign, researchers told me, of a generation struggling with vulnerability. A first love, for so many, has been a milestone on the path to adulthood—a challenging, thrilling, world-expanding experience that can help people understand who they are and whom they’re looking for. What’s lost if that rite of passage disappears?\n\nYou can experience so much without being in a defined relationship. You can flirt; you can kiss; you can dance. You can have a crush so big it takes up all the space in your brain; you can care about someone deeply; you can get hurt—badly. Plenty of young people, then, could be having transformative romantic encounters and still reporting that they’ve never been in a relationship. It could be the label, not the emotional reality, that’s changing, Thao Ha, a developmental psychologist at Arizona State University, told me. She’s found that lots of high schoolers report having “dated” before—a looser term that might better suit the realities of adolescent courtship today. (In a YouGov poll from last year, about 50 percent of respondents aged 18 to 34 said they’d been in a “situationship,” or undefined relationship.) Some of that activity might not entail exclusivity or regularity, or any promise of long-term commitment. But it could still help young people with what researchers told me are some core rewards of early romantic exploration: gaining autonomy from parents, developing a sense of identity, what Phillips called an “existential” benefit—the “sometimes painful, sometimes amazing trial-and-error process of seeking closeness.”\n\nBecoming a well-rounded grown-up, in fact, doesn’t really require romantic experience of any sort. Adolescence and emerging adulthood are times of uncertainty; what young people need most, Amy Rauer, a human-development professor at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, told me, is often just a cheerleader: a peer, a grandparent, a coach, or someone else making them feel valued, which can set them up to feel secure in future relationships. Teens can also learn social skills—how to make small talk, resolve arguments, empathize across differences—in all kinds of platonic relationships.\n\nRead: The slow, quiet demise of America romance\n\nSome research, Phillips pointed out, actually suggests that young people might benefit from a lack of romantic activity. One study found that, compared with their dating peers, students who dated very infrequently or not at all over a seven-year period were seen by their teachers as having better leadership and social skills, and reported fewer symptoms of depression. After all, young love isn’t always positive. It can be an emotional whirlwind; it can distract from schoolwork, or from friends, or from other interests. In the worst cases, it can be abusive. (Adolescent girls experience intimate-partner violence at particularly high rates.) And when it ends, teens—with little perspective and few learned coping mechanisms—can be absolutely wrecked.\n\nDespite how common a lack of relationship experience is now—especially but not only for teens—a lot of people still feel embarrassed by it. TikTok is filled with influencers declaring that they’re 26 or 30 or 40 and have never been in a relationship, sharing how insecure that’s made them feel; commenters stream in, by the hundreds of thousands, to divulge their own feelings of shame. Many of my friends, who are entering their 30s, constantly stress about this: They fear they won’t know how to be a good partner if the opportunity arises. But all of a person’s interactions, not just romantic ones, can shape how they’ll show up in a relationship. One 2019 study, which followed 165 subjects ages 13 to 30, found that strong friendships in adolescence predicted romantic-life satisfaction in adulthood; early romantic experience, meanwhile, wasn’t related to future satisfaction at all. (Teens commonly learn how to fight and make up with friends, Phillips told me, but they might be less likely to stick it out with a lover long enough for conflict resolution.)\n\nRead: The dating-app diversity paradox\n\nOverall, when it comes to who you are in a relationship, what matters most is simply who you are, period. And the traits that make you you are likely to remain fairly stable throughout your life. A 2022 study found, for instance, that subjects who were single during adolescence—but had their first relationship by age 26—reported no lower self-esteem than those who’d started dating earlier. Tita Gonzalez Avilés, a personality psychologist at Germany’s Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz who has led some of this research, told me that although people often think their relationships will change them, the influence typically happens the other way around: Who you are shapes what kind of relationship you’ll have. Research has even shown that people’s satisfaction in a relationship tends to remain pretty consistent across their various partners.\n\nGiven all that, you might think it a good thing that Gen Z has less going on in the romance department. Perhaps young people are busy with other pursuits, focusing on friendship and school and hobbies; maybe they no longer want to settle for a mediocre partner. The transition to adulthood tends to take longer today, pushing back lots of different milestones—steps such as financial independence, buying a home, and, notably, getting married—sometimes indefinitely. In that sense, young people have an eminently rational reason to hold off on seeking partnership: The deadline is extended. But researchers have pointed to other, more worrisome reasons for the romance dip.\n\nPhillips has heard a lot about situationships—and scenarios that aren’t even well-defined enough to use that label. For her new book, First Love: Guiding Teens Through Relationships and Heartbreak, she interviewed more than 100 young people and parents, and found, as Ha did, that early romance today tends to reside in a gray area. “You have a long period of we’re talking,” Phillips told me. “You’re kind of dancing around the idea of a sexual-romantic connection, maybe even having some of those experiences, but not really talking about what it is.” For some, the lack of strict relationship expectations can be freeing. But many, Phillips told me, find the ambiguity distressing, because they don’t know what they have the right to feel—or the right to ask for. Some recounted how they ended up feeling invested in a fling—and described it not only as bad news, but as a personal failure: They said that they “got caught” (as if red-handed), “caught feelings” (like an illness), or succumbed to “dumb-bitch hour” (when late at night, defenses down, they texted a crush and—God forbid—let themselves feel close to someone). “Young people would be hard on themselves,” Phillips told me, “because they would think, Okay, this person let me know this wasn’t going to be a thing. And then my heart let it be a thing.”\n\nThe young-love recession, in other words, might reflect a real shift in how comfortable Americans are, on the whole, with emotional intimacy. Generational researchers have described Gen Z as a cohort particularly concerned with security, averse to risk, and slow to trust—so it makes sense that a lot of teens today might be hesitant to throw themselves into a relationship, or even just to admit they care whether their dalliance will continue next week. In a 2023 Hinge survey of Gen Z daters, 90 percent of participants said they wanted to find love—but 56 percent said that fear of rejection had kept them from pursuing a potential relationship, and 57 percent said they’d refrained from confessing their feelings about someone because they worried it would “be a turn-off.” Those reservations can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, Phillips said, in which young people keep a romantic prospect at arm’s length—and then, when they feel confused or get hurt anyway, they become even more wary of relationships. “Why would I want to go any further in this world,” she said many wonder, “when I had this flirtation that seemed to be very close and very promising and went nowhere?”\n\nRead: The people who quit dating\n\nI heard something similar from Daniel A. Cox, the director of the Survey Center on American Life: People still badly want connection, but among Gen Z, “there’s a real sense of anxiety about how to go about it.” That social nervousness affects platonic and romantic relationships alike; he’s found, in fact, that people who spend more time with friends are also more likely to have dated regularly during their teen years. “Trying to forge romantic connections and be vulnerable—it’s really difficult,” he said, “when you’re constantly worried about being hurt or being taken advantage of.”\n\nSome of that self-protective instinct has probably trickled down from older generations, especially when it comes to dynamics in heterosexual relationships. As Cox has found while reporting a forthcoming book on the gender divide, men and women seem to be growing ever further apart. Young men are shifting rightward, and many are feeling misunderstood. Women, meanwhile, have become more suspicious of men. Fear of sexual assault has increased significantly in recent years, and so has concern about dating-app safety. If so many grown women are feeling vigilant, imagine how girls and younger women feel: at a vulnerable age, still learning about the world and already surrounded by the message—and, in plenty of cases, the reality—that boys and men are dangerous. Imagine, too, how some boys and young men feel: just figuring out who they are and already getting the message that they’re not trusted. Perhaps it’s not surprising that people are trying to control their romantic feelings, whether by focusing on friendships or by keeping situationships allegedly emotion-free.\n\nEven under conditions of a gender cold war, many girls might get on fine—but boys could suffer more. When psychologists told me that young people can flourish in the absence of romance, that was assuming they have close friends to rely on and to teach them social graces (including one as simple as making conversation). Boys and young men, who aren’t as likely to have such tight bonds, tend to learn those skills from women. Maybe they have a sister or a mother or female friends who can help with that—but if not, Cox told me, being single might put them at a real emotional and developmental disadvantage. That might make them less prepared to date.\n\nRead: The golden age of dating doesn’t exist\n\nA rise in skepticism toward romance is a loss, not just for boys but for society as a whole. Romantic love isn’t better or more important than platonic love, but it’s different—and telling yourself you have no need for it doesn’t necessarily make it true.\n\nPhillips talked to her students about an excerpt of Plato’s Symposium, in which—at the beginning of time—Zeus splits each human in two in order to foil their plan to overthrow the gods. From then on, everyone wanders around yearning for their other half. Falling in love, according to the story, is when you finally find it. Alas: Her students hated the story. They didn’t like the idea of only one other person being meant for each of us, or the suggestion that they’d be incomplete without such a reunion. They told her they wanted to be whole all by themselves—not dependent on a soulmate. They had a point.\n\nAnd yet, Phillips still felt there was something sad about their reaction. They didn’t seem to understand that “relationships are an interpersonal exchange,” she said: that “they involve both feeling expanded by someone else and then some genuine sacrifices.” You are at least a little dependent on someone in a relationship; that’s what the symbiosis of love requires. It’s scary—but it can be interesting, and beautiful when it’s good, and sometimes formative even when it doesn’t stay good. You might want to find out for yourself.",

Priscilla is 14 when she meets an already famous 24-year-old Elvis. While still a teenager, she moves with her future husband to Graceland, where she wears sophisticated clothes and sits in plush rooms. As the film critic Anthony Lane wrote in a New Yorker review, to call the movie superficial, “even more so than Coppola’s other films, is no derogation, because surfaces are her subject.”\n\nPriscilla is a revisionist project: It aims to tell the other side of Elvis’s story, to convey another perspective on a beloved cultural figure whose life has been the subject of countless books and biopics. So I wasn’t surprised that I left the theater unsettled, with a darker view of this artist whose songs I’d sung in elementary-school revues and whose home I’d visited on a high-school-band trip. But beyond the straightforward record-correcting objective of the movie (which is inspired by Priscilla Presley’s 1985 memoir, Elvis and Me), Coppola’s choice to end the film on a stark, ambiguous note reminded me that an abrupt conclusion can be as satisfying as a tidy one. That, in a movie concerned with the way things seem, feels true to life.\n\n— Lora Kelley, associate editor\n\n***\n\nThe Death of Stalin (streaming on Pluto TV)\n\nTotalitarianism, when it’s not terrifying, can be absurd—the constant bowing to a Dear Leader, the seemingly arbitrary list of enemies and outlawed ideas that change every hour, the silly pomp of statues and parading armies. It’s almost impossible to capture the humor without undermining the horror. But The Death of Stalin, Armando Iannucci’s 2017 satire, brilliantly reveals the ridiculous side of authoritarian rule, and it opened my eyes to the small, shuffling, utterly banal individuals who undergird even the scariest systems.\n\nIannucci makes little effort at historical accuracy—I mean, Steve Buscemi plays Nikita Khrushchev—but he gets at deeper truths. The story takes place following the sudden death of the titular dictator. The power vacuum that opens is filled with scheming and backstabbing politicians, including Khrushchev, Lavrentiy Beria, and Georgy Malenkov. But Iannucci mines it all for laughs, and they are plentiful. The pettiness, the servility, the insecurity of these men are all on display as they spin around Stalin’s corpse. And watching this transfer of power reduced to a bizarre human drama reminds you about what makes tyranny possible: very ordinary people.\n\n— Gal Beckerman, staff writer\n\n***\n\nRivers and Tides (streaming on Tubi)\n\nWhen a friend first showed me Rivers and Tides, I had never heard of Andy Goldsworthy, and I had surely never seen anyone do what he did. The documentary follows the British artist through fields, forests, and tidelands as he creates sculptures and ephemeral works from materials he finds, often challenging our assumptions of what those materials, and their environments, even are. One frigid morning, we observe Goldsworthy snapping icicles apart, and whittling them with his teeth, to reconstruct them into a fluid form that seems to cut back and forth through a boulder; when the rising sun finally hits the sculpture, it’s spectacular. Another day, we see him collect fallen autumn leaves and arrange them over a pool of water into a surreal graphic gradient. Witnessing his way of seeing and collaborating with the world around him transformed me. I haven’t looked at a leaf—or twigs, or snow, or even stone—the same since.\n\n— Kelsey J. Waite, senior copy editor\n\n***\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada (streaming on FuboTV and Prime Video)\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada came out in June 2006, the same month I graduated from college. I saw it in a movie theater a few weeks into my first full-time job, and it was a revelation to watch its portrayal of the compromises, disappointments, and small victories that come with pursuing a career. The Devil Wears Prada is heightened and fantastical and unbelievable in all sorts of ways: The protagonist, Andy (the role that made me love Anne Hathaway forever), wears over-the-top clothes in an impossibly sleek office and kisses a suave older man on a lamp-lit Paris street. But the film is remarkably realistic and perceptive about work. Andy makes professional choices that alienate her from her parents, her friends, and her boyfriend. Even she doesn’t seem to fully understand why she is so determined to succeed at a job she never wanted in the first place. The film ends with her throwing her phone into a fountain and taking a job that more clearly aligns with her values and goals. But what’s stuck with me are the scenes where she is trying as hard as she can to prove to her boss, and to herself, that she can do anything that’s asked of her. Her ambition is remarkable—and it’s served as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale to me in the many years since.\n\n— Eleanor Barkhorn, senior editor\n\n***\n\nAnora (available to rent on YouTube, streaming on Hulu March 17)\n\nOf all the sex workers depicted in films, the titular protagonist of Anora—a movie that deserves at least three of its five Oscars—might be one of the few who actually feels like a worker.\n\nAt the strip club, Anora has shifts, a boss, and a mean colleague. Although sex work is technically illegal (albeit somewhat decriminalized) in New York City, she seems to have a somewhat normal job—until one night, when she gets close to Vanya, a new client. The story progresses like “Cinderella,” except the prince is the mediocre son of a Russian oligarch. Vanya marries Anora and gives her a taste of his opulent life. But when Vanya’s parents find out about the marriage, the love story is over.\n\nBefore watching Anora, I’d imagined that if work conditions improved for sex workers, they would be treated humanely. But Anora showed me—or perhaps reminded me—that society’s contempt for women in this industry is profound, and that better policies, important as they are, might never change that.\n\nThe beauty of Anora is that it never occurs to her that she is less-than. That a scion of the Russian oligarchy was never going to stay married to her seemed obvious to all of the characters—and perhaps also to the audience—but not to her. Anora screams and fights back, but even she has a limit to the amount of humiliation she can take. At the end of the movie, unable to continue holding her head high, she collapses into tears.\n\n— Gisela Salim-Peyer, associate editor\n\nHere are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\nSnow White, a live-action remake starring Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot (in theaters Friday) The Residence, a murder-mystery show about an eccentric detective who must solve a murder at a White House dinner (premieres Thursday on Netflix) Red Scare, a book by Clay Risen about McCarthyism and the anti-Communist witch hunt (out Tuesday)\n\nEssay\n\nPierre Crom / Getty\n\nMy Hometown Became a Different Country\n\nBy Tetiana Kotelnykova\n\nHorlivka had always been a Russian-speaking city, but before 2014, our graduation ceremonies and school concerts were held in Ukrainian.

The Ukrainian language vanished from classrooms. The disappearance was so abrupt and absolute that it felt unreal, like a dream whose meaning was obscure to me.

        "content": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nOn Friday, President Donald Trump delivered an unusual speech at the Justice Department. Between fulminating against his political adversaries and long digressions about the late basketball coach Bob Knight, Trump declared, “We’re restoring fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.”\n\nThen his administration spent the weekend proving otherwise.\n\nPeople who believe the press is overhyping the danger to rule of law posed by the current administration have pointed out that although administration officials have repeatedly attacked the judicial system, the White House has not actually defied a judge.\n\nBut that may not be the case anymore, or for much longer. On Saturday in Washington, D.C., Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order barring the federal government from deporting Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, which it was seeking to do using a 1798 law that bypasses much due process by declaring an enemy invasion. Nonetheless, hundreds of Venezuelans alleged by the administration to be connected with the gang Tren de Aragua landed in El Salvador, where authoritarian President Nayib Bukele has agreed to take them. Separately, a federal judge in Massachusetts is demanding to know why Rasha Alawieh, a Lebanese doctor at Brown University’s medical school, was deported despite a valid visa and a court order temporarily blocking her removal.\n\nThe White House insists that it did not actually defy Boasberg’s judicial order, but its arguments are very hard to take at face value. “The Administration did not ‘refuse to comply’ with a court order,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory.” She’s trying to have it both ways—the order is unlawful, but also we didn’t ignore it. “The written order and the Administration’s actions do not conflict,” Leavitt said.\n\nAlthough Boasberg’s written order did not specify, the judge told attorneys during the Saturday hearing that “any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.” Politico reports that the plane left during a break in the hearing, as though the government was angling to get out just ahead of any mandate. During a briefing today, Leavitt also questioned whether the verbal order held the same weight as a written order, which is a matter of settled law. During a hearing early this evening, Boasberg seemed incredulous at the Justice Department’s arguments, calling one a “heck of a stretch.”\n\nIn the Boston case, a Customs and Border Protection official said in a sworn declaration that the agency had not received formal notification of the judge’s order when it deported Alawieh. CBP said in a statement yesterday that “arriving aliens bear the burden of establishing admissibility to the United States.”\n\nThe statements of Trump administration officials elsewhere make it even harder to take their actions as anything other than attempting to defy judges. Salvadoran President Bukele posted a screenshot of a New York Post story about the judge’s order on X with the commentary, “Oopsie … Too late” and a laughing-crying emoji. Chief Bureaucrat Elon Musk replied with the same emoji, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio shared Bukele’s post from his own account. “Border czar” Tom Homan appeared on Fox News this morning and said, “We’re not stopping. I don’t care what the judges think. I don’t care what the left thinks. We’re coming.”\n\nThese actions should be terrifying no matter who is involved. The fact that Tren de Aragua is indeed a vicious gang doesn’t nullify the law—the administration’s claim that the U.S. is contending with a wartime invasion is ridiculous on its face. Even more important is whether the White House decided to snub a ruling by a federal judge. Nor do customs officials’ claims in court filings that they found “sympathetic photos and videos” of Hezbollah leaders on Alawieh’s phone, or that she told them she had attended the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah’s funeral, mean the law doesn’t apply. For all we know, her actions may well justify her deportation. (Of course, we have little way of assessing any of these allegations clearly, because the administration has sidestepped the usual judicial proceedings in both cases. A lawyer for Alawieh’s family hasn’t commented on the allegations.) What matters is that the executive branch acted despite a judge’s order.\n\nThis is what we might call the Mahmoud Khalil test: No matter whether you think someone’s ideas or actions are deplorable, once the executive branch decides it doesn’t have to follow the law for one person, it has established that it doesn’t have to follow the law for anyone. After Khalil was arrested, Trump said that he was “the first arrest of many to come.” No one should have any illusion that the list will stop with alleged Tren de Aragua members. Throughout his career, Trump has tested boundaries and, if allowed to do so, pushed further. His actions at the start of this term show that he is more emboldened than ever, and traditionally institutionalist figures such as Rubio seem eager to abet him.\n\nWatching Trump’s DOJ address, supposedly about law and order, offers some ideas of who else he might target while ignoring the law. So do his social-media accounts. This morning on Truth Social, Trump claimed that former President Joe Biden’s pardons of Liz Cheney and other members of the House January 6 Committee were not valid. “The ‘Pardons’ that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,” Trump wrote. “In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!”\n\nTrump wouldn’t bother with this if he didn’t hope to prosecute the people involved. Although Biden’s pardons were controversial because they were issued preemptively, the idea that an autopen, which allows the user to sign remotely, would invalidate them is concocted out of thin air. (Nor has Trump provided evidence that Biden did in fact use an autopen in these cases.) The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel wrote a justification for the practice in 2005, and presidents have been using them to sign legislation since 2011, without serious incident. The Supreme Court could conceivably rule in favor of Trump’s view—the justices have adopted other long-shot Trump claims—but it is hard to imagine, and would be a real departure.\n\nWhen Trump speaks about law and order, he means it very narrowly. He believes in swift justice for his adversaries, with or without due process of the law; meanwhile, he believes his actions should not be constrained by law, the Constitution, or anything else that might cause him problems, and he has used pardons prolifically to excuse the actions of his friends and allies, whether Paul Manafort and Roger Stone or January 6 rioters. Plenty of presidents have been frustrated by the limitations of the law. Richard Nixon even claimed, years after leaving office, that any action by the president, as head of the executive branch, is de facto legal. But no president until now has so aggressively or so frequently acted as though he didn’t need to follow the law’s most basic precepts.\n\nBack in November, my colleague Tom Nichols invoked the Peruvian politician Óscar Benavides. Though he’s little known in the United States, here are a few striking facts about him: He served as president twice, first coming to power not through a popular election but through appointment by an elected assembly. Some years later, he returned to the presidency as an unabashed authoritarian. (Hmm.) “For my friends, everything; for my enemies, the law,” goes a quote sometimes attributed to Benavides. It could be the motto of the Trump administration over the past four days.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nAt least 42 people died after a powerful storm system hit central and southern U.S. states over the weekend, according to officials. The Energy Department, EPA, and NOAA started hiring back probationary employees after federal judges recently ruled that their firings were illegally carried out and ordered their reinstatement. Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to speak on the phone tomorrow about a cease-fire with Ukraine. Trump said yesterday that he expects the conversation to include discussions about Ukraine’s power plants, and that there have already been talks about “dividing up” Ukrainian assets.\n\nDispatches\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nIllustration by Jonelle Afurong / The Atlantic.

Plenty of women, of course, consume and enjoy or create and profit from porn—people of every sexual orientation and gender identity do. But the force that through the green fuse drives the flower (and the money) is heterosexual male desire for women. And here was porn so good, so varied, so ready to please, so instantly—insistently—available, that it led to a generation of men who think of porn not as a backup to having sex, but as an improvement on it.

        "title": "Who Wants to Live in the Palisades Now?",
        "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/",
        "content": "The Palisades Fire burned its way through Jennifer Champion’s life. It started in the hills where her family liked to hike and moved along the roads she took with her daughters to Elysse’s high school (burned), Annabelle’s middle school (partially burned), and Charlise’s day care (too damaged to use). Nearby, her husband owned three sober-living facilities (one burned; the other two are now uninhabitable, surrounded by rubble). The roof and front wall collapsed at the grocery store where Charlise would get free sprinkle cookies; the one down the street is a pile of warped steel. Champion’s family had lived in the Palisades for about 16 years and, two years ago, leased a house they’d hoped to stay in long-term. That home burned. So did most of the other ones on their street.\n\nNow they are living about 45 minutes away, in Manhattan Beach, where some other Palisades friends relocated too. “Is it convenient for all of us? None of us,” Champion told me, but they wanted to stay together. Elysse transferred to a high school in Santa Monica, about an hour away in traffic, with Palisades friends; Annabelle’s school found a temporary location there too. Champion’s job at Pepperdine University can be nearly two hours away. But she isn’t sure she will be able to keep it anyway, especially now that they don’t have child care for Charlise.\n\nThey are past the first days of the fire—evacuating, securing temporary housing—and the first few weeks—finding a long-term rental, furnishing it with donations from a friend, buying pillows and cutlery. But “none of us know what to do next,” Champion said. Her Palisades friends talk: Do they stay where they are and make Manhattan Beach their home? Rebuilding the Palisades will take years. But right now, they all want to go back if they can.\n\nIn January, I drove through Altadena, the other neighborhood destroyed by that month’s fires, with Frank Bigelow, Cal Fire’s deputy director of wildfire preparedness. At lot after lot after lot, the only bit of house still standing was the chimney. The air was acrid and quiet. To Bigelow, the scene recalled an image from a 1961 fire that razed Bel Air, about five miles from the Palisades. (Local legend in Malibu holds that the town’s flock of colorful parrots is descended from pets that escaped Bel Air’s burning homes.)\n\nThe L.A. Fire Department produced a documentary postmortem a year later about all the ways the city had built itself flammable. That old film, he told me, “speaks to every one of the issues we saw” in January—a brush fire that quickly became an urban one; clogged evacuation routes; hydrants running dry; houses built on steep hillsides, where flames travel fastest. Bigelow rewatches it every few years. At the end, over black-and-white footage of a rubble neighborhood, the narrator intones: “Now fireplaces stand as tombstones over row upon row of dead homes on dead streets.” As we drove, Bigelow pointed to the chimneys. “Tombstones,” he said.\n\nAfter the 1961 fire, people kept building in Bel Air and into the hills. My father grew up one neighborhood over and, in the 1970s, bought a plot of land in the mountains of Topanga Canyon, overlooking Malibu, where I grew up. And all of the ignition points that humans brought in—power lines, heavy equipment, cars, cigarette butts—started more fires than the land was adapted to handle. Southern California’s chaparral needs fire to regenerate, but historically, it burned only every 30 to 100 years, Alexandra Syphard, a senior research scientist at the Conservation Biology Institute, told me. More frequent fires meant it no longer had enough time to recover between burns, so non-native grasses—far more flammable—filled the gaps. Over time, the landscape has become more and more fit to burn. When a wildfire came through my neighborhood in 1993, it traced a similar path to a fire from 1970, and traveled through burn scars from seven other fires. That 1993 conflagration lapped at the windows of my childhood home; the Palisades Fire finally burned it down.\n\nRead: The place where I grew up is gone\n\nCalifornia has tried to build for the inevitable. After the Bel Air fire, Los Angeles updated its building codes, outlawing wood-shingled roofs and mandating that homeowners clear the brush around their house. Since 2008, the state has required that new homes in extremely fire-prone areas—such as my childhood neighborhood and much of the Palisades—have fire-resistant siding, tempered glass, and ember-resistant eves and vents. Many homes in the Palisades were constructed long before 2008 and, when they’re rebuilt, will be brought up to those standards. Fire can consume even the most defensible house, but if everyone designs less flammably, the whole neighborhood is less likely to go, Emily Schlickman, a fire-resiliency researcher at UC Davis, told me. In her ideal world, high-risk communities would have a ring of cleared land around them as a firebreak, robbing the flames of fuel. The local government in Paradise, California, which was destroyed by the 2018 Camp Fire, is trying to buy up land around the community to do precisely that. But many vulnerable places forgo such measures because they could do everything right and burn anyway.\n\nLos Angeles is still trying to decide how to remake its destroyed neighborhoods. A commission of volunteer experts will give the county recommendations on reconstructing (and retrofitting) the area for future disasters. Steve Soboroff, the real-estate developer whom Mayor Karen Bass appointed chief recovery officer, has promised that the Palisades will be rebuilt resiliently (and, also, somehow have their Fourth of July parade this year). And the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power recently pledged to put all of the Palisades’ power lines underground. In the days after the fire, some Angelenos and experts also advocated for dramatically remaking the Palisades—to be denser, for instance, with firebreaks around the community—but those notions may already be more or less moot. Many residents simply want to get home as quickly as possible, and the city and state have waived certain permitting requirements for those who want to rebuild essentially their same house on the same lot.\n\nEvery time these fires wreak this level of damage, people look at the melted cars, curled stucco, and thousands of displaced residents and ask: Should human beings return to these places at all? “When most of us build or buy a home, we carefully appraise the neighborhood. In Malibu the neighborhood is fire. Fire that revisits the coastal mountains several times a decade,” Mike Davis wrote in his famous essay “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn.” (You can tell what he thought of our whole shrubland coastal-living experiment.) Taxpayer dollars helped rebuild these areas, many occupied by rich people, again and again and again. Why not just accept that this coastline is kindling and move on?\n\nBut abandoning these landscapes altogether just isn’t realistic, researchers told me. Almost a third of all housing in the continental U.S. is already in places where settlements and wilderness intermix. All those people can’t just move. And abandonment isn’t always the best way to manage fires, either. Move everyone out of these half-wild places, and you may have taken away the people who were clearing brush and otherwise reducing the fire risk for the city nearby, Miriam Greenberg, a disaster researcher at UC Santa Cruz who studies the wildland-urban interface, told me. Leaving these areas untouched, Greenberg said, means “the potential for future disasters increases significantly for those adjacent urban areas, which is most of California.”\n\nPeople have chosen to live here, with fire, for generations. My classmate and her father attended the same middle school; my friends’ parents and grandparents have been in Malibu for decades. A friend recently walked me through his home, which was severely smoke-damaged in the Palisades Fire and which, he told me, was a rebuild: The house had burned down in the 1993 fire. I asked if he’d ever leave, and he laughed: “When I die, I guess.”\n\nMost displaced residents I spoke with want to come home. Ginny Wiley, now in her 80s, grew up in her grandfather’s store, a wooden shack called Wiley’s Bait and Tackle, and took it over decades later. She used to live behind the shop, in what had once been a cottage-style motel for the construction workers who built the Pacific Coast Highway. When the state bought the bungalows to preserve as a historic site, Wiley moved into an apartment in the Pacific Palisades. The fire leveled Wiley’s Bait, the bungalows, and her apartment; she lived in her car for a month and then in a temporary Airbnb. She told me she hopes to rebuild: “I’m going to stay with the store as long as I can.”\n\nInsurance helps. But in my community, the difference between “good” and “okay” coverage is already determining people’s futures. Lisa Machenberg and her husband are going to rent nearby while building a home with enough room for future grandchildren; the Amirani family, whose daughter I used to play softball with, hope to live in a trailer on their burned lot, if they can afford to rebuild. Their private insurer dropped them a few years ago—one of the many companies that stopped writing policies in California—and the Amiranis estimate that their coverage will foot only about half the cost of construction.\n\nRenters like Jennifer Champion and her family have no guarantee that they can return to the neighborhood. The Champions asked their landlord if they could purchase his burned lot, but he doesn’t plan to sell. Jennifer’s eldest daughter reminds her that, by the time the Palisades take form again, she will be away at college. Still, the Champions have added themselves to a directory, Protect Pali, that matches people looking to live in the Palisades with residents who want to sell their land.\n\nRead: How to rebuild from the ashes\n\nBecause not everyone wants to come back. Jane Warden refuses to rebuild. In 2018, when the Woolsey Fire came through the western half of Malibu (spared by the Palisades Fire this year), it burned down the home where she’d raised her children and spent 10 years growing a garden of eucalyptus, palm trees, and pine trees—highly flammable plants that are everywhere in this part of California. Nick Tinoco, a sociologist at UCLA, followed people in Woolsey’s aftermath and told me that most people he’d spoken with had initially planned to rebuild. But only about 40 percent of the homes lost in that fire have been. The reality, Tinoco found, “was two-plus years of them trying to rebuild and then reaching a point where it was either better for them financially or psychically to let go and move on,” even if only to the next town over. (Trees in the canyons are still black from Woolsey; my prom date’s house is now an overgrown lot of mustard and jimson weed.) People tend to think climate migration is driven by the desire to flee a hazardous place, Tinoco said, but really, it is a by-product of “the long process of trying to stay.”\n\nWarden had originally planned to rebuild too, but she got so fed up with permitting that she sold her lot; the buyer quickly built a giant house, and sold it for four times what Warden had paid for the original, she told me. She moved to a neighborhood on the other side of Malibu so her kids could stay in the same school. She started a new garden of less flammable native plants and made a five-foot hardscape perimeter of sand and gravel around her home. The Palisades Fire burned down her house again anyway, and most of her neighborhood.\n\nHer HOA is talking about using factory-built homes when their community rebuilds. “It makes sense, right? Because then you can replace your house easily, if we start thinking of housing as more semipermanent,” she told me. But she personally plans never to live in Malibu again. Losing a house to fire “twice is okay, but three times starts to feel like carelessness,” she said. She will replace her Christmas ornaments for the second time, but she has given up on keeping a personal library and has been leaving books wherever she finishes them. She and her husband are considering moving to the East Coast or to nearby Santa Monica, where the fire risk is generally lower (although portions of it were evacuated in January).\n\nFire is a brutal sorting mechanism, deciding who can actually afford to live in a place and who can’t. More money generally enters an area after a fire, because they tend to happen in coveted landscapes, Kathryn McConnell, a disaster sociologist at the University of British Columbia, told me. Five years after Northern California’s Camp Fire, home prices in Paradise have gone up, and so has the number of houses sold that were built on spec, according to a study published last month. Only about five of the area’s 30 mobile-home parks have been rebuilt. The Palisades and Malibu are already extraordinarily expensive places to live; the fires will likely make them more so. The median home price in the Palisades is north of $4 million, and the median income is a little less than $200,000. Some people have been living in the homes their grandparents bought years ago or, like my parents, in mobile-home parks (two of which burned in the Palisades). But after a fire, rebuilding an old house can be financially impossible, especially if it was underinsured, and mobile-home parks might never reopen if the owners decide to sell and move on.\n\nSo far, investors have been the earliest buyers of the burnt lots that people have put on the market. The first one sold in the Palisades belonged to an art teacher, who asked for $999,000 and got about $1.2 million. Richard Schulman, the real-estate agent who brokered the deal, told me that the buyer is a real-estate investor who plans to either build a spec home to sell or just sit on the land for a few years until more people move back and the property values rise.\n\nSchulman is bullish on the Palisades. “This is very valuable land to be on,” he said—secluded yet convenient, with ocean views and a sea breeze. Last month, I stood with him in a leveled townhouse complex along the road where, during the fire, evacuating residents abandoned their vehicles and ran. A mudslide had since closed the lower half of it. “I’m 99 percent sure this is the unit here,” Schulman said, indicating some undulating stucco indistinguishable from the other undulating stucco. He told me that this particular pile was a condo he’d recently listed—a great buy, he said, for a highly speculative investor.\n\nA small patch of grass on the burnt hillside was still alive. Schulman pointed at the unburnt bit: “If you look at it the right way, it’s like, This is beautiful. There’s trees; there’s green.” The air smelled of eucalyptus and dead fish, which were lying on the walkway beside us. They had survived the fire, only for the recent rains to wash them out of the community pond. Schulman made a picture frame out of his thumbs and forefingers and held it toward the hill. “If you ignore the burnt hillside back there,” he said, “this is a great place to live.”",

        "content": "is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.\n\nThe AI world is moving so fast that it’s easy to get lost amid the flurry of shiny new products. OpenAI announces one, then the Chinese startup DeepSeek releases one, then OpenAI immediately puts out another one. Each is important, but focus too much on any one of them and you’ll miss the really big story of the past six months.\n\nThe big story is: AI companies now claim that their models are capable of genuine reasoning — the type of thinking you and I do when we want to solve a problem.\n\nAnd the big question is: Is that true?\n\nThe stakes are high, because the answer will inform how everyone from your mom to your government should — and should not — turn to AI for help.\n\nIf you’ve played around with ChatGPT, you know that it was designed to spit out quick answers to your questions. But state-of-the-art “reasoning models” — like OpenAI’s o1 or DeepSeek’s r1 — are designed to “think” a while before responding, by breaking down big problems into smaller problems and trying to solve them step by step. The industry calls that “chain-of-thought reasoning.”\n\nThese models are yielding some very impressive results. They can solve tricky logic puzzles, ace math tests, and write flawless code on the first try. Yet they also fail spectacularly on really easy problems.\n\nAI experts are torn over how to interpret this. Skeptics take it as evidence that “reasoning” models aren’t really reasoning at all. Believers insist that the models genuinely are doing some reasoning, and though it may not currently be as flexible as a human’s reasoning, it’s well on its way to getting there.\n\nSo, who’s right?\n\nThe best answer will be unsettling to both the hard skeptics of AI and the true believers.\n\nWhat counts as reasoning?\n\nLet’s take a step back. What exactly is reasoning, anyway?\n\nAI companies like OpenAI are using the term reasoning to mean that their models break down a problem into smaller problems, which they tackle step by step, ultimately arriving at a better solution as a result.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

Although scientists are still trying to understand how reasoning works in the human brain — nevermind in AI — they agree that there are actually lots of different types of reasoning.\n\nThere’s deductive reasoning, where you start with a general statement and use it to reach a specific conclusion. There’s inductive reasoning, where you use specific observations to make a broader generalization. And there’s analogical reasoning, causal reasoning, common sense reasoning … suffice it to say, reasoning is not just one thing!\n\nNow, if someone comes up to you with a hard math problem and gives you a chance to break it down and think about it step by step, you’ll do a lot better than if you have to blurt out the answer off the top of your head. So, being able to do deliberative “chain-of-thought reasoning” is definitely helpful, and it might be a necessary ingredient of getting anything really difficult done. Yet it’s not the whole of reasoning.\n\nOne feature of reasoning that we care a lot about in the real world is the ability to suss out “a rule or pattern from limited data or experience and to apply this rule or pattern to new, unseen situations,” writes Melanie Mitchell, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute, together with her co-authors in a paper on AI’s reasoning abilities. “Even very young children are adept at learning abstract rules from just a few examples.”\n\nIn other words, a toddler can generalize. Can an AI?\n\nA lot of the debate turns around this question. Skeptics are very, well, skeptical of AI’s ability to generalize. They think something else is going on.\n\nThe skeptic’s case\n\n“It’s a kind of meta-mimicry,” Shannon Vallor, a philosopher of technology at the University of Edinburgh, told me when OpenAI’s o1 came out in September.\n\nShe meant that while an older model like ChatGPT mimics the human-written statements in its training data, a newer model like o1 mimics the process that humans engage in to come up with those statements. In other words, she believes, it’s not truly reasoning. It would be pretty easy for o1 to just make it sound like it’s reasoning; after all, its training data is rife with examples of that, from doctors analyzing symptoms to decide on a diagnosis to judges evaluating evidence to arrive at a verdict.\n\nBesides, when OpenAI built the o1 model, it made some changes from the previous ChatGPT model but did not dramatically overhaul the architecture — and ChatGPT was flubbing easy questions last year, like answering a question about how to get a man and a goat across a river in a totally ridiculous way. So why, Vallor asked, would we think o1 is doing something totally new and magical — especially given that it, too, flubs easy questions? “In the cases where it fails, you see what, for me, is compelling evidence that it’s not reasoning at all,” she said.\n\nMitchell was surprised at how well o3 — OpenAI’s newest reasoning model, announced at the end of last year as a successor to o1 — performed on tests. But she was also surprised at just how much computation it used to solve the problems. We don’t know what it’s doing with all that computation, because OpenAI is not transparent about what’s going on under the hood.\n\n“I’ve actually done my own experiments on people where they’re thinking out loud about these problems, and they don’t think out loud for, you know, hours of computation time,” she told me. “They just say a couple sentences and then say, ‘Yeah, I see how it works,’ because they’re using certain kinds of concepts. I don’t know if o3 is using those kinds of concepts.”\n\nWithout greater transparency from the company, Mitchell said we can’t be sure that the model is breaking down a big problem into steps and getting a better overall answer as a result of that approach, as OpenAI claims.\n\nShe pointed to a paper, “Let’s Think Dot by Dot,” where researchers did not get a model to break down a problem into intermediate steps; instead, they just told the model to generate dots. Those dots were totally meaningless — what the paper’s authors call “filler tokens.” But it turned out that just having additional tokens there allowed the model more computational capacity, and it could use that extra computation to solve problems better. That suggests that when a model generates intermediate steps — whether it’s a phrase like “let’s think about this step by step” or just “....” — those steps don’t necessarily mean it’s doing the human-like reasoning you think it’s doing.\n\n“I think a lot of what it’s doing is more like a bag of heuristics than a reasoning model,” Mitchell told me. A heuristic is a mental shortcut — something that often lets you guess the right answer to a problem, but not by actually thinking it through.\n\nHere’s a classic example: Researchers trained an AI vision model to analyze photos for skin cancer. It seemed, at first blush, like the model was genuinely figuring out if a mole is malignant. But it turned out the photos of malignant moles in its training data often contained a ruler, so the model had just learned to use the presence of a ruler as a heuristic for deciding on malignancy.\n\nSkeptical AI researchers think that state-of-the-art models may be doing something similar: They appear to be “reasoning” their way through, say, a math problem, but really they’re just drawing on a mix of memorized information and heuristics.\n\nThe believer’s case\n\nOther experts are more bullish on reasoning models. Ryan Greenblatt, chief scientist at Redwood Research, a nonprofit that aims to mitigate risks from advanced AI, thinks these models are pretty clearly doing some form of reasoning.\n\n“They do it in a way that doesn’t generalize as well as the way humans do it — they’re relying more on memorization and knowledge than humans do — but they’re still doing the thing,” Greenblatt said. “It’s not like there’s no generalization at all.”\n\nAfter all, these models have been able to solve hard problems beyond the examples they’ve been trained on — often very impressively. For Greenblatt, the simplest explanation as to how is that they are indeed doing some reasoning.\n\nAnd the point about heuristics can cut both ways, whether we’re talking about a reasoning model or an earlier model like ChatGPT. Consider the “a man, a boat, and a goat” prompt that had many skeptics mocking OpenAI last year:\n\nWhat’s going on here? Greenblatt says the model messed up because this prompt is actually a classic logic puzzle that dates back centuries and that would have appeared many times in the training data. In some formulations of the river-crossing puzzle, a farmer with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage must cross over by boat. The boat can only carry the farmer and a single item at a time — but if left together, the wolf will eat the goat or the goat will eat the cabbage, so the challenge is to get everything across without anything getting eaten. That explains the model’s mention of a cabbage in its response. The model would instantly “recognize” the puzzle.\n\n“My best guess is that the models have this incredibly strong urge to be like, ‘Oh, it’s this puzzle! I know what this puzzle is! I should do this because that performed really well in the training data.’ It’s like a learned heuristic,” Greenblatt said. The implication? “It’s not that it can’t solve it. In a lot of these cases, if you say it’s a trick question, and then you give the question, the model often does totally fine.”\n\nHumans fail in the same way all the time, he pointed out. If you’d just spent a month studying color theory — from complementary colors to the psychological effects of different hues to the historical significance of certain pigments in Renaissance paintings — and then got a quiz asking, “Why did the artist paint the sky blue in this landscape painting?”... well, you might be tricked into writing a needlessly complicated answer! Maybe you’d write about how the blue represents the divine heavens, or how the specific shade suggests the painting was done in the early morning hours which symbolizes rebirth … when really, the answer is simply: Because the sky is blue!\n\nAjeya Cotra, a senior analyst at Open Philanthropy who researches the risks from AI, agrees with Greenblatt on that point. And, she said of the latest models, “I think they’re genuinely getting better at this wide range of tasks that humans would call reasoning tasks.”\n\nShe doesn’t dispute that the models are doing some meta-mimicry. But when skeptics say “it’s just doing meta-mimicry,” she explained, “I think the ‘just’ part of it is the controversial part. It feels like what they’re trying to imply often is ‘and therefore it’s not going to have a big impact on the world’ or ‘and therefore artificial superintelligence is far away’ — and that’s what I dispute.”\n\nTo see why, she said, imagine you’re teaching a college physics class. You’ve got different types of students. One is an outright cheater: He just looks in the back of the book for the answers and then writes them down. Another student is such a savant that he doesn’t even need to think about the equations; he understands the physics on such a deep, intuitive, Einstein-like level that he can derive the right equations on the fly. All the other students are somewhere in the middle: They’ve memorized a list of 25 equations and are trying to figure out which equation to apply in which situation.\n\nLike the majority of students, AI models are pairing some memorization with some reasoning, Cotra told me.\n\n“The AI models are like a student that is not very bright but is superhumanly diligent, and so they haven’t just memorized 25 equations, they’ve memorized 500 equations, including ones for weird situations that could come up,” she said. They’re pairing a lot of memorization with a little bit of reasoning — that is, with figuring out what combination of equations to apply to a problem. “And that just takes you very far! They seem at first glance as impressive as the person with the deep intuitive understanding.”\n\nOf course, when you look harder, you can still find holes that their 500 equations just happen not to cover. But that doesn’t mean zero reasoning has taken place.\n\nIn other words, the models are neither exclusively reasoning nor exclusively just reciting.\n\n“It’s somewhere in between,” Cotra said. “I think people are thrown off by that because they want to put it in one camp or another. They want to say it’s just memorizing or they want to say it’s truly deeply reasoning. But the fact is, there’s just a spectrum of the depth of reasoning.”\n\nAI systems have “jagged intelligence”\n\nResearchers have come up with a buzzy term to describe this pattern of reasoning: “jagged intelligence.” It refers to the strange fact that, as computer scientist Andrej Karpathy explained, state-of-the-art AI models “can both perform extremely impressive tasks (e.g., solve complex math problems) while simultaneously struggling with some very dumb problems.”\n\nDrew Shannon for Vox\n\nPicture it like this. If human intelligence looks like a cloud with softly rounded edges, artificial intelligence is like a spiky cloud with giant peaks and valleys right next to each other. In humans, a lot of problem-solving capabilities are highly correlated with each other, but AI can be great at one thing and ridiculously bad at another thing that (to us) doesn’t seem far apart.\n\nMind you, it’s all relative.\n\n“Compared to what humans are good at, the models are quite jagged,” Greenblatt told me. “But I think indexing on humans is a little confusing. From the model’s perspective, it’s like, ‘Wow, those humans are so jagged! They’re so bad at next-token prediction!’ It’s not clear that there’s some objective sense in which AI is more jagged.”\n\nThe fact that reasoning models are trained to sound like humans reasoning makes us disposed to compare AI intelligence to human intelligence. But the best way to think of AI is probably not as “smarter than a human” or “dumber than a human” but just as “different.”\n\nRegardless, Cotra anticipates that sooner or later AI intelligence will be so vast that it can contain within it all of human intelligence, and then some.\n\n“I think about, what are the risks that emerge when AI systems are truly better than human experts at everything? When they might still be jagged, but their full jagged intelligence encompasses all of human intelligence and more?” she said. “I’m always looking ahead to that point in time and preparing for that.”\n\nFor now, the practical upshot for most of us is this: Remember what AI is and isn’t smart at — and use it accordingly.\n\nThe best use case is a situation where it’s hard for you to come up with a solution, but once you get a solution from the AI you can easily check to see if it’s correct. Writing code is a perfect example. Another example would be making a website: You can see what the AI produced and, if you don’t like it, just get the AI to redo it.\n\nIn other domains — especially ones where there is no objective right answer or where the stakes are high — you’ll want to be more hesitant about using AI. You might get some initial suggestions from it, but don’t put too much stock in it, especially if what it’s saying seems off to you. An example would be asking for advice on how to handle a moral dilemma. You might see what thoughts the model is provoking in you without trusting it as giving you the final answer.\n\n“The more things are fuzzy and judgment-driven,” Cotra said, “the more you want to use it as a thought partner, not an oracle.”",

        "title": "Has Trump already killed NATO?",
        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox covering foreign policy and world news with a focus on the future of international conflict. He is the author of the 2018 book, Invisible Countries: Journeys to the Edge of Nationhood , an exploration of border conflicts, unrecognized countries, and changes to the world map.\n\nUS President Donald Trump meets with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 13, 2025. Mandel Ngan/AFP\n\nThroughout his first term as president, Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to leave NATO, an alliance that in his view allows other countries who don’t spend enough on their own defense to get a free ride on US security guarantees. His former national security adviser John Bolton has written that he believes Trump would have followed through on the threat if he’d been reelected in 2020.\n\nThis term, though, despite deepening tensions with Europe, Trump hasn’t said much about leaving the alliance. His secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, has avowed, “The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defense partnership with Europe. Full stop.”\n\nAt this point, the better question is whether Trump has effectively made the alliance irrelevant. The US is still a NATO member. But Trump has consistently undermined its core principle that members will treat any attack on another member’s territory as an attack on their own, and come to the attacked member’s aid.\n\nThis principle of mutual defense only works if both the allies and their adversaries believe that it’s credible — that countries would actually put the lives of their own citizens on the line to defend allies.\n\nIn the case of Trump and NATO, the guarantee is getting a lot harder to believe.\n\n”Would Donald Trump choose to go and fight for Estonia?” said Dalibor Rohac, a senior fellow and expert on European politics at the American Enterprise Institute. “I think at some level, it requires a suspension of disbelief to think that he would.”\n\nTrump’s second term has already been far more alarming, from a European perspective than the first, thanks to actions including Trump’s abrupt pivot toward Russia in the Ukraine war, the Oval Office humiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his new tariffs, JD Vance’s combative speech at the Munich Security Conference, the territorial threats toward NATO members Canada and Denmark, and reports that the president is considering redeploying troops from Germany to Russia-friendly Hungary.\n\nEuropean leaders might have thought of Trump’s first term as an aberration, a bizarre four years followed by a return to normalcy. His return to the White House made clear they may be dealing with a very different United States going forward — one whose security commitments can’t be taken for granted in the long run, even if Trump is replaced by another Joe Biden-style transatlanticist in four years.\n\nRecent statements from European leaders suggest they are not so confident about the credibility of America’s commitment to the alliance. “I want to believe that the US will stand by our side, but we have to be ready for that not to be the case,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a recent televised speech to the nation.\n\n“Strategic autonomy” from Washington has long been a priority for Macron, and something of a French tradition dating back to the formation of the alliance. It was more surprising to hear Germany’s likely incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz, hailing from a center-right party with a strong transatlanticist tradition, say that “After Donald Trump’s statements…it is clear that the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe” and that Europe must work as quickly as possible to “achieve independence from the US.”\n\nSome of this work will involve steps to increase defense spending, military readiness, and aid to Ukraine that are already underway. There have also been increasing conversations on the continent about developing an independent nuclear deterrent, outside of Washington’s control.\n\nEither way, it’s clear that the alliance that has been the bedrock of Western security strategy for nearly 80 years is no longer what it was. Without actually leaving it, Trump may have simply made NATO irrelevant.\n\nDoes the heart of the NATO treaty even still exist?\n\nThe core of the NATO alliance is spelled out in Article 5 of the alliance’s founding treaty: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”\n\nIn the event of such an attack, each member pledges to “such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”\n\nIn practice, this guarantee was an effective deterrent to first the Soviet Union, and then Russia, because of the involvement of the United States, the NATO country with by far the largest conventional military and nuclear arsenal.\n\nWashington has had fierce disagreements with other NATO members in the past: the war in Iraq, for example. Trump is also hardly the first president to suggest that America’s core interests lie elsewhere — Barack Obama also tried to execute a “pivot to Asia” — or that European countries should take more responsibility for their own defense.\n\nBut the current hostility to the very idea of the alliance is unprecedented. “It has been core to every administration until now to affirm in a positive way that the United States is committed to the defense of Europe, that it is committed to Article 5,” said Ivo Daalder, who served as US ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration. “That is the cornerstone of our engagement in the world.”\n\nBut, Daalder added, “Trump has, from 2016 onwards, put question marks behind that commitment.”\n\nIt’s not just Trump’s threats to leave the alliance. He has called into question whether the US would follow its obligations under the treaty at all. In 2020, he reportedly told European officials, in a closed-door meeting, “You need to understand that if Europe is under attack, we will never come to help you and to support you.”\n\nDuring his 2020 campaign, he said he would invite Russia to do “whatever the hell you want” to “delinquent” members of the alliance.\n\nDuring a recent meeting with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said his “biggest problem” with NATO is that he doubts whether the mutual defense clause would work in practice, saying, “If the United States was in trouble and we called them, we said, we got a problem…do you think they’re going to come and protect us? They’re supposed to. I’m not so sure.”\n\nArticle 5 has been invoked exactly once since NATO’s founding in 1949: after the 9/11 attacks on the United States. The alliance did come to America’s aid. Soldiers from over a dozen NATO countries died in the war in Afghanistan that followed.\n\nThe other ostensible reason for Trump’s ire during his first term was the failure of most NATO members to meet a target, set in 2014, of spending at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense. In 2021, just six member countries hit that goal.\n\nBut things have changed since then: 23 of the alliance’s 32 members now meet the 2 percent target.\n\nTrump can, with some justification, take a victory lap for this change (though Vladimir Putin surely deserves more credit). And during a meeting at the White House last week, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte praised him for prodding members to spend more. But Trump has also upped the ante, saying European countries should be spending 5 percent on defense, more than any NATO country, including the United States currently spends.\n\nNBC recently reported that Trump is considering calibrating America’s NATO membership so that it is not bound to defend countries that don’t meet a set spending target.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine how this would work in practice. The countries on NATO’s Eastern flank, like Poland and the Baltic countries, which are the most concerned about being attacked by Russia, are already spending the most on defense. (Officials from these countries often point out that they spend more, as a percentage of GDP, than the United States.) And the right-wing parties in Europe that the Trump administration has publicly aligned itself with, including Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz and France’s National Rally, are the ones blocking higher defense spending at both a national and continent-wide level.\n\nTrump’s calls for higher spending often seem less like a genuine policy demand than a cudgel to wield against an alliance he doesn’t much care for in the first place.\n\nTrump’s statements, Daalder said, have “weakened the confidence that allies feel to the point that, I would argue, allies now are no longer convinced that, in fact, the United States is committed to Article 5.”\n\nAnd if they are no longer convinced, it’s fair to ask whether Article 5, de facto, still exists.\n\nEurope’s nuclear future\n\nFor the moment, “the dominant strategy for European governments is to kind of try to act as if NATO didn’t exist and make sure that they are ready to face the dangers alone,” Rohac said.\n\nSome of this will involve increasing defense spending and increasing and building up conventional capabilities. Parties in Germany, for instance, agreed this week to a historic deal to exempt defense spending from the country’s constitutionally enshrined limits on government borrowing.\n\nBut from its founding, the NATO alliance and Article 5 have also been tied to nuclear strategy and French President Charles de Gaulle’s famous question of whether the US would be willing to “trade New York for Paris” in the event of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.\n\n“The ability of the United States to reassure allies that it’s willing to destroy itself in a nuclear war to defend them is a difficult case to make under the best of circumstances,” Daalder said. “It’s a nearly impossible case to make under the present circumstances.”\n\nEven before Trump returned to office, there had been increasing debate on the continent about whether Europe needs to build out nuclear deterrence independent of Washington. Currently, two European countries have nuclear weapons of their own. Britain’s are assigned to NATO, and experts question whether its program could even survive without US support; France has a fully independent deterrent.\n\nThe US also maintains an arsenal of around 100 B61 gravity bombs — the smallest nukes in the US arsenal but still big enough to kill thousands if detonated over a city — in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and Turkey.\n\nIn his recent speech, Macron repeated an offer he has made several times in the past to extend the protection of France’s nuclear arsenal to other European countries. In a recent speech, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he was taking Macron’s offer seriously and that Poland “must reach for the most modern capabilities also related to nuclear weapons and modern unconventional weapons.”\n\nThe ability to rely on the US for nuclear deterrence is one reason far fewer countries have nuclear weapons today than many expected at the dawn of the nuclear age. For instance, the US convinced what was then West Germany to renounce the development of nuclear weapons of its own in exchange for protection under the US nuclear umbrella.\n\nBut if allies concluded that extended deterrence is a sham, further proliferation seems inevitable.\n\nRussia is watching\n\nIf NATO allies their doubts about the reliability of Article 5, it seems inevitable that the alliance’s adversaries may start to doubt it as well.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has, in many ways, been the ultimate demonstration of the value of NATO: Despite billions of dollars in weapons and aid crossing Ukraine’s borders, Russia has not directly attacked Poland or any other NATO country’s territory. Hostile as he may be to NATO, Putin does appear to respect Article 5.\n\nBut for how long? “With the threats that Russia is voicing toward the Baltic states, toward Poland, toward Finland, of course we are worried,” Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said during a meeting with reporters on a recent visit to Washington. “Their military capability is growing even while waging full-scale war in Ukraine.”\n\nGiven the difficulties it’s had and is still having in Ukraine, it’s hard to imagine Russia launching an all-out invasion of another country, let alone a NATO member, in the next few years. But Russia has been carrying out more alleged “gray zone” attacks on Western countries, ranging from election interference to maritime sabotage to arson.\n\nResponding and deterring attacks like these is already a challenge, given the difficulties involved in definitely attributing them to Russia and the fact that they fall short of the kind of armed aggression envisioned in the NATO treaty. But they could well get more aggressive if NATO’s commitment to mutual defense starts to look less ironclad.\n\nA future, more Europe-led NATO would likely be focused more on the alliance’s original purpose of deterring Russian aggression on the continent, rather than the overseas deployments in places like Afghanistan and Libya.\n\nFor some European policymakers, there is a silver lining to Trump’s attitude Though they may not appreciate the crudeness of his approach, many concede he has a point that Europe should take greater responsibility for its own defense and make more of the decisions about its own defense priorities, rather than letting Washington set them.\n\nBut that’s going to require a new way of thinking.\n\n“What will we do for leadership?” asked Nick Witney, a British former diplomat and EU official, now with the European Council on Foreign Relations. “For 80 years, that’s always been easily solved. We go and ask the Americans, and whatever they say, that’s what we should do.”\n\nThe past 80 years may have been an era in which Europe felt uncomfortably dependent on the US for security, but it’s also been a period of unprecedented peace on the continent. A future with less American presence in the alliance will require new ways of thinking and risk old sources of trust reemerging. Some policymakers have raised concerns about the rest of Europe relying on French nuclear weapons as a deterrent, given the real possibility France too could be governed by Russia-friendly right-wing populists in a few years",

        "content": "For a chance at a youthful complexion, you could slap rendered cow fat on your face, rub snail slime into your wrinkles, or get a salmon sperm facial right after a microneedling treatment.\n\nYou read that right: These are things actual people are doing. Influencers, celebrities, and everyday consumers alike are touting the youthful glow such animal-derived products bring to their complexion.\n\nFor some consumers, opting for a product like beef tallow is an intentional decision to move away from the conventional skincare products typically sold at the drug store or Sephora. It’s understandable — every day, it seems, we’re told of new horror about how forever chemicals and microplastics are embedded into our environment and bodies. From food to skincare, US consumers have shown they want to distance themselves from potentially unhealthy or toxic ingredients. They’re looking for products that market themselves as clean, concerned that the ingredients in typical treatments are worsening issues like acne or are harmful for long-term health. Beef tallow is a type of MAHA-ism for beauty (and for food, too).\n\nOne surprising thing I’ve struggled with bad eczema flare-ups my whole life, so I know what it’s like to be frustrated with endlessly dry and patchy skin. But according to Sentient, the benefits of beef tallow as a skincare product are “largely unremarkable.” And while some may see relief for their skin ailments, it could also worsen their issues. Just like any product for the skin, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThe cosmetics industry sold over $400 billion worth of products in 2023, with skincare making up the sector’s largest category. It’s easy to get sucked into the rabbit hole that is becoming beautiful, especially in a world that is all about maximizing self-improvement. Skincare, in particular, is a personal issue for me — I’ve had eczema my whole life, and when I’m having a particularly bad flare-up, I feel insecure and desperate for a cure. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to feel good about yourself.\n\nBut there is an ethical problem if feeling good about yourself comes at the expense of animals — and that’s increasingly the case with these new clean beauty trends.\n\nThe cosmetics sector has long — and, at times, quietly — depended on animals, much like the agriculture and fashion industries. Way before folks were spending $44 on beef tallow whipped with chamomile, everyday products like hair-strengthening shampoos featured keratin (usually derived from animal fur or hooves), lipstick pigments depended on carmine (ground-up bugs), and anti-aging moisturizers incorporated collagen (a structural protein found in animal hides and fish skin). That’s not including animal testing to ensure the safety of ingredients in cosmetics.\n\nWhile some consumers are intentionally seeking out animal-derived products and treatments, plenty of consumers aren’t necessarily concerned about what’s in their cosmetics, or are perhaps unaware of how a certain science-y sounding ingredient is sourced. Instead, they orient more toward what’s trendy or seemingly effective.\n\nWhatever the reason may be for using animal-based skincare and beauty products, we’re still ignoring a larger problem. Just because something comes from an animal, it doesn’t mean the process of getting into our hands is “clean” or “natural.” And even if some of these animal-derived products have beneficial properties for our skin, it still comes at a cost bigger than we realize.\n\nIn reality, many of these beauty trends that claim to be against the “toxic” nature of mainstream wellness or those touting the benefits of animal-based products are upholding the very industries that are harming our planet. And in turn, it’s harming ourselves — a steep cost for beauty.\n\n“Clean” living, dirty consequences\n\nWhen I saw beef tallow hawked on social media, one question immediately came to mind: How were these businesses sourcing their animal ingredients?\n\nThat led me to look up “beef tallow for skin” on Amazon, where there were pages upon pages of results. They all used similar language to describe their product: “ancestral,” “natural,” “organic.” Most of the sellers advertised themselves as small businesses and included images of cows on their product packaging, to further hammer home that what you’re purchasing differs from big, mainstream beauty.\n\nBeef tallow for skin is made by taking the fat of a cow and rendering it until it’s ready to be whipped into a cream-like moisturizer. So where are these cows to begin with? Of the nine products I looked at with 300 reviews or more on Amazon, only one named a small farm in Virginia as a supplier. The others simply listed that their tallow came from “grass-fed” cows.\n\nWhile the term “grass-fed” may suggest to some consumers the pinnacle of animal welfare and sustainability, the reality is far more complicated. For starters, virtually all cows spend most of their lives on pasture eating grass; it’s only until their final months that they’re moved into feedlots, which are pastureless, outdoor dirt pens — in essence, factory farms for cattle. (Per USDA guidelines, “grass-fed” cows are never supposed to enter feedlots and remain on pasture during their final months, though the agency doesn’t go on to ranches to verify them and there’s a long history of meat companies misleading the public on these types of claims.)\n\nFeedlots are worse for animal welfare, but “grass-fed” beef has its own sustainability problems, so there are tradeoffs between the two systems. But ultimately, sustainability and animal welfare claims on animal products are poorly regulated, and it’s even harder to trace/verify these claims once they wind up on a skincare product.\n\nThis cattle ranch in Coalinga, CA is one of the largest feedlots in the United States. Vince Penn / We Animals\n\n“Terms like sustainability, farm-raised, so forth, are pretty broad,” said Glynn Tonsor, an agricultural economist and assistant professor at Kansas State University. “There’s not an internationally accepted standard that you got to cross-check on.” So language like “grass-fed” doesn’t help determine the source of the beef or how high-quality it is — but businesses use them anyway in marketing their products because they’re aware these terms appeal to consumers and elicit a sense of naturalness and quality.\n\nOne of the beef tallow moisturizers on Amazon with over 700 reviews had no website to find any other information — just an Amazon storefront with other beef tallow beauty products. It also advertised its beef tallow as “organic,” a claim that should make you raise your eyebrow because the US Department of Agriculture does have regulations for food products labeled as organic. While the USDA doesn’t oversee cosmetics, beauty products with agricultural ingredients can be organic-certified by the USDA if they meet the standards.\n\n“There’s hardly any organic beef production,” says Richard Sexton, a University of California Davis agricultural economist, when I asked him about beef by-product sourcing. “I don’t really know how they can say that the by-products are organic.”\n\nTonsor added another way to think about vague claims on products: “If somebody tries to sell you gluten-free water, don’t pay a premium for it.”\n\nAnd while “grass-fed” can give off the vibe of a more green, natural, or sustainable process, it’s actually worse for the climate, says Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor of environmental studies at New York University. “Grass-fed trades off not eating corn and soy for living longer, requiring more land, and producing more greenhouse gasses,” the 2024 Future Perfect 50 honoree told me. Over a third of methane emissions from human activity comes from our agricultural practices, with cattle being the main driver. (Cattle burps are rich in methane).\n\nWhen animal waste breaks down, it forms pollutants like ammonia gas. Ammonia emits a deeply unpleasant smell, and exposure can lead to symptoms like headaches, irritated eyes, skin, and lungs. One study found that there are 12,700 premature deaths annually attributed to increased fine particulate matter pollution (largely driven by ammonia) from the production of animal-based food. And 4,000 of those deaths are specifically attributed to beef cattle. Communities near factory farms have also reported animal waste polluting their waterways with nitrates.\n\nSo while “grass-fed” beef tallow for skin has been popularized by content creators on platforms like TikTok for it being “natural” and “clean” because it’s animal-derived, it’s likely that it’s helping bolster an industry that’s polluting local communities and our planet.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

A 2023 collaborative investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, The Guardian, Center for Climate Crime Analysis, ITV, and O Joio e O Trigo found that collagen operations in Brazil drove the deforestation of at least 1,000 sq. mi of tropical forest as well as violence against Indigenous peoples occupying that land. Brazil is the world’s largest exporter of beef, and as demand for collagen booms, more land will be needed to raise cattle. The cattle industry has driven 80 percent of Amazon forest loss in Brazil, according to the investigation.\n\nEven calling beef tallow or collagen “by-products” undermines how useful they can be as profit-makers to the meat industry, even if they generate far less money than the parts we eat. “If something fetches a price, then it’s not a by-product,” Hayek said. “It’s another revenue generating production stream. It’s a co-product.”\n\nThe strangeness of snail slime and salmon sperm\n\nSourcing for even more niche animal-based products, like snail mucin and salmon sperm skincare treatments, is not as easy to track as beef. Both were popularized in South Korea, a leader in the cosmetics and skincare industry.\n\nSnail mucin has made a recent comeback in the US with popular products like COSRX’s snail essence formula, which has nearly 4,000 reviews on Ulta, a cosmetics chain. An article from Racked reported that the process for sourcing and extracting snail mucin is intentionally mysterious because beauty companies don’t want their competition to know the technology they use.\n\nA 2022 Business Insider video showed just that, however, uncovering how one snail production hub in Italy extracted their mucin. After receiving the snails from local snail farms, the small creatures were placed inside machines where they were sprayed with an acidic solution that caused the snails to excrete their slime. The institution said it was a cruelty-free process, but after repeating this process a few times, the snails were euthanized and were used for cooking and other cosmetic products.\n\nSalmon sperm facials are much newer to the scene than snail mucin. In South Korea, the process involves injecting polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN), which are fragments of DNA from salmon sperm, all over the face. In the US, salmon DNA injections have not been approved by the FDA, so cosmetic spas often apply PDRN topically after microneedling in order for the product to be absorbed.\n\nJennifer Aniston, who has received a salmon sperm facial, had the same question as I did when I first heard about these treatments: “How do you get salmon’s sperm?” she asked the Wall Street Journal in 2023. I called up eight cosmetic spas to ask where they sourced their salmon DNA, and scoured several others’ websites for any details. While there appears to be at least a few PDRN products being used by professionals, the one that came up the most was Rejuran. Their website for cosmetic spas says they source PDRN from wild salmon in Korea, and their retail US website says they seek ways to reduce their environmental impact across their operations.\n\nI emailed Rejuran for more details about where the salmon comes from for their PDRN-based products, as well as if their environmental efforts extend to how they source their salmon. They have not yet responded.\n\nThe individualism of “clean” beauty\n\nIf you take an extra minute or two to think about it, the strangeness of using animals for something as superficial as perfect skin starts to set in. Couple that with obscure sourcing practices, harmful environmental impacts, and questionable animal welfare practices, and the cost of it all starts to add up.\n\nBut when you feel the pressure to look a certain way, it’s easy to gloss over how the sausage — or in some cases, serum — gets made.\n\nThe desire to have a healthy body, to have access to healthy food and water, and for our environment to be free from harmful toxins is a right we all deserve. This newest iteration of skincare trends advertised as clean, natural, and animal-derived, however, ultimately does nothing to make that goal a reality.\n\nWant to let go of animal products in your skincare routine? Here’s how to start: This list by Shop Like You Give a Damn lays out common beauty and skincare ingredients that are always, often, or sometimes animal-derived. Next time you’re shopping for a new moisturizer or serum, you can use the list to cross-reference and determine which products are free of animal-based ingredients.\n\nThere’s no official definition of clean beauty, but the general idea refers to skincare and cosmetics that exclude ingredients that could be harmful to our bodies, like parabens. Much of this parallels the rise of returning to “clean living” and “ancestral diets.” People are cutting out dyes, preservatives, and ultra-processed foods in favor of eating high protein, animal-based diets and using only “non-toxic” products. It’s a lifestyle that’s been around for a while but it’s making a strong comeback in tandem with the Make American Healthy Again movement.\n\nAs it tends to be with wellness and beauty, this revitalized uptick in animal-based beauty is deeply individualistic. Here’s how you can look younger longer, here’s how you can be more beautiful, here’s how you can remove toxins from your body. The prioritization of personal validation over communal health encourages people to trust surface-level statements about what’s “clean” and what’s not at face value.\n\nIt’s true that nearly everything humans do is extractive one way or another, but that’s not a reason to avoid acknowledging our participation in that cost. If people want to get real about healthier communities and a cleaner world, it can’t be done alone by individually buying your way toward there. It’s much harder and more complicated than that, and I know that the average person doesn’t have the resources to seriously address these issues.\n\nStronger regulations for both the food and beauty industry could take the responsibility off of consumers and instead put it on companies. In 2022, the US passed the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act, which intended to do this very thing by giving the Food and Drug Administration regulatory power over cosmetics. But according to Allure, advocates feared that implementation would be delayed after Donald Trump won the 2024 election due to potential FDA cuts. Just last month, hundreds of employees at federal health agencies, including the FDA, were fired.\n\nIn the meantime, maybe a small step in the right direction is to look away from our reflection in the mirror, pay more attention to what we’re consuming, and to dig a little deeper if the cost — supporting industries that are contributing to local air and water pollution, climate change, and questionable animal welfare practices — is worth the price.",

        "content": "Shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump took a set of thick, black permanent markers and signed a sweeping set of executive orders that took aim at everything from immigration and gender to TikTok and climate change. One of his first moves was to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations’ global health agency responsible for safeguarding and promoting health around the world since 1948.\n\nThe US is one of the WHO’s biggest funders, so any shortage of financial and political support will likely have major ramifications for global health efforts like eliminating malaria, improving access to high-quality health care, and reducing maternal mortality. While that may not directly matter to rich countries like the US that have the means to address their own health challenges, one of the WHO’s most important jobs is to help coordinate the international response to pandemics and outbreaks — events that can threaten everyone, regardless of borders, as we learned during Covid-19.\n\nTo Trump and his supporters, the WHO’s perceived failure on that job is one of the biggest reasons why the US should withdraw. Chief among Trump’s complaints are the WHO’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global health crises, its failure to reform, and its inability to demonstrate independence from powerful but authoritarian WHO member states, namely China.\n\nTrump’s decision has engendered plenty of criticism, including from experts who argue that the US could suffer if it loses access to vital WHO data on outbreaks. Still, the WHO is far from perfect, and even before Trump, scientists, think tanks, and government bodies have been pointing out the WHO’s myriad problems, from the lack of term limits for senior leadership to its massive budget for headquarters staff who are paid additional stipends (around $5,000 to $7,000 per month) to cover the cost of living in Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities.\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI’ve seen the inefficiencies and mismanagement first hand: In my almost 10-year career as a global health epidemiologist, I have interacted with the WHO on many occasions, including, at times, coordinating with them to respond to disease outbreaks in Africa. Like Trump, my biggest complaint is that the organization has shown it is loath to reflect on and address its deficiencies — deficiencies that matter hugely when it has been given the monumental responsibility of safeguarding the world’s health. There has always been some intangible and unspoken sense that the WHO cannot be wrong and cannot be questioned, even after it was clear that it bungled certain aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut while the WHO is far from perfect, many of its flaws are symptoms of more fundamental challenges that go beyond how it is governed. Balancing the need to respond to international health threats while respecting national sovereignty means cooperation is a fine line — and it’s one that’s becoming harder for the agency to walk.\n\nFor the WHO to survive, it needs to improve. And for the US to have the best chances of protecting itself from future global health emergencies — especially as the Trump administration also works to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, another key player in global health and development — it still needs the WHO. But it needs a better one.\n\nWhat Trump gets right — and wrong — about WHO\n\nIn his executive order, Trump reiterated many of the same issues he raised five years ago when he first threatened to withdraw from the WHO.\n\nOne of Trump’s biggest complaints was that the agency was too slow to alert the world of an emerging health threat in China and to move to contain its spread. Local newspapers had been reporting that a mysterious illness was spreading around Wuhan as early as November 17, 2019, a fact backed up by genetic analysis.\n\nBut Chinese health authorities didn’t alert the WHO — which the country was required to do under a legal framework called the International Health Regulations — to a spate of patients with an unknown pneumonia-like disease until December 31. By then, valuable time to contain the disease had been lost, though it is Beijing, not WHO, that is largely at fault for this lag.\n\nStill, while the WHO has limited if any power to compel China or any other country to act, the body should have been more proactive in November and December.\n\n“WHO has country offices, WHO has relationships with Ministries of Health. I would argue they certainly should have been aware this was happening,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health and the White House Covid-19 response coordinator during the Biden administration. “It was showing up in a lot of media, social media, and they should have pushed the government to say, what is this? What is going on here, and why don’t we know more about it?”\n\nWithin five days of learning about the unusual cases in China, the WHO had alerted its member states. But the WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to China and, instead of confronting the government about its obfuscation, heralded Beijing’s response to the outbreak. And then the WHO consistently parrotted inaccurate information from the Chinese government — namely that the virus was not spreading from person to person — to the rest of the world for weeks.\n\nWhile the WHO proclaimed Covid-19 a public health emergency in late January, the messaging from the highest levels of WHO in those early months, when officials believed it was still possible that Covid could be contained, was too often confusing.\n\n“For the moment, we are not witnessing sustained and intensive community transmission of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” Ghebreyesus said during a briefing in late February. That was simply untrue. By that time, China had reported almost 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, while 37 other countries were also reporting cases and deaths.\n\nIt also took the WHO two years, until late 2021, to finally acknowledge that Covid-19 was airborne, despite the mountain of evidence that scientists had amassed just six months after the first cases. A WHO spokesperson pushed back against this. “From January 2020, WHO said transmission was occurring between people when they breathe, talk (later sing) and especially in settings like hospitals, households and long term living facilities,” a spokesperson told Vox by email. While some of this confusion stemmed from longstanding disagreement on what exactly constitutes airborne spread, as late as March 2020 the WHO was still confidently tweeting, “FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,” even as people were being infected through the air.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a daily press briefing on Covid-19 on March 11, 2020. Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump has also repeatedly criticized the WHO for not fully investigating the theory that the Covid-19 virus originated from virological work in a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than the conventional explanation that it began in wild animals sold at a meat market. The WHO sent a team of investigators to China in 2021, but Chinese scientists refused to discuss the so-called “lab leak” theory and then pressured investigators to dismiss the possibility altogether, according to the lead scientist on the team.\n\nAgain, though, the WHO has no authority to compel member states to turn over data or to cooperate on investigations. In fact, the WHO cannot even work inside a member state without that country’s permission. This is certainly a limitation of the WHO, but that’s because it answers to its member states — it is not some sort of supra-national health policy enforcement body.\n\nBeyond Covid, Trump has also griped that the WHO requires the US to make “unfairly onerous” payments, because US dues exceed the payment the organization demands of China, which has about four times the number of people as in the US.\n\nThe WHO is funded in two ways. The first is through assessed contributions, essentially membership dues, that each WHO member state is required to pay each year. The United Nations has a process for determining how much each country owes, but it’s essentially based on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP), not its population size.\n\nUS GDP in 2023 was about 1.5 times higher than China’s. That year, the US was required to pay the WHO $218 million, about two times more than China was assessed. So while the US does pay more than China, that difference is almost, though not quite, proportional to GDP.\n\nAssessed contributions, however, make up less than 20 percent of the WHO’s total funds. Its other funding comes from voluntary contributions from member states and non-governmental donors, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHere is where the US and China make vastly different contributions to the WHO. In 2023, China gave the organization about $40 million in voluntary contributions plus an additional $935,000 toward an emergency fund on top of its assessed contribution, while the US government donated more than $1 billion in voluntary funds and about $47 million toward the emergency fund. In all, that meant the US gave the WHO about $1.27 billion in 2023, about 18 percent of their total budget, while China gave about $156 million when you tally up all contributions. So while the US does give vastly more to the WHO than China, most of that is in voluntary donations.\n\nOf course, the US doesn’t have to pull out of the WHO altogether to rectify this situation — it could simply choose to donate less to the WHO, or mandate that its contributions come with reform. And the institution does need reform.\n\nWho’s at fault at WHO, explained\n\nCovid wasn’t the first time the WHO came under international fire. Take the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nThe organization was criticized back in 2014 for its long delay in declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, which hindered swift containment measures that could have prevented the virus from spreading across borders. From the start, the WHO fundamentally underestimated the severity of the outbreak — Ebola would go on to kill more than 11,000 people primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with scattered cases reported in the US and several European countries, too. It ultimately took the WHO and its partners two years to get the Ebola outbreak under control.\n\nDespite the number of deaths, Ebola’s spread was limited largely because it isn’t a respiratory disease like Covid-19; rather it spreads through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily fluids. But that fact makes the failure to contain Ebola all the more glaring.\n\nTo be fair, all outbreak and pandemic responses are chaotic, especially when an entirely novel virus like Covid starts spreading. New information is constantly emerging, and a lot of different individuals and institutions have to come together to coordinate the flow of information and the rollout of interventions or recommendations, even as the full picture of the outbreak is inevitably unclear. Outbreaks often happen in far-flung areas that lack health care workers, hospitals, laboratories, and even roads and internet. Cultural practices, economic conditions, and a preexisting lack of trust in politicians and health officials further complicate responses.\n\nA health worker waits to handle a new unconfirmed Ebola patient at a newly built Doctors Without Borders-supported Ebola treatment center on November 7, 2018, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. John Wessels/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for delaying the dissemination of vaccines to help curb an ongoing mpox outbreak which began in May 2022 and spread to more than 120 countries before the virus became largely confined to central and eastern Africa.\n\nIn mid-2022, the US and EU approved an mpox vaccine made by the Danish pharmaceutical company Bavarian Nordic. But the WHO, which has its own process for reviewing and approving drugs and vaccines, did not approve the vaccine until September 2024.\n\nThat delay mattered. For one, other organizations like UNICEF and Gavi that play a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines in developing countries require WHO approval before they can move forward with vaccination campaigns. Many developing countries do not have or have only pared-down versions of drug regulatory agencies so they also rely on the WHO to approve medicines before they roll them out in their countries, explained Rogério Gaspar, the director of WHO’s Department of Regulation and Prequalification. And so when it came to the mpox vaccine, many countries — especially in Africa, where the outbreak was most severe — were waiting for the green light from WHO before they could roll out the needed vaccines, even though the US and Europe had already approved them.\n\nThe WHO blames the long delay on Bavarian Nordic. The WHO claimed that the company did not submit the mpox vaccine for review until August 2024, some two years after the mpox outbreak had begun, and that once it did, the WHO approved it within two weeks, according to a WHO spokesperson.\n\nBut Bavarian Nordic refutes this timeline. A spokesperson told Vox that the pharmaceutical company first met with WHO in August 2022 and submitted a dossier on the vaccine in May 2023. The dossier they submitted to the WHO contained the same information that led to the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the FDA, approving the vaccine for use in Europe. It isn’t clear why the WHO didn’t act sooner. Back in August 2024, the WHO director of health product policy and standards, Deusdedit Mubangizi, told reporters that there wasn’t enough data to support its approval. But now, it seems, the WHO has changed its story, ducking accountability once again.\n\nThe entire process has frustrated some public health experts. “It’s almost like WHO saying, hey, we’re not responsible for our own process,” Jha said. “This is the lack of accountability. It’s everybody else’s fault.”\n\n(A WHO spokesperson pointed out that member states did not have to wait until the WHO’s review was complete to buy and distribute the vaccines.)\n\nOver the years, the WHO has tried to address its critics through a laundry list of reform efforts — and there has been some improvement. Between 2020 and 2022, smaller Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Guinea have been contained in just a few months. That’s a hopeful signal the organization has potentially improved not only its own ability to quickly respond to outbreaks, but has also helped build member states’ capacity to detect and contain health emergencies. It also helps that since 2014, scientists have also developed a number of vaccines and treatments that would certainly help quell an outbreak.\n\nStill, while there were improvements in the Ebola response that can be attributable to the WHO, the organization’s dismal performance during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that these reforms remain insufficient. And the bigger issue is that the WHO simply cannot admit its mistakes. The organization has still not come out and listed the errors it made during the Covid-19 pandemic. Though the WHO convened an independent panel of experts to review the international response to Covid-19, the panel’s reports largely focus on the failures of WHO member states and say little about the WHO’s own shortcomings.\n\n“There is very little interest at WHO in introspection,” Jha said. “There’s very little interest in WHO in figuring out how to do better.”\n\nAnd given how enormous — and how difficult — the WHO’s responsibilities are, that introspection is needed.\n\nThe WHO’s impossible task\n\nThe WHO’s mission is to foster global public health, but what that means in practice depends on what counts as global. As it stands, its 194 member states (193 without the US) have tasked the organization with outbreak prevention and response and other responsibilities that impact nearly all countries. That includes setting international health standards and collecting data on an ever-increasing list of health priorities ranging from maternal and child health and nutrition to sanitation and clean water. But some of the WHO’s work focuses on supplementing national health programs and filling gaps that benefit individual nations — specifically those with the least resources — rather than the world as a whole.\n\nThose responsibilities fit poorly with a Trump administration that is bringing an America First approach to health — and other countries are taking notice. Argentina has announced that it also plans to withdraw from the WHO, while Italian politicians have introduced legislation that would do the same. Other European countries have slashed global health aid budgets in recent years.\n\nThat the US cannot remain a WHO member while also consciously putting itself first highlights a friction in the field. Is global health about containing dangerous outbreaks so they don’t breach your own border and pose a threat to national security? Or is global health about saving lives and improving the health of everyone, regardless of their nationality? Can competing nation-states like China and the US set aside their political warfare and come together on one issue — health — or has the time for international cooperation finally ended?\n\nOne way to address that contradiction would be for the WHO to scale back on the number of health areas it is involved in and focus primarily on issues that actually transcend borders. This would include infectious diseases — but only those that present a truly global threat.\n\nThe WHO itself puts together a list of pathogens with the potential to cause a pandemic. It includes familiar diseases such as West Nile, Zika, Ebola, and Covid-19. Many of these have already caused deadly outbreaks and pandemics. Something else that transcends borders: products such as cigarettes or baby formula. The WHO might also have a role to play in regulating the safety of these products, according to Jesse Bump, a public health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThis recommendation is not to say that newborn and maternal health or access to clean water are not important, life-saving services that everyone on Earth should have. But these represent more national health priorities for the countries dealing with these issues and not truly global threats.\n\nWithout some form of additional support, paring down the WHO’s focus areas would have fatal consequences for some places. Particularly in low-income countries, the WHO serves as a lifeline of essential health services and often fills many of the responsibilities that national health agencies in wealthy nations like the US handle, a WHO spokesperson explained.\n\nOf course, the fact that the WHO is tasked with addressing so many different areas of health fundamentally reflects both the massive health disparities around the world and the way the organization is funded. Consider the health challenges that a country like the US faces compared to many developing countries. In places like Niger, Papua New Guinea, Chad, and the DRC, more than half of the population does not have access to clean drinking water or basic water services. More than 50 percent of people in Somalia and Haiti are malnourished. In southern Africa, HIV is still a leading cause of death; in parts of West Africa, malaria is a leading cause of death.\n\nIn much of the global north, by contrast, these health challenges are virtually nonexistent, and where they are present, it’s because of national priorities, not a lack of national resources.\n\nConsider as well the drastic difference in the health workforce around the world. In many low- and middle-income counties, there are major shortages of doctors and nurses, not to mention specialists such as neurologists or surgeons. In more than 50 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, there are fewer than one doctor per 1,000 people in the entire country. The US has almost four times as many doctors per capita.\n\nWhat this means is that the state of health and health care is so grossly unequal across countries that one organization cannot possibly address them all while also ensuring that every member states benefits equally from their WHO membership.\n\nAnd the benefits are unequal, at least in strict financial terms. Last year, countries in Africa and the WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region — which includes parts of North Africa and the Middle East including some very poor and conflict-afflicted member states such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and Sudan — received $2.9 billion, almost half of the WHO’s $6.8 billion budget. The region of the Americas, which includes the US, received the least amount of funding, just over $300 million. But even here, it’s important to understand that the inequality in who gives and who gets from the WHO is largely a function of the fact that some regions and countries simply have a massively greater need for international aid.\n\nIt’s important to remember that the WHO has limited control over its own agenda. It is member states themselves who vote on the organization’s scope of work and approve its budget. Beyond the required payments, countries and other donors can earmark their voluntary funds for specific causes. The US, for instance, earmarks more than half of its funds for epidemic prevention or response and polio eradication while Nordic countries typically focus their funding on maternal health.\n\nThis approach to funding helps the WHO account for individual member state priorities but also allows countries to use funds to influence the WHO’s scope of work. Ultimately, it means that the WHO has little choice but to expand and scatter its workforce to make sure every country’s pet projects get completed.\n\nIs there any room for WHO in America First?\n\nShort of remaking the WHO into an institution under the leadership of the US government, it’s difficult to imagine that any amount of reform will satisfy the current administration. The organization’s mission is completely misaligned with Trump’s “America First” agenda. In the WHO, as in most other UN international bodies, America does not come first. It has the same vote as every other member state, even though the US contributes more money than any other country.\n\nBut despite its many shortcomings, the US needs the WHO. Only an international health agency such as the WHO can overcome the nuanced complexities of economic competition, geopolitics, and even outright war, to respond to global health emergencies. The WHO serves as a bridge for sharing information and even biological samples of pathogens, which is critical for understanding how a disease will spread and for developing medicines and vaccines.\n\nTrump’s vision of global health or public health, for that matter, is unclear. Just as unclear is whether Trump’s executive order on the WHO is even legal. Members of Congress have asked Trump to reconsider. Though the full impact of the US withdrawal will probably not be felt for about a year, the WHO’s director-general has already ordered a hiring freeze, mandated that some contracts be renegotiated, and directed staff in country offices to provide only essential support.\n\nAs the WHO adapts to a future without US investment, the Trump administration is also gutting other key global health efforts. This month, thousands of USAID staff were laid off, leaving only about 300 employees of a once 10,000-person workforce. It isn’t yet clear what global health areas the drastically smaller agency will work on — or whether it will exist at all — and it wouldn’t be surprising if the administration goes after other global health initiatives like the ones led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmerican retreat from both the WHO and its own broader global health efforts paradoxically makes the case for WHO reform all the more important. Many complaints about how the WHO does its work are valid, especially given its reluctance to confront mistakes. But much of what it is criticized for is built into the way the institution itself operates or reflects a world with hugely varying health problems and national abilities to meet them. Still, the WHO must do better because it is the only organization uniquely placed to bridge diplomatic tensions and address international health threats. The most hopeful read on Trump’s action will shock the bureaucracy into action, and lead the Trump administration to ultimately realize that an American-first approach must include the WHO.",

        "content": "is a Future Perfect fellow covering global public health, science, and environment. Previously, she worked as an infectious diseases epidemiologist and global health security adviser supporting various US government agencies, multilateral organizations, and private research institutes.\n\nIn about three short months, the Trump administration took a wrecking ball to foreign aid, threatening millions of lives and livelihoods around the world. After initially pausing all US foreign aid spending for 90 days, President Donald Trump handed over the reins to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe damage as DOGE went about clear-cutting the US Agency for International Development (USAID) was swift and extensive. Health clinics from Afghanistan to Burundi shuttered. Oxygen tanks, HIV and malaria medications, and other medical supplies amounting to at least $240 million remain stuck at ports or storage facilities around the world. Ebola prevention and response funding, which Musk claimed at the end of February was restored with “no interruption” during the 90-day freeze, is reportedly still not operational, according to several public health experts. Whether it’s aid for malnutrition, clean water, or outbreak response, even a handful of days can undo years of progress in the making.\n\nThe administration has not yet published a full list of all affected programs and projects. But former USAID workers and contractors are counting up canceled projects based on termination notices received by project staff. So far, many foundational global health efforts to treat malnutrition, prevent newborn and maternal mortality, or eliminate infectious diseases such as HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, and polio have been impacted. Projects that aimed to improve infectious disease surveillance in foreign countries and to help prevent and contain future pandemics — which could directly impact American health and security — were also cut.\n\nThe consequences that have been documented so far are severe and widesweeping, and yet they represent an incomplete tally of how billions of lives and livelihoods will be affected now or in the future. Here is everything we know about the US foreign aid’s global health effects around the world in three charts.\n\nMillions of patients stranded\n\nUntil very recently, USAID worked in 160 countries to spread democracy, reduce poverty, improve health, prevent and contain infectious disease outbreaks and provide food, clean water, and education to rural, underserved, refugee, and conflict-affected communities. In the decades since President John F. Kennedy established the agency in 1961, USAID became a household name in many countries. US foreign aid in those decades was a critical and oft-studied tool of global diplomacy, and one that — until recently — has had consistent bipartisan support.\n\nWhen it comes to aid, the US is irreplaceable. US donations to the United Nations in 2024 comprised 40 percent of all funds for humanitarian aid. The US donated almost half of all global food aid and made huge contributions to the World Health Organization for disease outbreaks and health emergencies.\n\nIn all, the US spent more than $10 billion on health aid around the world in 2024. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa received the lion’s share of that aid, but developing countries everywhere have been affected by US funding cuts. Here are some key impacts that the US foreign funding freeze has had so far:\n\nAn estimated 3.8 million women lost access to contraception globally.\n\n9 million people in Afghanistan — nearly a quarter of the population — will no longer receive US-funded healthcare services .\n\nNearly 700,000 people in Burkina Faso and Mali have lost access to water, food, or health services.\n\nThe World Food Programme, for which the US is the largest single donor , has shut down its operations in South Africa, where 27 million people are at risk of hunger as the country faces its worst drought in decades.\n\nIn Nigeria, 25,000 extremely malnourished children will no longer be receiving food assistance by April.\n\nPerhaps the most important program targeted is the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR, which provides testing services and treatment to prevent and treat HIV, is credited with saving some 25 million lives. Although the program was not entirely cancelled, several major contracts were cut or shrunk down considerably. As a result, 20.6 million people, including almost 600,000 children, are no longer receiving HIV treatment that was previously funded by the US. Experts estimate that HIV burden could increase sixfold in the next four years.\n\nThe Trump administration’s dismantling of USAID and other government agencies has been messy. There have been a flurry of lawsuits still awaiting court decisions that allege the Trump administration’s actions against USAID and its contractors are unlawful; however, on Monday, a federal judge declined to order the administration to restore canceled contracts.\n\nChina is already moving into the void. Local media outlets from Nepal to Colombia have reported that representatives of the Chinese government have already come forward with offers to expand its assistance in areas from agriculture and disaster relief to health care and poverty alleviation. After floods devastated parts of Madagascar, Chinese officials mounted their first-ever humanitarian response in the country. Within days, Chinese aid tents lined the Ikopa River.\n\nHow much China will aim to capitalize on this opportunity is not yet clear. And while the US foreign aid freeze and cuts have already had enormous repercussions, its full effects won’t be felt in full for months or even years to come. USAID-funded agriculture programs, for instance, were not able to disperse seeds in time for planting, which means that farmers may miss an entire growing season, a spokesperson for a US nonprofit company that receives USAID contracts told me. This will worsen food insecurity and could plunge families into poverty.\n\nIn other places, time-sensitive mosquito control activities — like spraying insecticide to kill larva before they become mosquitos — were missed, which will likely result in an explosion of dengue, malaria, and other mosquito-borne infectious diseases in a few months.\n\nA lack of US funding for polio eradication efforts will likely lead to an additional 200,000 polio cases a year. Some 10.6 million cases of tuberculosis and 2.2 million deaths will not be prevented in the void of US foreign aid funding.\n\nIf you’re an optimist, then you might hold on to a bit of hope that some of these programs might be restored, that the bipartisan consensus that once supported foreign aid can be rebuilt. But as the days go by, that seems increasingly unlikely. The hard reality is that the Trump administration’s actions have left massive gaps in global aid that will ultimately be measured in lives lost.",

        "content": "When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market? There’s no simple answer, but there’s a rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run.\n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7 percent, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7 percent, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being that you’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time.\n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10 percent annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\n\n\nFind this and other Vox videos on YouTube.\n\n\n\nThis video is presented by Robinhood.

        "source": "https://www.vox.com/",
        "content": "is a staff writer for The Atlantic and the author of Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change .\n\nIf I ever need a reminder that I’m not a natural extrovert, I need only to look at the journal I kept during the early days of my improv classes. “I am having incredible dread about improv tomorrow,” I wrote one day. “I would literally pay any amount to get out of this class,” I moaned on another. “You can’t be bad at improv, but I feel like I am bad at improv,” I wrote after a class during which I gave up in the middle of a game called Big Booty and said simply, “I can’t take this anymore.”\n\nI had enrolled in improv because I was trying to become more extroverted, as part of a sweeping personality-change project that I document in my new book, Me, But Better. Extroversion is one of the “big five” personality traits that scientists say make up a person’s disposition, along with openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Extroversion is associated with socializing and cheerfulness, and as a hardened introvert, I knew I needed a mechanism to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. Improv seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.\n\nThese perks of extroversion would only reveal themselves to me in time, after many, many hours of playing Zip Zap Zop against my will.\n\nBut it wasn’t going well, and at times, I thought about dropping the class or giving up altogether. Even after I got better at improv, I still felt nervous before every class. And the other activities I was doing to boost my extroversion — like going on long hikes with strangers — were only mildly pleasant, at best. I had this notion that, since I was an introvert, I should avoid difficult social situations like, well, improv class.\n\nI’m glad I didn’t give up, though. It turns out that behaving in an extroverted way can have surprising benefits, even if you’re an introvert. And these perks of extroversion would only reveal themselves to me in time, after many, many hours of playing Zip Zap Zop against my will.\n\nWhat spurts of extroversion can do for introverts\n\nCompared to introverts, extroverts are happier, research unfortunately shows. An exhaustingly chirpy series of studies has found that social connection is one of the strongest predictors of well-being, and extroverts are more socially connected. In lab experiments, extroverts tend to interpret ambiguous stimuli more positively, hearing the word “won” rather than “one,” for example, or writing more uplifting short stories based on generic prompts. People who are extroverted as teenagers remain happier even when they’re 60.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nI understand that introverts might not be thrilled to hear this — I wasn’t, either. But Sonja Lyubomirsky, a psychologist who has studied this phenomenon, says it’s worth focusing less on the “extrovert” part of this and more on the fact that these individuals are more enmeshed in community. “Connection is really the key to happiness,” Lyubomirsky told me. And there are ways to square your natural introversion with the universal human need for connection. You don’t have to mingle with everyone at the office party, for instance. You can just call a trusted friend for a one-on-one conversation. Even hanging out with others and listening more than you talk can be a form of “extroversion,” Lyubomirsky says.\n\nOne surprising thing Introverts may believe that behaving like extroverts means going against their nature — but this doesn’t bother us as much as we might think. In one study, introverts even reported feeling truer to themselves when they were behaving like extroverts.\n\nWhile it’s true that extroverts enjoy talking, people, and attention, they also enjoy activity, period. Therefore, to boost your own levels of extroversion, you can just sign up for an activity — in addition to improv, I tried sailing — and commit to going, even if you don’t plan to talk much.\n\nThough there’s nothing wrong with being an introvert, several studies have shown that when introverts occasionally behave in extroverted ways, they experience more “positive affect” — science-speak for good feelings. “I started doing these studies because I didn’t believe them,” says John Zelenski, a psychology professor at Carleton University who has replicated this finding, and who himself is introverted. But “it absolutely seems correct that if you get people to act extroverted — and usually, that means socializing for a few minutes — there’s a big mood boost there.”\n\nThe reason for this twist is that behaving against our natures doesn’t bother us as much as we fear it might. In one study, introverts even reported feeling truer to themselves when they were behaving like extroverts. That’s because, much as we might prize authenticity, we have other desires, too. We want to handle difficult situations appropriately, feel embraced by others, and accomplish our goals — and most of us also want to feel happier and more connected. Sometimes, achieving those things means going against our “natural” personality traits.\n\n“Lots of things that we may not initially like doing actually really benefit us,” says Lyubomirsky, who, as an example, offered that she now loves running but took a while to get into it. “A lot of things in life don’t feel natural at first. … Just because it doesn’t feel comfortable and natural doesn’t mean it’s not authentic.” Authenticity can come from familiarity, and the only way to build familiarity is through experience.\n\nA desire to remain “authentic” is one reason people may balk at the idea of changing themselves — either through personality change or otherwise. But living authentically can also mean acting in ways that feel, at first, uncomfortable, as long as those actions draw you closer to your values and goals. Many of us, if we followed the North Star of “authenticity,” would quit our jobs, neglect our families, and watch Love Is Blind all day. But what is instinctive is not always best.\n\nThis doesn’t mean behaving like an extrovert constantly, just occasionally. I told Zelenski about a time I had to collect “man on the street” interviews as a reporter — a horrible task that involves approaching random strangers and lobbing questions at them in an attempt to find a pattern of responses for your story. One freezing cold night in New Jersey, I didn’t conceal my misery well enough. As I mangled my words and rubbed my hands together, one woman looked at me with pity and said, “Don’t worry, you’re almost done.”\n\n“After a while, it does get old,” Zelenski acknowledged.\n\nHow to coax out your inner extrovert\n\nTo figure out how to get better at these forays into extroversion, I called up Gillian Sandstrom, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Sussex in the UK. More importantly for my purposes, she talks to strangers — on the street, on vacation, even in the sacred space of the London Tube. She researches the power of “weak ties,” casual acquaintances with whom we interact, but usually only briefly. People who have lots of weak ties, who make eye contact and idle chitchat with baristas and neighbors, feel happier than those who don’t, her studies find.\n\nInitially, her research felt alien to me. I had stopped working in an office when the pandemic started, and I didn’t miss it at all. I live in the suburbs, so I don’t interact with many people unless I make a point to — and I usually don’t.\n\nSandstrom told me she’s the same way: She’s an introvert and tends to avoid demanding social situations. But she uses talking to strangers as a coping mechanism of sorts. If she’s in a big, crowded room, she finds someone who’s off by themselves and starts a one-on-one conversation.\n\nOne way to open such a conversation is by making a statement, rather than asking a question. For instance, when Sandstrom is on public transportation, she’ll test the waters by complimenting the person sitting next to her. (She recommends remarking on something other than their looks.) Or, she’ll comment on something in the environment — if they have a suitcase, she’ll ask where they’re going. One time, she was walking in a park and noticed a man smiling at some ducks. “Aren’t they cute?” Sandstrom said. She and the man ended up chatting for half an hour, since they were walking in the same direction. At the end of her conversations, Sandstrom just says something like, “Thank you, it’s been nice talking to you,” and walks off.\n\nJust like a mediocre movie wouldn’t make you swear off cinema forever, one bad conversation shouldn’t keep you from trying again.\n\nI told Sandstrom that I don’t miss my weak ties much, and I’m not really one for small talk. We either have to get to the bottom of your childhood trauma, or we’re not talking at all. The thing is, she pointed out, most weak ties probably aren’t going to become long-term relationships. I needed to set the stakes way lower. Her conversations tend to last just a few minutes, and sometimes, they’re nothing special. But just like a mediocre movie wouldn’t make you swear off cinema forever, one bad conversation shouldn’t keep you from trying again.\n\nOver time, these weak ties do benefit us, even if we don’t especially notice them. They make us feel woven into the social fabric, Sandstrom says, like we’re part of something bigger. “When I do talk to people, I feel better,” she told me. “It’s almost always at least an average experience.” And when a conversation is unusually engaging, “it feels awesome, because I wouldn’t expect there to be anything coming from it.”\n\nAs I sped home from my first improv class, I detected something that, honestly, floored me. I was smiling. Even though I would continue to dread it for months, something about the whole exercise was just so fun. I’m rarely immersed in something that’s meant to be light and exuberant, as opposed to correct or exacting. Because it was the middle of the pandemic, it had been months since I’d socialized with a group of people. The electricity of improv had invigorated me, in spite of myself.",

        "content": "is a Future Perfect Fellow focusing on the intersection of emerging technology, culture, and the mind. She is also fascinated by the process of science, the institutions that fund it, and the people who make it happen.\n\nThese cuts come on top of last month’s announcement of major rollbacks to what are known as indirect costs — money the NIH gives research institutions on top of project-specific grants to cover necessary expenses like building maintenance, utilities, and administrative staff salaries. Many universities — both large and small, public and private — rely on the NIH to sustain a lot of their day-to-day operations.\n\nAny threat to that funding poses an existential threat to higher education. Without the jobs, medical research, and technological developments made possible by these institutions, people outside of academia could miss out on breakthrough treatments for diseases like cancer, and will be more vulnerable to public health crises. As a result, the US will likely lose its technological competitiveness on a global scale, which could damage the economy in the long run.\n\nWhy exactly has the Trump administration seemingly declared war on academic biomedical research? In theory, depriving future researchers of places in academia could push them toward the private sector, which potentially aligns with a conservative pro-business approach. But the antipathy goes deeper than that.\n\nVice President JD Vance has said that “the universities are the enemy.” Attacking science and higher education, whether under the guise of reducing taxpayer waste or punishing antisemitism, was always part of this administration’s plan. But its haphazard destabilization of the scientific enterprise won’t automatically funnel would-be biomedical PhDs into pharmaceutical or biotech companies, especially when there already aren’t enough jobs in those industries now to absorb the flood of highly educated people applying for them. If turned away from grad school, it’s more likely that young scientists will take their talents to other countries, or leave the field altogether.\n\nWhile the headlines have been about STEM funding, academic departments that fall far outside the NIH’s purview — like history, or comparative literature — are also being affected. That’s because research groups in STEM departments bring in the big federal grants universities depend on, while arts and humanities research largely rely on money the university pulls from endowments, tuition, and state funding. Without the NIH’s money, universities may be forced to divert funds from humanities to STEM departments, where research facilities and equipment are way more expensive.\n\nAs a result, when well-resourced STEM departments fall, they take humanities down with them. And when graduate programs downsize, universities lose the PhD students that keep research and undergraduate education afloat. And without grad student labor, the whole academic system crumbles.\n\nAcademics are terrified, and they should be. There’s only so much instability that young scholars can stomach to chase careers that the government is actively destroying. We risk losing an entire generation of future experts, and the potential harm that could cause is incalculable.\n\nAnd yet, even academia’s stoutest defenders would acknowledge there were serious problems with STEM graduate education even before Trump took office again. If done intentionally, downsizing PhD training programs could be a good thing. While the way these sudden funding cuts are being carried out cause far more chaos than positive change, universities do need fewer PhD students — and to take better care of those they admit.\n\nWe have too many grad students\n\nFor most of American history, higher education was limited to the privileged few. That changed after World War II, when the GI Bill made universities dramatically more accessible. Cold War-era investments, many of them motivated by post-Sputnik competition with the Soviet Union, subsidized the growth of PhD programs in STEM fields, all aiming to advance the nation’s strategic interests in science and military readiness. And those fields kept growing.\n\nToday, the pool of potential PhD candidates across all disciplines is much larger than it was during the Cold War. Roughly 40 percent of Americans over 25 are college graduates, and over 8.5 million of them have a doctorate or professional degree. Earning a medical, law, or business administration degree often equips students for high-earning careers (and, in many cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt).\n\nBut the academic job market is bleak for newly minted PhDs, and it has been for decades. In STEM fields, it’s not uncommon for PhD grads to spend at least five years in postdoctoral positions, earning under $60,000 annually, all with no guarantee of ever landing a faculty job. And while STEM grads who can’t find a home in academia can often turn to jobs in biopharma or engineering, humanities graduates are much more dependent on academic employment — and those jobs are increasingly scarce. In 2020, fewer than half of new humanities PhDs had a job lined up at graduation.\n\nWhen much of what you’re producing can’t find a market, it’s a good sign you’re oversupplying. But while the glut of PhDs is bad for recent graduates, it is convenient for universities that use grad students as a cheap, talented, and highly motivated workforce. Because they are often defined as “trainees,” universities often get away with treating early-career academics like apprentices, rather than workers.\n\nMore grad students means more research and teaching for a fraction of the cost of hiring full-time professors to do the same. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, unionization efforts among grad students are generally met with hostility from administration and faculty, who fear stalled scientific progress and undergraduate education.)\n\nSarah Reingewirtz/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images\n\nAs universities are forced to pare down on graduate admissions in light of Trump’s attacks on science and higher education, they’ll have to reckon with the consequences of losing the people who do the bulk of academia’s dirty work. With fewer junior scientists, research groups will produce less data and publish fewer papers, potentially jeopardizing the careers of young professors who rely on trainees and publications to earn tenure. Fewer graduate student instructors will also mean inflated class sizes for undergraduates.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss cuts to PhD programs as problems confined to ivory towers. I spent six years earning a neuroscience PhD, and it’s difficult to garner sympathy for someone who voluntarily sacrificed the bulk of her twenties studying the intricacies of the orbitofrontal cortex. But the truth is that academic research lays the groundwork for virtually every innovation and advancement that comes from private corporations. Fundamental research — even that which doesn’t have any obvious market value — drives progress. When universities lose part of their academic workforce, the costs extend far beyond campus.\n\nThe question isn’t whether we need researchers — we do. It’s how we can sustainably support knowledge production while treating academic workers with the dignity they deserve.\n\nPhD programs have no choice but to focus on quality, not quantity\n\n“As long as I’ve been in the profession, science has run on a series of strange cultural practices that rely on uncompensated labor,” C. Brandon Ogbunu, an assistant professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale, wrote in Undark last week.\n\nGenerations of researchers have accepted these conditions as part of the job, but they’re not. Exploitative systems can — and should — be dismantled and rebuilt. Not through the chaos and confusion of Trump’s cuts, but through gradual admissions reductions and strategic cuts to brand-boosting money pits (like sports).\n\nFuture Perfect Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

NIH grants also require applicants to prove they’ve trained and retained PhD students, incentivizing universities to produce more PhDs — whether those graduates have job prospects or not. One potential fix: admit fewer grad students, pay each student more, and measure success in terms of individual job placements, mentorship quality, and research impact. Long-term positions for senior scientists and lecturers can pick up the slack, and maintain institutional memory better than a transient workforce-in-training ever could.\n\nWithout these incentives, departments won’t be punished by funders for reducing graduate program admissions or for supporting students in leaving if grad school ends up being a poor fit. With fewer students to support, universities could afford to increase PhD stipends, many of which currently fall well below the cost of living, especially in humanities departments. (PhD stipends usually range between $20,000 and $45,000 per year, with many universities paying humanities and social science students thousands less than that.)\n\nAs the foreign aid community comes to terms with the fact that it needs to be ruthless about prioritizing what it can do with fewer resources, academia may need to do the same. As devastating as these cuts to higher education are, it may be the shock the system needs to make much-needed changes. Pulling the rug out from under hopeful PhD applicants was not the way to downsize academia — but we do have too many PhDs. On the other side of this chaos, if there’s anything left at all, could be a pared-down system that prioritizes quality over quantity.\n\nThe Economist published a cynical take on grad school back in 2010: “Many of those who embark on a PhD are the smartest in their class and will have been the best at everything they have done,” they write. “Few will be willing to accept that the system they are entering could be designed for the benefit of others, that even hard work and brilliance may well not be enough to succeed, and that they would be better off doing something else.”\n\nBut producing specialized knowledge creators and expert researchers is a good deal for any country trying to solve big societal problems, and devaluing it risks driving smart people out of the US, where their work is under attack. While PhD programs often fail to teach students how to teach, communicate with regular people, or navigate corporate politics, they do train people to read deeply, plan challenging projects, and execute them with discipline. We need that now more than ever.\n\nYou’ve read 1 article in the last month Here at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.

He has reported on health policy for more than 10 years, writing for Governing magazine, Talking Points Memo, and STAT before joining Vox in 2017.\n\nOne of America’s worst measles outbreaks in recent years continues to spread, with 292 reported cases in western Texas and eastern New Mexico as of March 17. A nearby Oklahoma county has confirmed its first case, which officials believed to be linked to the outbreak’s epicenter in Gaines County, Texas. Two people have so far died from measles infections since the outbreak began in late January.\n\nThe actual number of cases is likely higher than the official count, based on reports from doctors who are treating patients as well as statistical analysis (two deaths would suggest thousands of cases, based on the measles’ mortality rate of roughly 1 in 1,000 infections). Officials fear the virus’s spread could persist into the spring and summer travel seasons, allowing the virus to reach other parts of the country; more cases and deaths could follow.\n\nThe outbreak has now exceeded the total number of reported measles cases in the US last year, which itself had already represented an increase from 2023. Measles vaccination rates in most US states have fallen below the 95 percent threshold scientists consider necessary to control the disease, and those rates have continued to drop. The Texas emergency appears to have begun in an insular religious community with high vaccination exemption rates; 14 percent of all children in Gaines County have exemptions.\n\nThe nation’s health leadership, meanwhile, is undermining the best defense against measles. While US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has paid lip service to the value of vaccines, he has also pitched alternative treatments unsupported by medical science. He’s also launching new government investigations into the long-debunked theory linking autism and vaccines — investigations seem designed to erode public trust in the measles shot’s safety at the very moment it is most needed.\n\nWhat’s happening right now could only be the beginning. The more the US strays from the public health playbook that helped the country to reach official measles elimination in 2000, the more outbreaks will likely occur — and the bigger they’ll be.\n\nWe may be entering a new era when this once-dormant virus is again an active threat to people’s health. Here’s what you can do to protect yourself and your family.\n\nYou really, really don’t want to get measles\n\nMost Americans have been lucky enough to live in a world without measles, a disease that globally still kills over 100,000 people, most of them young children. Its risks, therefore, have become largely hypothetical.\n\nBut for the unvaccinated, those risks are real. Measles is a formidable and extremely contagious virus. It is dangerous during the initial infection, which can lead to high fever and the signature measles rash, while some patients will go on to develop pneumonia or encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, both of which can be deadly.\n\nMeasles has a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, but an estimated 20 percent of cases require hospitalization. The disease is particularly threatening to kids, especially young infants, as well as pregnant women and people who are immunocompromised.\n\nSome vaccine skeptics, including RFK Jr., downplay the risk of measles. “It used to be, when I was a kid, that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection,” he said recently on Fox News. But measles was and is not some harmless disease: Between 400 to 500 children died annually from measles in the US in the decade before a vaccine was introduced in 1963. From 1968 to 2016, there were about 550 measles deaths total in the US, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Until the recent deaths in the Texas outbreak, it had been 10 years since a single measles death had been recorded in the US.\n\nEven those who do survive a measles infection can face long-term health consequences, particularly for those in high-risk groups. Some of those infected in the current outbreak may be dealing with the fallout for years.\n\nMeasles can cause what’s known as immunity amnesia. The virus can wipe out more than half a person’s preexisting antibodies that protect them against other pathogens, which can leave them more vulnerable to other diseases for years after their infection.\n\nIn rare cases, measles can lead to fatal brain swelling years after the initial infection. Patients can also suffer hearing loss from ear infections experienced during their illness, while those who develop acute encephalitis can suffer permanent neurological damage.\n\nWhat you can do to protect yourself from measles\n\nVaccination remains the best defense against measles: Two doses of the MMR vaccine — given to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella — is 97 percent effective at preventing a measles infection (and therefore spread). It is perhaps the most effective vaccine we have for any disease, and any risks from the vaccine are astonishingly low compared to the dangers of measles itself.\n\nIn this new world where you’re more likely to see a measles outbreak in your community, people should consider taking steps to protect their health or that of their loved ones. Here’s what you can do.\n\nParents, if you have young children—the group most at risk from measles — talk to your pediatrician about vaccination. The usual schedule is one shot around age 1 and another shot around age 5, but there is some flexibility. The CDC already advises that infants as young as 6 months can receive one dose if they are traveling internationally, and the recommended age for the second dose ranges from 4 to 6 years old. Several leading public health experts, including former CDC director Rochelle Walensky, wrote in a recent JAMA op-ed that the recommendations should be updated to advise one shot for infants traveling in the US to areas with higher risk of exposure.\n\nReports of vaccinated people getting sick in Texas have at the same time raised questions about how protected vaccinated people actually are. As good as it is, 97 percent effectiveness isn’t 100 percent, and it is possible to be vaccinated and still get sick. For a small percentage of people, the vaccine simply doesn’t produce immunity. It is also possible that immunity could wane over time, but that was previously not an issue because high vaccination rates had snuffed out the virus’s spread.\n\nIn part because there may not be a lot of excess vaccine supply, the priority should be vaccinating those people who do not have any protection at all: those very young children and the people who weren’t vaccinated as kids. Pregnant women should not receive the vaccine, but women planning to become pregnant could talk to their doctor about a booster shot; likewise, people with immune conditions should talk with their doctor before getting an additional dose, as the vaccine’s live virus could present a risk depending on their level of immunodeficiency.\n\nThose in high-risk groups may want to take additional precautions, such as wearing masks, if there are reports of measles infections in their immediate area. (That doesn’t just mean the areas of the current outbreak — isolated infections have also been found in California and Maryland in people who recently traveled internationally.)\n\nFor other people who have already been vaccinated but are worried about transmission, it may be reasonable to consider a booster shot. But there are some important steps you should take first.\n\nFirst, check your vaccination records if you can find them. If you received two doses as a child, you very likely had a successful immune response; only three in 100 people don’t. If you received one dose — as was generally the case before 1989 — you’re probably still good, but it is a little more likely that you never developed immunity, according to Aaron Milstone, an infectious disease pediatrician at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nEither way, the next step would be to talk to your doctor. (As always, with anything regarding your health.) They can administer a “titer test” that measures the measles antibodies in your body. If they’re still present — great, you should be good. If they’re not, you may want to ask your doctor about getting an additional measles shot.\n\nThe risks should be kept in context: If you’re not near a confirmed measles case, your personal risk remains negligible. If you’re vaccinated and have antibodies, you are very likely protected from the virus regardless.\n\nBut they can not be ignored either. Milstone said he and his fellow infectious disease doctors could not believe it when they heard the news in February of a child’s death from measles in the United States of America.",

These stories have shaped how billionaires including Elon Musk think about AI and fueled a growing movement of people who believe it could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to humanity.\n\nSo what exactly should we actually be worried about when it comes to AI?\n\nIn Good Robot, a special four-part podcast series launching March 12 from Unexplainable and Future Perfect, host Julia Longoria goes deep into the strange, high-stakes world of AI to answer that question. But this isn’t just a story about technology — it’s about the people shaping it, the competing ideologies driving them, and the enormous consequences of getting this right (or wrong).\n\nFor a long time, AI was something most people didn’t have to think about, but that’s no longer the case. The decisions being made right now — about who controls AI, how it’s trained, and what it should or shouldn’t be allowed to do — are already changing the world.\n\n\n\nThe people trying to build these systems don’t agree on what should happen next — or even on what exactly it is they’re creating. Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), while OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has talked of creating a “magic intelligence in the sky” — something like a god.\n\nBut whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we’re building is only beginning.

Mark Lennihan/Pool/Getty Images\n\nFor most people, the Covid-19 pandemic, which officially began five years ago this month, marked their first encounter with case counts and N-95 masks and lockdown orders.\n\nNot me, though.\n\nI was a young reporter for Time magazine in Hong Kong in early spring 2003, when we started getting reports about a strange new sickness spreading in southern China, just across the border. On March 15, exactly 22 years ago today, that sickness was given a name by the World Health Organization: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\nThe SARS outbreak didn’t get much attention in the US because the country only had a small number of cases, and the worst of it overlapped with the invasion of Iraq. But back in Hong Kong, which became an epicenter of the outbreak, we had no idea when or if it would end.\n\nLooking back on those days now, it feels like a dry run for what the entire world would experience less than two decades later with another coronavirus. Overnight, all of Hong Kong wore surgical masks. Airports, hotels, and restaurants were abandoned.\n\nAt the Time offices in the city, editors sweating through uncomfortable N-95 masks debated sending some staff to work from home, to keep the magazine going if our building were to be closed. I interviewed scientists about the possibility of a vaccine or treatment, and was told that if one were needed, it would certainly take years for it to be developed.\n\nRelated Trump is running from his biggest health care success\n\nWe ended up getting lucky with SARS. The coronavirus that caused it turned out to be far less infectious than it first appeared, and the outbreak ended up petering out — though not before more than 8,000 people were sickened and 774 died around the world.\n\nWith Covid, of course, we were not that lucky. More than 7 million people have been confirmed to have died from Covid so far, a number that is both still rising and almost surely an undercount. The political, social, and educational side effects of the pandemic were enormous, and are still playing out. It was, simply put, a global catastrophe — one of the few events that is truly worthy of that name.\n\nSo why in the world would I put Covid in a newsletter that’s supposed to be about good news?\n\nA Covid pandemic before 2020 would have been far worse\n\nHaving lived through and covered both SARS and Covid, I sometimes like to run a thought experiment: How would we have responded back in 2003 if SARS had turned out to be as dangerous as Covid?\n\nThink back to 2003. Smartphones didn’t exist, and even laptops were less common. Video-calling was essentially nonexistent — if you told someone you were going to “Zoom” with them, you would have gotten very strange looks.\n\nWhat this all means is that remote work and remote schooling and telemedicine — which, as problematic as they all turned out to be, did keep the economy, education, and medical care moving forward during the pandemic — would have essentially been impossible. By one estimate, without remote work, US GDP would have declined twice as much as it ultimately did in that first year of the pandemic. All those Zoom meetings and cloud documents were a literal economic lifeline.\n\nOr take the virus itself. It was months after the first cases of SARS before the coronavirus causing it was successfully identified by scientists. I still remember visiting Hong Kong University’s Queen Mary Hospital in April 2003, and peering through an electron microscope at the virus’s distinctive, sun-like corona. In Covid, thanks to vast improvements in the speed of genetic sequencing, full genomes of the virus were being distributed well before the world was fully aware of what Covid was.\n\nOr vaccines. In 2003, early work on mRNA vaccine technology was only beginning, and BioNTech — the company that was responsible for the groundbreaking research on mRNA vaccines — wouldn’t be founded for another five years..\n\nBefore Covid, it took anywhere from five to 15 years — if not longer — to develop a vaccine for a new virus. Had we needed one during SARS, we would have almost certainly been in for a long wait. But during Covid, the first vaccine candidates were produced by Pfizer-BioNTech on March 2, 2020 — less than two months after work on the vaccines had begun. Sandra Lindsay, a nurse in New York, received the first Covid shot on December 14, 2020, less than nine months later.\n\nAnd while advances in science were the first necessary steps, the US government, for all its flaws, acted with impressive urgency and ambition.\n\nWe never would have received vaccines as quickly without the genius of Operation Warp Speed. By supporting the simultaneous development of multiple vaccine candidates, the parallel execution of multiple stages of vaccine development and trials, and by guaranteeing a market for the vaccines with billions of dollars, Operation Warp Speed lived up to is name.\n\nBeyond the science, the bipartisan relief bills kept poverty from spiking during those first, terrible months of the pandemic. In fact, poverty actually dropped in 2021 compared to the years before the pandemic, with child poverty falling by more than half.\n\nDon’t forget what we accomplished\n\nI realize that almost no one wants to look back at the Covid pandemic, and certainly not with pride. The subsequent virus variants and new waves increasingly evaded even our best vaccines, keeping the pandemic going for years while eroding belief in them. Division over the public health decisions made during the pandemic, from mask requirements to school closures, still linger, poisoning the political atmosphere. Perhaps hundreds of millions of people are experiencing the effects of long Covid, their every day a reminder of the pandemic’s toll. The collective trauma we suffered is still with us.\n\nAnd yet, I worry that all that pain and anger will cause us to neglect the amazing accomplishments of those years. Not just the scientists and officials who got us those vaccines in record time, but the doctors and nurses who toiled endless hours on the front lines of the pandemic, or the essential workers who kept things going while the rest of us isolated. My fear is not just that we’ll forget that heroism, but that when the next pandemic comes — as it inevitably will — we’ll forget that we have shown the ability and the will to fight it.\n\nOn the five-year anniversary of the pandemic, there has been no shortage of articles about what we got wrong during Covid — and yes, in retrospect, we got many, many things wrong. I realize “it could have been worse” isn’t exactly the most stirring rallying cry after something as catastrophic as Covid.\n\nBut it’s still true, and we shouldn’t overlook the people whose work ensured it wasn’t.\n\nA version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) meanwhile granted Starlink a waiver that will make its new service, which lets phones connect to satellites, more powerful, as satellite competitors urged the agency to rein in Musk’s company, which they say is “anticompetitive.”\n\nMusk affiliates have also reportedly instructed government agencies to start using Starlink. The White House is now using Starlink “donated” by the company “to improve internet access on the campus,” according to the New York Times, and the General Services Administration has also been using the service, apparently without oversight. SpaceX confirmed that it’s leasing Starlink kits to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), amid reports that the agency might cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon and award it to Starlink instead. The company denied that it was trying to take over the contract.\n\nThere are billions of dollars at stake here, but this isn’t just about the money. (Musk doesn’t really need it.) Some people are worried that these developments represent the early steps of a power shift in the telecom industry, one that could result in the world’s richest man deciding how the nation’s communications network works.\n\n“We have never before had a situation where the owner of a major communications company is inside the government. This is a very unusual situation.”\n\nIn addition to hacking away at the federal government in his unelected position as the head of DOGE, Musk could also become the single individual who is “the dominant force in telecom policy,” according to Blair Levin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and former chief of staff at the FCC. What’s more, the US telecommunications system is key to national security, and Musk’s business interests might not always line up with Washington’s.\n\n“We have never before had a situation where the owner of a major communications company is inside the government. This is a very unusual situation,” Levin said. “It’s very troubling.”\n\nSome of this must sound hyperbolic. It’s also hypothetical — for now. I’ve been writing about Starlink since before it launched its first batch of satellites in 2019, and from bringing remote parts of the world online to connecting Ukrainian soldiers at war, there’s no doubt that the technology is incredible.\n\nBut if recent events are any indication, the Trump administration plans to advantage Starlink in ways that benefit Musk more than the people who need better internet service. It also opens the door for Musk to become a much bigger power broker in the telecom world — and have more of a say in how you get online.\n\nElon’s space internet is not better than Earth internet yet\n\nIt’s tempting to think Starlink is the future of internet service. It’s very easy to set up, which is a huge deal to anyone who lacks broadband access — soldiers in Ukraine, for example, or farmers in rural America. But Starlink is not the same as the fiber-based broadband that’s become the gold standard for internet access.\n\nFor a number of reasons, space internet isn’t as fast, as reliable, or as cheap as terrestrial broadband. That’s why Congress prioritized companies that lay fiber-optic cable with the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, which provides federal funding to bring high-speed internet access to as many as 8 million Americans who have never had it, as part of the 2021 infrastructure bill. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick now wants to make the program “technology neutral,” a change that would increase Starlink’s chances of getting grants. Whereas Musk’s company was on track to receive a little over $4 billion under the old rules, Starlink could now get between $10 billion and $20 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the Commerce Department goes through with the proposed changes to the BEAD program, its implementation would be delayed — more than one expert told me it would be by at least a year. Which is ironic given that Republicans made delays in BEAD’s rollout a talking point during the 2024 election. This process involves digging miles of trenches for tubes of cables that connect far-flung parts of the country. It takes time and costs money, but this infrastructure would last for decades.\n\n“It is truly a historic opportunity to get fiber to a lot of these places,” Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, told me. “We’ll probably never have another opportunity like this.”\n\nStarlink dishes are easy to set up, but they don’t offer the same speed and reliability as fiber. Cate Dingley/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nSome argue that Starlink and other satellite-based internet companies could get people online more quickly and without the expense of laying fiber. Starlink already has more than 7,000 satellites in orbit and is trying to add more. But it’s unclear how quickly Starlink could actually add more users, since the company already has a waiting list for people to sign up because its network is at capacity.\n\nThat’s not to mention the fact that, for now, Starlink is neither faster nor cheaper than terrestrial broadband. Starlink delivers download speeds of 50 to 100 Mbps, while the FCC defines broadband as 100 Mbps. The average download speed in the US is about 275 Mbps. Starlink also currently charges customers $80 a month for its “Residential Lite” service, while the average US internet bill is $78 a month.\n\nThis is what makes the Trump administration’s apparent preferential treatment of Musk’s company so frustrating. It’s a poorer solution that takes longer and doesn’t result in savings for most Americans.\n\nMusk posts Starlink into the FAA\n\nWe don’t yet know how things will shake out with BEAD. The Commerce Department could change its mind, and the broadband infrastructure expansion could break ground in a few states this spring. However, the Trump administration is already starting to use Starlink in unusual ways.\n\nThe FAA, like many federal government agencies, is dealing with massive staff cuts at the behest of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Just days after 67 people died in a midair collision near Washington’s Reagan Airport, Musk’s staff urged FAA staffers to accept buyout offers, which more than 1,300 of them did, according to the Atlantic. DOGE also ended up firing about 400 FAA employees. When Musk’s team tried to lay off air traffic controllers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy finally intervened.\n\nRelated The year space internet takes off\n\nAt the same time — and operating on orders from Musk himself — a SpaceX engineer started to deploy Starlink technology on FAA systems. Musk posted on X that “the Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly,” that “the situation is extremely dire,” and that he would send Starlink dishes to the rescue. The FAA has since confirmed that it’s reviewing the $2.4 billion Verizon contract and testing Starlink equipment at several locations, including in Alaska, New Jersey, and Oklahoma.\n\nMusk’s posting-fueled intervention at the FAA is a scary one. Almost single-handedly, the billionaire threw cold water on a contract with Verizon, one that will affect the safety and security of Americans. Although it’s not clear if Starlink will indeed take over this particular contract, we have a glimpse at what it looks like for a singular bureaucrat — one that sells satellite dishes that don’t always work — to call the shots.\n\n“If you’re downloading stuff to your house in a rural area, and your speed drops because the system is oversubscribed, that’s annoying,” said Harold Feld, senior vice president of Public Knowledge. “If you’re the FAA, and your speed drops because the capacity is oversubscribed, that’s deadly.”\n\nProject 2025’s surprising role in all this\n\nElon Musk and DOGE, which is run by employees of Musk’s companies, certainly appear to be operating within the federal government to promote the best interests of those companies. The “why” of it all will take some time to figure out. Less than two months into Trump’s second presidency, we’re too busy keeping track of what’s even happening, especially where Musk is involved.\n\nAs for Starlink and Elon Musk’s apparent ambitions to dominate the US telecom industry, the FCC’s cooperation is essential. And Brendan Carr, the agency’s new chair, happens to be a big Elon Musk fan. Carr first made contact with Musk on X, where the two exchanged complaints about Democrats denying Starlink broadband subsidies and blamed Kamala Harris for rolling BEAD out too slowly. Carr was also the author of the chapter on the FCC for the big report published by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. In it, he argues against terrestrial broadband expansion and in favor of accelerating the development of satellite technology, like Starlink.\n\nStarlink constellations look spectacular after they launch, but each satellite only lasts five years in orbit. George Rose/Getty Images\n\nOne of Project 2025’s main goals is to “dismantle the administrative state,” and in Musk, the right found a key ally. Musk has also found an opportunity: When the bureaucrats are all fired, someone still has to make decisions, and it’s easier to move quickly without any oversight.\n\nAcross the world, people are setting Tesla dealerships on fire to protest Musk’s gutting of the federal workforce and hoping to tank its stock. But what’s happening more quietly with Starlink, the Commerce Department, and the FCC shows that the multibillionaire isn’t just interested in making money. He’s consolidating power in Washington and helping determine what the future will look like.\n\nSelling cars is one thing, but taking control over America’s telecommunications network is another. Musk is not there yet, but we have already seen Musk use Starlink specifically to intervene in military operations abroad — he prevented Ukraine from launching a surprise attack against Russia in 2022. That sets a scary precedent for what the future holds.\n\n“Elon Musk has been pretty cavalier about his ability to turn on or turn off Starlink to influence policy decisions,” Garner, from the Benton Institute, told me, referring to a series of recent posts on X from Musk about cutting off Starlink access in Ukraine.\n\nIt’s not just scary that Musk is becoming more powerful in the telecom industry. It is uniquely terrifying that he alone could decide to bring networks down. And that might be an even more important development to keep our eyes on than the Tesla ad he produced in front of the White House.\n\nUpdate, March 18, 9:45 am: This story, originally published March 12, has been updated to include news of the White House’s use of Starlink.",

Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe spate of federal firings that stretched throughout last week escalated last Friday, and continued through the holiday weekend.\n\nNearly all of those fired were “probationary” employees, a status usually conferred on new workers, those that switch agencies, and the recently promoted, that provides fewer protections against removal.\n\nReports have been unclear about exactly how many people were fired and where. However, we do know some details:\n\nThe Trump administration has argued these cuts (and more) are needed to slash federal spending, and to shrink a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, the latest reduction in force is unlikely to provide taxpayers with major savings, and could jeopardize the government’s mandate to protect its citizens.\n\nTake, for instance, the VA’s claim that its terminations will save $98 million per year. That is a lot of money to me, but it represents only 0.00145 percent of the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. Celebrating that cut is like me jumping for joy because I managed to save a tenth of a penny by foregoing something at the grocery store. Sure it’s money saved, but not really an appreciable sum.\n\nThe point is — and it’s a point others have made — the US will need to make massive cuts, on the trillion, not million, dollar scale if it really wants to appreciably tighten its belt. To do that, it would need to slash spending on expensive programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the defense.\n\nNow to the other claim: that the government is too big.\n\nMuch like with the VA’s savings, those let go represent a fraction of the federal workforce. If you combine the latest round of layoffs with previous rounds — and even with the roughly 75,000 people who took the government’s buyout offer — then just under 4 percent of the government’s 2.4 million person workforce has been cut.\n\nThat means the government is still pretty big. The good news about that is it means government services are unlikely to keel over tomorrow. The worry is about the day after tomorrow.\n\nWe’re not out of fire season, and fire experts and Forest Service workers are expressing great concern that they won’t have the manpower to keep communities safe.\n\n“It’s just going to be a disaster for the wildfire response this season,” one Forest Service firefighter told Stateline.\n\nSpring break and summer travel season are coming in fast too. The FAA was clear that it didn’t fire any air traffic controllers, but, as you read in this newsletter a few weeks ago, aviation experts believe our flight systems are seriously overtaxed.\n\n“Right now, flight operations are like a rubber band,” the University of North Dakota’s Daniel Adjekum told me recently. “And we keep pulling it.”\n\nAnd it’s not just a matter of fire or flying: a disaster could happen at any time requiring FEMA’s full attention; the CDC might need to be called into action over a new pandemic — federal agencies were already struggling to get bird flu under control.\n\nIt’s impossible to tell you right now what the effects of these cuts will be, and if things will go as badly as some now claim. But the worry is, if things do go south due to lack of personnel, it will be too late — avoidable tragedy will have struck.",

        "content": "On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. And while, within a few weeks, that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges, it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the questions: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In the video above, we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.",

She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.\n\nMore than 250 suspected gang members arrived in El Salvador by plane, including 238 members of Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang and 23 members of the MS-13 gang, who were deported to El Salvador by the US in San Salvador, El Salvador on March 16, 2025. El Salvador Presidency/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump has invoked an 18th-century wartime law to carry out a large-scale deportation operation.\n\nAs he promised on the campaign trail, Trump used the Alien Enemies Act to send hundreds of people with alleged Venezuelan gang ties to El Salvador, ignoring a court order blocking their deportations. The law, passed in 1798 as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, allows the president to detain and deport noncitizens from countries at war with or invading the US.\n\nBefore now, the law had only been used three times in history — during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II — all of which involved official congressional declarations of war. Trump’s attempt to invoke the law without any such declaration is unprecedented and, according to legal experts, an illegal abuse of power.\n\n“President Trump is now invoking wartime powers during a time of peace to justify rounding up potentially millions of people,” said Amy Fettig, acting co-executive director of the civil rights group Fair and Just Prosecution. “This blatantly unconstitutional and unlawful power grab reveals the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda for what it is — an authoritarian turn in our nation’s history and a time when the rule of law is under direct threat.”\n\nTo justify his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, Trump has claimed that international criminal gangs, including the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua, are invading the US. That represents not only a break with the law’s past use, but a decision that ignores the now widely acknowledged role the law played in enabling Japanese internment during World War II.\n\nHere’s how the law has been used historically.\n\nThe War of 1812\n\nPresident James Madison first used the law to target British citizens in the US during the three-year War of 1812.\n\nA directive from the Madison administration designated British citizens as “alien enemies” and ordered them to report to local authorities and undertake additional duties. If they resisted, they could be deported under the Alien Enemies Act, though it’s not clear how many were ultimately impacted.\n\nIn the war, the nascent US, armed with only a small fleet of ships, challenged British interference in American maritime trade, ultimately achieving a draw on the battlefield.\n\nWorld War I\n\nWhen the US entered World War I in 1917, President Woodrow Wilson imposed a host of restrictions on male German citizens living in the US and, later, on German Austrians and on women from both countries. Those restrictions included a bar on firearms ownership, mandatory registration with the government or law enforcement, and a requirement that Germans apply for permits to live and work in designated restricted zones or to leave the country.\n\nUnder the Alien Enemies Act, Wilson also ordered the arrest and detention of Germans who demonstrated “reasonable cause to believe to be aiding or about to aid the enemy” or who violated any presidential regulations.\n\nOver 10,000 people were arrested under the law. Though most of those affected were eventually paroled, many of them experienced job loss as a result.\n\nWorld War II\n\nThe last and perhaps most significant time the Alien Enemies Act was invoked was during World War II. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the law to authorize the arrest, detention, and deportation of civilians of primarily Japanese, but also German and Italian, descent.\n\nThough his administration initially only targeted individuals believed to present a threat to US national security, the policy eventually extended to Japanese immigrants and US citizens of Japanese descent broadly.\n\nSome 120,000 of them were sent to concentration camps. They endured inhumane conditions: Many forced to live in livestock pens, without enough food or adequate sanitation. The camps were only emptied out after the war ended in 1946. The US government later apologized for their internment and provided reparations to those of Japanese descent.\n\nHowever, despite the Alien Enemies Act’s role in that stain on American history, the law remained on the books. President Harry Truman invoked it shortly after the war against a German citizen. A divided Supreme Court allowed him to do so in a 1948 case known as Ludecke v. Watkins, wary of overriding the president on the issue of whether the war was truly over.",

Callais, a case about whether Louisiana’s congressional maps are an illegal racial gerrymander, should be one of the easiest cases the justices have heard in many years. That’s because less than two years ago, the Supreme Court decided another gerrymandering case, known as Allen v. Milligan (2023), which by Louisiana’s lawyers’ own admission “presents the same question” as Callais.\n\nThe Court will hear oral arguments in Callais on March 24.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nIn Milligan, the Court — normally quite hostile to plaintiffs alleging violations of the Voting Rights Act, which is meant to protect minority ballot access — surprised most Court-watchers by reaffirming longstanding legal principles, first established in Thornburg v. Gingles (1986), which are intended to prevent states from drawing legislative maps that weaken the influence of voters of color. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, both Republicans, joined with all three of the Court’s Democrats in Milligan.\n\nThe dispute in Callais began with a Louisiana congressional map that included only one Black-majority district (out of six total), despite the fact that Black Americans make up about a third of Louisiana voters. In Milligan, the Supreme Court ordered Alabama to redraw a similarly gerrymandered map to include a second Black-majority district.\n\nThat similarity means there’s really no question how the Callais case should be decided. Nevertheless, this case is complicated because it forces the Supreme Court to resolve a conflict between two different federal courts, each of which has weighed in on Louisiana’s maps. One faithfully applied precedents like Milligan, ruling the state’s original maps needed to be redrawn; the other outright defied precedents requiring new maps.\n\nAlso complicating matters is that this Court’s Voting Rights Act decisions often depart from the text of the law, they frequently are at odds with established precedents, and they almost always seek to narrow the scope of this landmark statute. Moreover, while Kavanaugh provided the fifth vote to retain preexisting law in Milligan, he also penned a brief concurring opinion suggesting that Congress’s power to enact laws that sometimes require “race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.”\n\nThese factors make every racial gerrymandering case that reaches the Supreme Court an alarming event for voting rights lawyers, because each case provides an opportunity for the Court to do great damage to the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAnd that means though this should be an open-and-shut case, there is still uncertainty about whether the Court will maintain the status quo, or if it will choose to radically reshape the country’s voting rights protections.\n\nA battle between two different federal courts\n\nThe struggle over Louisiana’s congressional maps began in June 2022, when Chief Judge Shelly Dick, an Obama appointee to the US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, determined that the state’s original maps — the ones that had only one majority-Black district — violated the Voting Rights Act.\n\nHer opinion concluded that “the appropriate remedy in this context is a remedial congressional redistricting plan that includes an additional majority-Black congressional district,” so she ordered Louisiana to draw new maps that include at least two Black-majority districts. This case is known as Robinson v. Ardoin.\n\nThere have been lots of twists and turns in the Robinson case since Dick’s 2022 decision. But a federal appeals court eventually agreed with Dick that Louisiana must draw new maps with two Black-majority districts in November 2023. With two courts aligned against it, and no sign that the Supreme Court was likely to bail it out, Louisiana soon decided to give up the fight. The state passed a new map that includes two majority-Black districts, and the matter appeared to be settled.\n\nBut then a different federal court, the Western District of Louisiana, decided to insert itself into the dispute. A new set of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit claiming that the state’s new maps are unconstitutional because the state paid too much attention to race when it drew the second Black-majority district. This is the Callais case, which was assigned to a three-judge panel in the Western District. Two of those judges, the ones appointed by Donald Trump, agreed with the plaintiffs and struck down the new maps.\n\nSo Louisiana is now subject to two competing court orders. The first, from Dick, forbids it from using the old single-Black-district maps. The second, from the two Trump judges in the Western District, forbids it from using the new maps the state legislature enacted to comply with Dick’s order.\n\nIn May 2024, the Court handed down a brief order permitting the state to use the new, two-Black-district maps during the 2024 election. The question before the Court now is whether to make that order permanent, allowing Louisiana to use the new maps until the next redistricting cycle begins after the 2030 census.\n\nDick is clearly correct, and the two Trump judges are clearly wrong, about Louisiana’s maps\n\nIf the Louisiana dispute is so similar to Milligan, how did the Western District justify its decision striking down Louisiana’s new maps? The short answer is that the two Trump judges behind that decision focused on a different line of Supreme Court cases which establish that the Constitution forbids states from using “race as the predominant factor in drawing district lines unless it has a compelling reason.” The two Western District judges essentially concluded that race predominated in the Louisiana legislature’s decision to draw the new maps, because it knew it had to include at least two Black-majority districts to comply with Dick’s order.\n\nThe problem with this conclusion is that the Supreme Court has long held that states may consider race when they need to do so in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act. As the Court held in Cooper v. Harris (2017), a state may engage in “race-based districting” when it has “a strong basis in evidence” for concluding it must do so to comply with the Voting Rights Act.\n\nUnder Cooper, a Voting Rights Act-compliant map is lawful if the state “had ‘good reasons’ to think that it would transgress the Act if it did not draw race-based district lines.”\n\nAnd it’s obvious that Louisiana had both “good reasons” and a “strong basis in evidence” for its conclusion that it needed to draw a second Black-majority district to comply with the law. A federal judge had literally ordered the state to do so. This decision was then upheld by a federal appeals court. And the Supreme Court had recently reached the same conclusion in a virtually identical case.\n\nA Supreme Court decision siding with the Western District, in other words, would make a mockery of the idea that the law should apply consistently and in a predictable manner. The justices already fought this exact same fight less than two years ago — the ink is barely even dry on the Milligan opinion — and the Court decided that maps like Alabama and Louisiana’s single-Black-district congressional maps violate the Voting Rights Act.\n\nSo how could the justices resolve this case?\n\nBecause the Milligan opinion is so recent, and because the Court’s membership has not changed since that decision, the most likely outcome in Callais is that the Supreme Court upholds Louisiana’s new maps. If no justice changes their vote from how they came down in Milligan, that means a 5-4 decision in favor of those maps.\n\nOne wild card is Kavanaugh’s suggestion that the Voting Rights Act’s safeguards against racial gerrymandering “cannot extend indefinitely into the future.” Kavanaugh did not elaborate very much on this point in his Milligan concurrence, so it is impossible to know when he thinks the Voting Rights Act should expire. But Callais gives him an opportunity to impose such an expiration date if he chooses to do so.\n\nIn their brief to the justices, Louisiana’s lawyers also propose another way the Court could resolve this case, which could make it much harder to challenge a racial gerrymander in the future. The Court has long held that any plaintiff who lives in an allegedly gerrymandered district may challenge the configuration of that district in federal court. Louisiana’s brief spends several pages criticizing this rule, but it doesn’t really propose an alternative rule or identify who should be allowed to file a racial gerrymandering suit if the current rule is abandoned.\n\nBecause Louisiana does not lay out a clear alternative to existing law, it’s hard to predict what would happen if the rule permitting anyone in a legislative district to challenge its configuration were abandoned. But if the Supreme Court were to embrace a too-restrictive rule — one that does not allow anyone, or anyone who can reasonably be identified by voting rights lawyers, to file gerrymandering lawsuits — that would have the same effect as a decision permitting racial gerrymanders to exist. The law, after all, is meaningless if no one can enforce it.",

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTens of thousands of federal workers have been fired recently, and more may be in danger of being let go.\n\nUmair Irfan — a climate change, energy policy, and science correspondent for Vox — has been specifically focused on layoffs looming over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of late. His reporting presents a great lens for understanding the firings, and he and I discussed what the NOAA can tell us about the effect federal reductions have on everyday Americans. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nUmair, what’s NOAA and why is it so important?\n\nNOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s tasked with developing weather forecasts for the United States, conducting oceanographic and atmospheric research, and developing long-term climate and weather models. It’s also in charge of fisheries and promoting commerce, particularly in the oceans, which means it does a lot of navigation and mapping work for shipping, and for offshore oil and gas drilling.\n\nThere have been reports that as much as half of NOAA staff might be dismissed. What would everyday Americans lose if that happened?\n\nNOAA has a staff of about 12,000 people, most of them scientists and engineers. If you lost half of that, you’d lose a lot of people doing the research that informs our weather forecasts and our understanding of weather, as well as a lot of the data that industry players rely on for things like aviation and air travel. We’d also lose a lot of our emergency forecasting capability for extreme weather.\n\nNOAA is one of the reasons that air travel is so safe, and one of the reasons that we’ve seen fewer people dying in natural disasters in the US: It has done the work of putting satellites into space, of having scientific ships on the ocean, and aircraft that fly into hurricanes, and has used its decades of data gathering to develop excellent forecasting capability — and one that, through continual work, is improving all the time.\n\nIf we lose all those capabilities, we lose a lot of progress that has been made. Extreme weather will stay dangerous, however, and our ability to drive the risks involved with weather down over time will eventually diminish if we don’t continue to invest in that.\n\nNOAA obviously isn’t the only agency that’s facing cuts here. Do Americans gain anything by shrinking the government the way Trump has been?\n\nCurrent and former agency staffers and leaders I talked to say the cuts aren’t going to help agencies accomplish their missions, and will actually run counter to any goals of efficiency, because remaining employees will have to try to fulfill the functions of their fired colleagues in suboptimal ways.\n\nThat said, there’s always going to be room to optimize a big institution like the government. But we need to do so thoughtfully, stepping back and seeing what our needs are, and what our expectations are from government in general.\n\nSpecifically looking at an agency like NOAA, it’s about looking carefully at exactly how its core functions are being met, where they’re falling short, and where they can be augmented. So far, we really haven’t seen that level of exploration and interest in how these agencies function from the current administration.\n\nBig picture, what do you think Americans should learn from the case of NOAA?\n\nI think it’s easy to forget that the federal government is everywhere in our country — 80 percent of federal employees are not in DC.\n\nNOAA is one of those agencies that has a very far-flung footprint, because it has to do a lot of the local research and data gathering on site, and because its mission is to protect the whole country.\n\nAnd NOAA, like all agencies, is very closely linked to people’s lives in ways they may not expect. You may not have a NOAA app on your phone, but very likely the weather app you do have, and the forecast that you’re getting from your local TV meteorologist, are informed by NOAA’s satellites and data gathering.\n\nWhile there may be layers in between the products you consume and the government, it does provide the foundation for things we take for granted. If agencies like NOAA go away, we would definitely lose things we might not expect.\n\nRelated Elon Musk is coming for our weather service",

        "content": "is a senior technology correspondent at Vox and author of the User Friendly newsletter. He’s spent 15 years covering the intersection of technology, culture, and politics at places like The Atlantic, Gizmodo, and Vice.\n\nIn a 2019 speech at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg made a bold statement. Rather than to help college kids get dates, he claimed, Facebook was invented as a platform for “free expression.” Six short years later, Zuckerberg’s company is trying to muzzle yet another whistleblower — one who happens to have written a book full of alleged anecdotes about him and fellow Facebook executives that aren’t just embarrassing but also politically damning.\n\nSarah Wynn-Williams, the whistleblower and author, was a director of global policy at Facebook from 2011 until 2017, when she was fired. The book came out on March 11 and is called Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, a reference to The Great Gatsby, which refers to its wealthy characters as “careless people” who “smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money.” The analogy is not subtle, and neither are the allegations Wynn-Williams makes about her former bosses, including Sheryl Sandberg, former COO of Facebook, and Zuckerberg himself.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nMeta took legal action against Wynn-Williams last week, arguing that she violated a nondisparagement agreement she signed when she was a Facebook employee. An arbitrator ruled in Meta’s favor on Wednesday, instructing Wynn-Williams to stop promoting the book and “amplifying any further disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments.” The book’s publisher, Flatiron Books, and its parent company, Macmillan Publishers, were not part of the arbitration case, and the book remains on sale.\n\nAmong the more salacious claims Wynn-Williams makes in the book are that Sandberg once allegedly made her assistant buy $13,000 worth of lingerie for both Sandberg and the assistant. And on a trip home from Davos, Sandberg took the only bed on the plane, and then allegedly told Wynn-Williams, who was visibly pregnant at the time, to “come to bed” with her.\n\nThings get darker from there. Joel Kaplan, who was vice president of global policy and Wynn-Williams’ boss, allegedly did several inappropriate things around this time, including but not limited to telling Wynn-Williams that she looked “sultry.” When Wynn-Williams reported that she couldn’t work while on maternity leave because she was still bleeding from surgery, Kaplan allegedly asked where she was bleeding from. Wynn-Williams reported Kaplan for sexual harassment, and Meta said it conducted a lengthy investigation, including interviews with 17 witness, that cleared Kaplan.\n\nZuckerberg comes off looking bad, too, based on early reviews and reporting on the book’s allegations. NBC News sums up what Wynn-Williams claimed about the Facebook co-founder, now Meta CEO, thusly: “His belief that Andrew Jackson was the greatest American president, his interest in collecting wine from the Jackson era in the 1830s, his desire to have a ‘tribe’ of children and his professed ignorance that Facebook employees were letting him win at the board game Settlers of Catan.”\n\nAll these personal details frankly look quaint compared to what Wynn-Williams has to share about Facebook’s attempts to enter China. Under Zuckerberg’s leadership, the company was prepared to do almost anything to shut down dissent and comply with the Chinese Communist Party’s censorship rules in order to gain access to the country’s billion-plus potential users, according to the book, as well as a 78-page whistleblower complaint that Wynn-Williams filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the complaint, Facebook even planned to employ a “chief editor” to take down unacceptable posts and to share all user data with the Chinese government. Wynn-Williams also alleges that Zuckerberg later told an incomplete version of the truth about its China plan effort to Congress. A Meta spokesperson told Vox that details of its plan to enter China were “widely reported beginning a decade ago.”\n\nRelated Why this Facebook scandal is different\n\nMeta does not like that whistleblower complaint or this book. The company said in a statement to Vox that the book contains “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives” and that Wynn-Williams was fired for “poor performance and toxic behavior.” Meta also claims that Wynn-Williams “has been paid by anti-Facebook activists.”",

He’s worked at Vox since the site’s launch in 2014, and before that, he worked as a research assistant at the New Yorker’s Washington, DC, bureau.\n\nA legal showdown this past weekend shows that the Trump administration is continuing to test the limits of how far they can get away with ignoring or defying court orders.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump officials attempted to rapidly deport a bunch of people they said were Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador — based on a new and initially secret legal rationale — before progressive activists could sue and judges could stop them.\n\nHowever, the activists did sue and, while deportation flights were either in the air or about to leave, a judge did issue an order to stop them.\n\nBut the administration ignored the judge’s order and refused to turn around or halt the flights, which handed over a reported 261 immigrants into Salvadoran custody.\n\nTrump officials cited a few reasons for letting the deportations proceed. One is that, because two of the flights had already departed US territory, the judge’s order (they claim) no longer bound them. They’ve also asserted that the new legal authority Trump invoked — an obscure, rarely-used law known as the Alien Enemies Act — is un-reviewable by federal courts.\n\nNotably, Trump officials seem hesitant to say they were flat-out defying a court order. After an Axios story making that claim was published, it was updated with an anonymous official’s statement: “Very important that people understand we are not actively defying court orders.” But the story makes clear they had the court order in hand and chose to ignore it.\n\nIndeed, the way the Trump administration’s challenge to judicial authority has played out is not through open defiance — there’s no bold “I am defying the courts” announcement. Rather, it’s through sneakily trying to get away with things, pushing the limits, looking for edge cases, and finding whatever legal justification they think seems even remotely defensible.\n\nFor instance: They thought they could get away with those in-progress deportations on Saturday. But there hasn’t been news of further Alien Enemies Act deportations since then — and, if they have stopped for now, they are at least putting on a show of belatedly obeying the judge’s order, while appealing it and hoping for the Supreme Court’s eventual blessing.\n\nThe tangled series of events involving Saturday’s deportations and a judge’s attempt to stop them\n\nOn Friday, Trump secretly signed an order saying he’d assert authority under the Alien Enemies Act — a 1798 law only invoked three times before — to rapidly deport members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang. Trump officials were trying to send them to El Salvador (where President Nayib Bukele has agreed to accept US deportees), quickly, before they could challenge their deportations in court, make any defense, or argue they were falsely accused.\n\nHowever, news of Trump’s intention to do this had leaked earlier that week. And, believing the order was imminent, progressive activists filed a lawsuit Saturday morning on behalf of five Venezuelan plaintiffs in US federal custody who feared deportation. US District Judge James Boasberg quickly ordered that those five plaintiffs could not be deported for 14 days, and set a hearing on the topic for late Saturday afternoon.\n\nYet Boasberg’s initial order did not fully block Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act — because he didn’t yet know Trump had already invoked it.\n\nLater Saturday afternoon, shortly before the hearing began, the Trump administration made the Alien Enemies Act proclamation public. Then, while the hearing was underway, two deportation flights departed the US, headed for El Salvador.\n\nAround 6:47 pm Eastern time, Boasberg issued a verbal order blocking all deportations under the Alien Enemies Act (not just those of the five plaintiffs). He specified that his order may entail turning planes around. He issued his order in writing at 7:26 pm Eastern time.\n\nAt that point, the two deportation flights had left US territory. Trump officials discussed what to do and decided not to turn those flights around. Additionally, a third deportation flight reportedly departed the US shortly after Boasberg’s order was issued.\n\nAll three flights eventually landed in El Salvador, where 261 immigrants — mostly Venezuelans, but also some Salvadorans — were turned over to Salvadoran custody. A Trump official told the Washington Post that 137 of them were deported under Alien Enemies Act authority, with the rest being deported under other legal authority. (The five Venezuelans who sued were not deported and remain in US custody.)\n\nTrump officials’ claims about what happened here will soon be scrutinized in court\n\nPer Axios’s Marc Caputo, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller “orchestrated” all this with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Caputo’s sources claim their goal was to have the deportations already finished before any judge stopped them — and they were somewhat foiled. “We wanted them on the ground first, before a judge could get the case, but this is how it worked out,” an anonymous official told him.\n\nFurthermore, Caputo’s administration sources claim that they only declined to order the planes back “on advice of counsel,” with the fact that two planes were over international waters being decisive. But this would not justify allowing the third flight to depart the US shortly after Boasberg’s order.",

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe question of what happens if the Trump administration openly defies a federal court order has hung over the United States since President Donald Trump’s second term began. If that happens, it will trigger a constitutional crisis. Now, that long-awaited crisis may be upon us.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump issued a proclamation claiming the authority to deport Venezuelan nationals that, he claims, are members of a criminal gang known as Tren de Aragua. Trump alleges that these foreign nationals may be swiftly removed under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law that has only been invoked three times in American history — the last time in World War II.\n\nSCOTUS, Explained Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser. Email (required) Sign Up By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice . This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nTrump’s claim is highly dubious. The Alien Enemies Act permits the president to order the removal of all citizens of a foreign nation when there is a “declared war” with that nation, or when “invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government.”\n\nThe United States is not at war with Venezuela. Nor has the Venezuelan government invaded or even threatened to invade the United States.\n\nNot long after Trump issued his proclamation, on the same Saturday evening, federal Judge James Boasberg issued two orders that temporarily halted it. The first is a temporary restraining order seeking to prevent any deportations from taking place under Trump’s proclamation until Boasberg has time to hold a full hearing and determine how to proceed in this case.\n\nThe second order certifies this case, known as J.G.G. v. Trump, as a class action lawsuit concerning “all noncitizens in U.S. custody” who are subject to Trump’s Saturday proclamation. That order forbids the government from “removing members of such class (not otherwise subject to removal) pursuant to the Proclamation for 14 days or until further Order of the Court.”\n\nWhich brings us to the potential constitutional crisis. At a Saturday hearing on this case, lawyers for the plaintiffs told Boasberg that two planes containing Venezuelans who were deported under the proclamation were “in the air.” During that hearing, Boasberg ordered that “those people need to be returned to the United States.” He also acknowledged, however, that once the planes land and their occupants deplane, he no longer has jurisdiction to order their return.\n\nIn a document filed Monday morning, the plaintiffs’ attorneys cite publicly available flight data as well as news reports, which suggest that the Trump administration allowed these planes to land and discharge their passengers after Boasberg issued his order. If that is true, then the Trump administration defied the order and can potentially be held in contempt of court.\n\nMeanwhile, in a second case known as Chehab v. Noem, the federal government may have removed Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a Lebanese national and professor at Brown University’s medical school, in violation of a court order requiring the government to give the court 48 hours notice before she is removed. The facts in this case are rapidly evolving, however, and two of her lawyers recently withdrew from the case.\n\nThe Justice Department, for what it is worth, claims that Alawieh was deported after federal authorities found “sympathetic photos and videos” regarding the terrorist organization Hezbollah on her phone.\n\nThere is also some uncertainty about the timing of the flights in each of the cases. In the case of the Venezuelan deportations, the document plaintiffs filed Monday primarily asks Boasberg to seek clarification from the government about whether these flights landed and discharged their passengers after the judge’s order. It’s also possible that these passengers were deported pursuant to some authority other than the Saturday proclamation, in which case Boasberg’s order would not apply to them.\n\nYet, even if it turns out that no one was deported illegally, the government still must comply with court orders against it, including temporary orders issued while a judge was trying to determine if the government acted illegally.\n\nSo what can be done if Trump is defying a court order?\n\nThe Trump administration claims that Boasberg exceeded his authority when he issued his orders, and it points to the alleged Hezbollah connection to justify its actions in Dr. Alawieh’s case. It’s far from clear, however, whether the ultimate merits of either case are relevant at this very early stage of this litigation. If a litigant disagrees with a temporary restraining order, the proper course of action is typically to wait until the judge holds a full hearing on the case and to argue that the order should not be extended. If the judge disagrees, that decision can be appealed to a higher court.\n\nRelated How to make sense of all the court orders against Donald Trump\n\nBut a litigant cannot simply defy a court order because they think it is wrong.\n\nIndeed, under normal circumstances, a party that defies a court order can be held in contempt of court and be subject to fines, imprisonment, or other sanctions. But it’s far from clear whether such a contempt order could be enforced if Trump is determined to give the middle finger to the judiciary.\n\nAs Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers, the courts “may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.” Federal court orders, including contempt of court orders, are enforced by the US Marshals Service, a law enforcement agency housed in the Executive Branch of government. So Trump could potentially order the Marshals to not enforce any court order against his administration.\n\nIf that happens, there are few legal mechanisms remaining to make Trump obey the law. The obvious remedy for a president who commits serious legal violations and refuses to comply with court orders against him is impeachment. But, even if a Republican US House would agree to impeach Trump — a highly unlikely proposition — it takes 67 votes in the Senate to remove a president. And the Senate couldn’t even find 67 votes to declare Trump ineligible for the presidency after he incited a mob to attack the US Capitol in 2020.",

He is the author of the 2018 book, Invisible Countries: Journeys to the Edge of Nationhood , an exploration of border conflicts, unrecognized countries, and changes to the world map.\n\nElon Musk has opinions on how a lot of the world’s countries should be run.\n\nBut one country tends to get a pass from the world’s richest man. He is, in his own words, “kind of pro-China.” The self-proclaimed “free-speech absolutist” has not applied that position to China’s draconian censorship regime, and Musk has defended the Chinese government’s positions on a range of other issues.\n\nFrom a business perspective, this makes sense. China is vital to Musk’s car company Tesla as both a producer of vehicles and as a consumer market. Musk is also hardly unusual among major global tech CEOs in defending China.\n\n“Musk’s comments on China aren’t out of the norm for the CEO of a major Western business,” said Isaac Stone Fish, CEO of Strategy Risks, a consultancy focused on the risks of doing business in China. “The distinction is that [Apple CEO] Tim Cook is not on Twitter talking about how awful USAID is or meddling in European politics.”\n\nMusk’s business interests in China and overall pro-Beijing attitudes also stand out among his new colleagues in the Trump administration. Trump’s foreign policy team is generally united in its hawkish views on China. Trump himself has accused Beijing in the past of a policy to “rape our country” and blamed it for the Covid pandemic, along with a host of other ills.\n\nAs the US and China appear to be hurtling headlong into a trade war, and even as Trump seeks a meeting with China’s Xi Jinping in hopes of hammering out a new trade deal, Musk’s ties to China — and the potential leverage they could offer Beijing in future negotiations — are getting more notice in both countries.\n\nDuring the recent quasi-infomercial on the White House lawn, during which Trump purchased a Tesla and made a sales pitch for the slumping company, the president made clear that the profits of Musk’s companies will be a priority for the administration. This raises questions about whether the interests of those companies will come into play as the administration shapes its policies toward its fellow superpower.\n\nChina and Tesla need each other\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between Tesla and China almost can’t be overstated. In 2019, the company opened its Shanghai “gigafactory” with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans from Chinese banks. It was the company’s first factory outside the US, as well as the first wholly foreign-owned car company in China, where automakers typically enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies.\n\nIt is now Tesla’s largest factory, producing half of the company’s cars globally last year. Musk has praised workers at his Chinese factory for “burning the 3 am oil…whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.” The remark came at a time when the factory was literally having workers sleep in the factory due to Covid restrictions.\n\nTesla has also benefited from selling cars in China’s fast-growing electric vehicle market: Sales in China rose 8.8 percent in 2024, a year in which the company’s global sales fell for the first time. (Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n“It’s their second most important market and the only market that’s continuing to grow,’” said Tu Le, an expert on the Chinese car market and director of the market research firm Sino Auto Insights.\n\nAlong the way, Musk has developed relationships with senior Chinese leaders, notably Premier Li Qiang, China’s No. 2 official, who reportedly offered him a Chinese green card during a meeting in 2019.\n\nThanks to his real-life Tony Stark image, Musk has become something of a pop culture figure in China, as, perhaps more surprisingly, has his mother.\n\nElon Musk books displayed during the Shanghai Book Fair 2024 in Shanghai, China. Ying Tang/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThe relationship between the Chinese government and Tesla has been mutually beneficial, Le told Vox. The company’s investment in China came at a time when the Chinese government was trying to spur the creation of a local market for electric vehicles. That effort worked phenomenally well: more than half of cars sold in China now come with the distinctive green license plates marking them as EVs, and China accounted for more than 60 percent of EV sales globally last year.\n\nThis has also led to an explosion of new domestic Chinese EV producers, including Tesla’s primary competitor BYD, a company which Musk once literally laughed at but which now outsells Tesla globally.\n\nTesla retains some cachet as a premium brand, Le says, but even in China, its sales are starting to slip. Musk is currently pushing to win approval from Chinese regulators for Tesla’s “full self-driving” technology. The company is currently hampered by rules which prevent data from Chinese drivers from being taken out of the country, which Musk says has forced them to use publicly available videos of Chinese streets to train their vehicles.\n\nTesla last month rolled out a partial self-driving mode on its Chinese models, though it costs almost $9,000, while BYD is offering similar technology for free on its vehicles.\n\n“China is the linchpin to Tesla’s overall long-term strategy,” said Le.\n\nMusk’s China ties are deeper than Tesla\n\nMusk’s activities in China had attracted controversy even before he took on his new political role. In 2022, Tesla was blasted by human rights groups and lawmakers for opening a showroom in China’s Xinjiang region, where the government’s treatment of ethnic Uyghur Muslims had been described as a genocide by both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nThe critics included then-senator, now Secretary of State Marco Rubio, sponsor of that year’s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, who described the showroom on Twitter as an example of “Nationless corporations … helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide and slave labor.”\n\nMusk’s China ties have also raised security concerns, given that another of his companies, SpaceX, is a major US military contractor and Musk himself has “top secret” security clearance. In 2022, Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) pushed for closed-door intelligence briefings on Capitol Hill to determine whether SpaceX had any links to the Chinese government, telling the Wall Street Journal, “I am a fan of Elon Musk and SpaceX, but anyone would be concerned if there are financial entanglements with China.”\n\nSeveral companies with links to Musk’s businesses have also been targeted by the US government. In January, the Pentagon added Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL), the world’s largest producer of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, and a major Tesla supplier, to its list of “Chinese military companies” that produce both civilian and military goods. US firms are not prohibited from doing business with companies on this list, but the list is intended to raise reputational and compliance costs.\n\nAnother company on the list, the Chinese internet giant Tencent, at one point owned a 5 percent stake in Tesla, though according to media reports, it has since divested its holdings. Tencent is the parent company of WeChat, which was once often referred to as “China’s Twitter,” but has since become an all-encompassing app used for a wide variety of payments and communication. Musk has cited WeChat as a model for the “everything app” he would like to build X into.\n\nThe true extent of Musk’s links to Chinese companies may not be fully known. The Financial Times reported that Chinese investors have been funneling tens of millions of dollars into Musk’s non-public companies, like SpaceX, Neuralink, and xAI, using opaque ownership structures that shield investors’ identities.\n\nChina’s man on the inside?\n\nWhy does any of this matter? Musk’s influence may already be helping to shape US policy toward China. At the end of last year, he publicly opposed a bipartisan spending bill that included measures to regulate US investments in China. A stopgap bill was eventually passed without the provision, with Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) accusing House Republicans of caving because “Elon had a problem.”\n\nExperts say Chinese leaders are hoping to leverage their connections to the DOGE boss to influence the administration’s policies. Chinese Vice President Han Zheng met with Musk on the eve of Trump’s inauguration. TikTok CEO Shou Chew has also been in communication with Musk, viewing him as a conduit to the White House as the company tries to navigate concerns about its Chinese parent company ByteDance.\n\nIn February, the Financial Times reported that Chinese officials were considering using Tesla’s question for approval for self-driving as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with the Trump administration.\n\n“They absolutely see him as an asset to them in any kind of negotiations, a way to bypass Rubio, a way to bypass [national security adviser Michael] Waltz, a way to bypass those whom they see to be less friendly to them on their issues, and they’re going to use him as a conduit,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), ranking member of the House Select Committee on the CCP, told Vox at a recent event in Washington. (The White House’s National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe committee’s chair, Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) didn’t criticize Musk directly but agreed that “they’re going to use every bit of leverage they can.”\n\nOn paper, a national security team that includes Rubio and Waltz reporting to Trump seems like a China hawk’s dream. And in some respects, such as Rubio’s push to keep Chinese economic interests out of the Panama Canal, it has been. Chinese officials are reportedly concerned that the Trump administration will use tariffs to pressure other developing countries to reduce their ties with Beijing.\n\nBut in many respects, the administration has been less hawkish than many expected. It’s true that Trump has slapped 20 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, ostensibly over China’s role in the global fentanyl trade, though these are less than the 60 percent tariffs he proposed on the campaign trail, or the 25 percent tariffs he has now slapped on Mexico and Canada. (Canada and European countries have earned Trump’s ire more than China, at least so far.)\n\nTrump also backed off a move to close a tax loophole used by Chinese fast fashion brands like Temu and Shein to ship to the United States, and despite having once called for the banning of TikTok, his administration appears to be in no hurry to enforce the ban on the app passed by Congress last year.\n\nTrump’s foreign aid cuts have dealt a blow to dozens of nonprofits monitoring corruption and human rights abuses in China, as well as Tibet’s government in exile. Statements by Trump and some of his senior officials, as well as the administration’s treatment of Ukraine, have cast doubt on whether the administration would intervene to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.\n\nMusk has said in the past that it would make sense for Taiwan to be a “special administrative zone” within China. In an interview in Taipei last fall, Taiwan’s deputy minister of digital affairs told Vox his government was seeking alternative satellite services to SpaceX because Musk “could cut the service [over] his personal opinion, so we don’t think this was a trustable partner.”\n\nMusk has spoken out against tariffs in the past, and Tesla has warned it could be exposed to retaliatory tariffs from other governments, but because Tesla has built relatively self-sufficient supply chains within both the US and China, the measures announced by Trump so far may hurt Musk’s competitors more than they hurt him.\n\nStill, if US-China trade relations deteriorate further, not to mention the sort of “decoupling” Rubio advocated as a senator, it’s hard to imagine Musk’s bottom line won’t be affected, or that he won’t have something to say about it.\n\n“I cannot imagine the Trump administration actually being fully hawkish on China, until Musk greatly recedes from the scene,” said Stone Fish.\n\nThe administration’s China policy, on both the economic and national security fronts, is still somewhat of a work in progress, and the hawks may still have their way, as they often did during Trump’s first term. A test may come in June when, according to reports, a Trump-Xi summit is in the works, perhaps paving the way for formal trade talks.",

Rebecca also serves on the board of the Society of Environmental Journalists.\n\nWorsening wildfires mean everyone should have a basic understanding of how to read and respond to the Air Quality Index. It’s a good idea to reduce outdoor exercise on hazardous air days to cut down on exposure. Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWe’re making this story accessible to all readers as a public service. At Vox, our mission is to help everyone access essential information that empowers them. Support our journalism by becoming a member today.\n\nIt’s not enough to trust the senses to know when it’s a bad air day. Well before you can see or smell smoke, it can start wreaking havoc on the lungs.\n\nThat haze you can see and smell on a particularly polluted day is made of ozone and fine particulate matter.\n\nFine particulate matter, known as PM2.5 (the 2.5 microns describes its size, 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair) can embed in the cells of the lung and the bloodstream, aggravating inflammation, asthma, heart disease, and mental health. And ozone causes similar damage. In the stratosphere, ozone blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun, but at ground level it can cause shortness of breath and damage to respiratory tissue.\n\nBoth pollutants can affect the entire body in all stages of life: young and old, and even the developing fetus. They come from sources as varied as the tailpipe of a truck, your neighbor’s barbecue, coal plant, or an incinerator. PM2.5 is capable of traveling thousands of miles across the world on the wind — taking, for instance, about five days to reach the US from China.\n\nThe dose makes the poison; there is a difference between moderately bad air and really bad air. Public health experts recommend monitoring changes in air quality as often as you check the weather. But you should also know some basic facts to help you determine your own sensitivity to air pollution and the appropriate action to take.\n\nWhat is the Air Quality Index?\n\nThe Air Quality Index, set by the Environmental Protection Agency, is your guide to how bad the air quality is outdoors. The data that goes into the Air Quality Index comes from 5,000 air monitors across the country, including local, state, tribal, and federal reporting.\n\nThere are actually two AQIs for air quality, one for particulate matter and one for ozone, but when you see just one AQI, you’re looking at whatever pollutant is the higher of the two.\n\nYou can find the latest AQI on the EPA’s AirNow website or by downloading its AirNow app. Weather apps are often using propriety data from a company called BreezoMeter to determine AQI and forecasts. These numbers are based on EPA monitoring but may not be identical to the EPA’s AQI, though they should be in the same ballpark. Outside the US, air pollution monitoring can vary widely depending on the country, so AQIs reported around the world may also be pulling from a mix of computer modeling and satellite data.\n\nThere are some important drawbacks to the AQI. It tries to distill a lot of information into one datapoint, and it depends on air monitors often placed near cities and not close to industrial polluters. Since air pollution can vary widely even over short distances — think a busy highway versus a quiet, tree-lined road — the air could be worse if you’re near a pollution source. Communities of color are systematically exposed to more pollution from industrial sources and transportation, and the AQI doesn’t do a good job capturing that disparity.\n\nThousands of air quality monitors pull data from around the country to calculate the Air Quality Index. While the monitoring captures an accurate high-level view of pollution levels, it doesn’t capture pollution that can vary widely block to block. Hyoung Chang/Denver Post via Getty Images\n\nWho really needs to pay attention to the AQI?\n\nIdeally, everyone should monitor the AQI. EPA experts liken it to understanding the weather.\n\nPeople have different sensitivities to air pollutants, just as people can have different temperatures they’re comfortable at. They can even be more uncomfortable with one type of pollutant than another.\n\nBut the EPA breaks out its recommendations for a general population group and a sensitive population. The sensitive group is actually quite large. If you have asthma or COPD, you fall in this category, but so do young children (under age 5), older adults (over 65), and pregnant people.\n\n“The younger the child is, the faster their breathing, and so pound for pound, they are breathing more air pollution,” said Lisa Patel, a Stanford professor of pediatrics and an executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health. “We use 5 as a cut-off for particular vulnerabilities because age 0-5 is a period of really rapid lung growth. And so exposure to those toxins so early is particularly concerning, but it’s also concerning across the entire spectrum of ages.”\n\nEven if you don’t fall into one of the sensitive categories, an EPA official explained that the public should still “know their number.” The AQI is based on large population studies, so it doesn’t necessarily help you understand your individual risk. By monitoring the AQI regularly and paying close attention to any symptoms, you can get a feel for the level at which you should take proactive action.\n\nWhat are the six levels of air quality? And when should I be concerned?\n\nThe EPA breaks the Air Quality Index into a few categories with different recommendations.\n\nGreen (0–50): The air is safe to breathe.\n\nYellow (51–100): The air quality is considered moderate, except for the most sensitive groups.\n\nOrange (101–150): Sensitive groups should reduce heavy exertion outside or take more breaks, and people with asthma and heart disease should watch for symptoms. The rest of the population may be fine.\n\nRed (151–200): The air is unhealthy for everyone. Sensitive groups should avoid being active outdoors, while everyone else should reduce their time outdoors.\n\nPurple (201–300): The air is very unhealthy for everyone. Everyone should consider moving their activities inside.\n\nMaroon (301 and above): This is the highest level — hazardous — and anyone can be at risk. Everyone should avoid physical activity outdoors, and if you’re sensitive, you should remain indoors.\n\nDoctors and public health experts urge people to monitor any symptoms as pollution levels climb, especially once the AQI is in the orange and red range.\n\nThe symptoms to watch can vary. A surefire sign to take it easy (limiting activity outdoors and potentially seeking medical help) is shortness of breath. Coughing, discomfort, and tightness of the chest can all signal issues with breathing.\n\nOther symptoms could be less obvious, throat irritation, fatigue, a stuffy nose or a headache. An EPA expert explained she feels a side stitch when exercising on a bad air day.\n\nIn infants, Patel suggests to look out for grunting noises, bobbing heads, and using chest muscles to breathe as warning signs. Kids who have asthma should have an asthma action plan set with a health provider on using an inhaler.\n\nIt’s important to pay attention to these symptoms in both adults and children while regularly checking the AQI level at which you start to feel discomfort. Starting this now will help you in the future when you need to decide what precautions to take and when.\n\nWhat are the precautions I should take outdoors, and when should I take action?\n\nThe AQI is most confusing when it falls into the yellow, orange, and red ranges.\n\nIf you are sensitive to air pollution, then you want to reduce your exercise and heavy exertion outside once the AQI hits orange. The entire population should start taking precautions when it is in the red territory. You might even want to reconsider spending extensive time outside at these higher levels, and don an N95 or KN95 mask if you do need to be outside (cloth masks will not protect you from PM2.5).\n\nIt helps to think about reduction in terms of dosage. You can cut your time outside, your exertion level, or both. If you reduce a 30 minute walk to 15 minutes, you’re cutting your exposure to the pollution by half. If you sit on your porch instead of going for a walk or run, you’re also cutting down how much pollution you inhale.\n\nWhen is air pollution at its worse?\n\nThe time of year, and even the time of day, can matter immensely for air quality.\n\nOzone is typically at its worst in warmer months, between April and October in the US. It needs sunlight to trigger its chemical reactions, so late afternoons and early evenings can be smoggier than the mornings. Emissions that come from the tailpipes of cars and burning fossil fuels interact to form ozone that can build up to dangerous concentrations depending on geography and weather patterns.\n\nParticulate matter’s worst months are usually peak wildfire season, so late summer and fall. Again, though, there are no strict rules here. Wildfires are no longer contained to predictable seasons due largely to climate change, as the East Coast experienced when Canadian wildfires caused smoggy extremes in early June. Other sources of PM2.5 include barbecues and fireworks, making July Fourth and the days that follow worse for air quality.\n\nTracey Holloway, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who works with NASA, also explained that, unlike ozone, PM2.5 “comes in different flavors.” She explained, “There are some situations where PM2.5 is highest at night because it’s trapped [an inversion where the ground is cooler], and there’s some situations where PM2.5 is highest in the middle of the day because it’s cooked up by the sun.”\n\nThough experts focus mostly on the two main pollutants of concern in air pollution, PM2.5 and ozone, there are other substances that can hitch a ride with this pollution. Patel, the pediatrician, said wildfire smoke is especially toxic. Burning trees can release more mercury in the air because of how the pollutant has settled on surfaces. And when fires hit houses and towns, they burn up plastics and petrochemicals, releasing more carcinogenic and metallic substances into the atmosphere.\n\nOne tip is to not dose yourself unnecessarily with pollution when air quality is bad. A hazardous air day is a poor time to fire up the barbecue or gas stove. You could swap out the gas appliance entirely for an induction burner. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n\nShould I be concerned indoors?\n\nStaying indoors helps, but there are some additional actions to consider.\n\nIf you have central air conditioning or can access a building with air conditioning, that helps filter out pollutants. Also, HEPA air filters cut down on particulate matter and don’t have to cost a lot. The University of Washington has a manual for building your own low-cost air filter for roughly $20, which can dramatically lower fine particles.\n\nSince you’re getting a hefty dose of air pollution from the outdoors, it’s even more important not to expose yourself unnecessarily inside. Former Director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and pediatrician Aaron Bernstein said people do this in ways they don’t realize. They might idle their cars in attached garages, or use fragranced and ozone-forming products, or run wood- or gas-burning stoves and fireplaces that pollute indoor air.\n\nWhat can my community do to reduce air pollution?\n\nThe No. 1 action we can take for better air is addressing the root cause, not just the symptoms. After all, not everyone has control over their outdoor activities, and some communities and outdoor workers face astronomically higher risk from pollution than others. White Americans contribute more to air pollution through their consumption of goods and services, yet Black and Hispanic Americans tend to live in neighborhoods with lower air quality.\n\nOne of the challenges in tackling climate change is that the carbon we’re releasing now will stick around in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. That’s fortunately not the case with particulate matter and ozone. They settle in a matter of days, so air can clear almost immediately once we address the sources of pollution. The world experienced how fast the air can improve when road and air travel came to sudden standstill early in the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“A lot of air pollution comes from controllable sources,” Holloway said. “When we implement changes to our transportation, industries, energy systems, and roadways, all of those can immediately improve our air quality. Certainly, we can’t just make a policy change and have wildfires go away. But for many other sources of air pollution, there are a lot of available technologies to make the air cleaner.”\n\nDespite worsening wildfires, air quality has on the whole grown cleaner, especially within the United States over the last 40 years, as states have reduced major industrial sources of smog. Environmental regulations have worked as intended to clean up the worst polluters.\n\n“We have already made huge improvements in having cleaner vehicles and trucks, cleaner power plants, and cleaner industrial facilities,” said Holloway. “And these have been deliberate choices that we’ve made.” Holloway believes “this isn’t a hopeless situation” as long as society moves to tackling the sources of the problem.\n\nWhat other resources are out there?\n\nThis story was originally published on June 28, 2023.",

        "content": "is a senior correspondent at Vox, where he focuses on the Supreme Court, the Constitution, and the decline of liberal democracy in the United States. He received a JD from Duke University and is the author of two books on the Supreme Court.\n\nA Vox reader asks: If we have “separation of church and state,” why do we give religious schools tax exemption? How come religious schools get government funding? Why was Trump allowed to campaign on religion and publicly sell Bibles? Why does it say “In God We Trust” on our money? Why is “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance?\n\nThe concept of “separation of church and state” isn’t quite as ironclad as you may think.\n\nThe First Amendment prohibits laws “respecting an establishment of religion,” a provision that many Americans believe should create a firm wall of separation between church and state. But the Constitution also does not enforce itself. In the United States, we rely on judges and Supreme Court justices to determine what the Constitution means and to apply it to individual cases.\n\nThat means that the amount of church and state separation in the United States tends to ebb and flow depending on who sits on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe idea that the government should play no role in funding or encouraging religion probably hit its high water mark in the mid-20th century. As the Supreme Court said in Everson v. Board of Education (1947), “no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.” That suggests that it is unconstitutional to fund any religious activity with money collected from taxes.\n\nBeginning in the Nixon administration, however, the Court started to move steadily rightward. Nixon filled four of the nine seats on the Supreme Court, though most of his nominees were relative moderates compared to the increasingly ideological justices chosen by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump.\n\nToday, the Republican Party has a 6-3 supermajority on the Supreme Court, and when church and state cases have come before them, all six of those Republicans have behaved exactly how you would expect members of a political movement closely aligned with conservative Christianity to behave. That means that the Court is now actively tearing down whatever barrier used to exist between church and state.\n\nRelated The Supreme Court is leading a Christian conservative revolution\n\nWhy is religion in public schools and on American money?\n\nLet’s start with Carson v. Makin (2022), in which the Republican justices concluded that, if a state offers vouchers to help some students pay for private education, it must allow those vouchers to be spent on religious schools. The Court also recently announced that it will hear two other cases, out of Oklahoma, which are likely to require states to fund religious charter schools.\n\nRelated A new Supreme Court case would force the government to create religious public schools\n\nIf you’re looking for an explanation for this shift, you will not find it in the Constitution, as the text of the First Amendment has not changed. You will find it instead within the shifting personnel within the Supreme Court.\n\nThe question of whether taxpayers must fund religious schools is a hotly contested one and is likely to hinge on which political party controls the Supreme Court for the foreseeable future. But it’s worth acknowledging that there are people of faith in both political parties. Americans of all political persuasions care a great deal about their churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues.\n\nIndeed, that may explain why Trump — who, as a private citizen campaigning for office, had a First Amendment right to say anything he wanted to say about religion — chose to center religion in his campaign and even sell Bibles. The Bible is literally the most popular book in the world, and millions of American voters look fondly upon politicians who align themselves with it.\n\nAnd this reality also shapes how, say, US tax policy functions.\n\nThere’s never been a serious effort to strip religious charities, including houses of worship, of their tax-exempt status. And there probably never will be, because the people who attend those houses of worship are voters, and they would likely rise up in outrage if such a thing were attempted.\n\nThat said, the Constitution has also long been understood to forbid religious discrimination. So these tax exemptions must be offered equally to people of all faiths. If a church can claim a tax exemption, a mosque must also be able to claim that same exemption on the same terms.\n\nSimilarly, there are some largely ceremonial or symbolic nods to religion — such as the use of the phrase “In God we Trust” on US coins, or the opening of many legislative sessions with a prayer — that, as the Supreme Court said in Marsh v. Chambers (1983), are “deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country,” a history and tradition that — especially early on — was intertwined with Christianity. The courts have left many of these symbolic acknowledgments of religion in place, in part because attempting to dislodge them is unlikely to be successful.\n\nTo understand why, consider a controversy that briefly flared up during the second Bush administration. In 2002, a federal appeals court ruled that the inclusion of the words “under God” in a public school’s daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance violates the Constitution. That decision triggered a massive backlash among members of Congress, including a bipartisan proposal to amend the Constitution to permit “a reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance or on United States currency.”",

        "content": "It’s not just heterosexual women who are accused of having impossible standards for their male partners. Certain men seem to harbor a very specific fantasy of how their female partners should look and behave too: look no further than the popularity of the “tradwife” or the fact that late last year, actor Sydney Sweeney was labeled “mid” by a bevy of online male commenters. If Sweeney isn’t good-looking enough, one might wonder, then what woman is?\n\nIt should go without saying that maintaining some sort of inventory of qualities you’re looking for is mostly beneficial when choosing a partner. These ideals provide a loose sketch of the type of person you want to date and how you’d like to be treated. There was a time, in the not-too-distant past, where the standard most appropriate for women to have was, “Can he provide enough to ensure we won’t be destitute?” Now, with more freedom, daters want to ensure they align with their partners on values and worldviews. If not, they’re empowered to walk away.\n\nVox Culture Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nThe issue, experts say, is that people who, in theory, want romantic partnership may be delaying commitment until they find a potential partner who checks all of their boxes — even about the most minute things.\n\nAs online dating entered the mainstream, licensed marriage and family therapist Elizabeth Earnshaw observed more clients feeling “disposable” to other singles, all the while becoming just as dismissive of those they were dating. “They might have been thrown away,” she says, “but their behavior is often very much throw-away behavior. They won’t see it that way. They’ll see it as their standards are really high.”\n\nHowever, singles might end up disappointed when no one measures up. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, among both straight and queer Americans who reported difficulty dating, 43 percent said it was because they failed to find someone who meets their expectations. “I don’t think that people are realistic at all,” says Daphney Poyser, the CEO, matchmaker, and head dating coach at LGBTQ matchmaking service Fern Connections. “People just think that I’m gonna meet my Prince Charming … and we’re gonna live happily ever after. And it just doesn’t work that way.”\n\nWhat men — and women — want\n\nWhy I reported this Many of the straight single women I know have expressed a similar sentiment: “All the guys I’m dating kind of suck.” These are smart, beautiful, successful women who feel like the dating pool is full of duds who can’t answer a text or initiate an actual date. Meanwhile, TikTok is full of talk about red flags and not settling for the “bare minimum.” I wondered: Is it that important to you that he opens the door or pays for the date? So I decided to talk to some singles to find out what’s happening with men’s and women’s dating standards.\n\nMen, on the other hand, consistently aspire to date someone hot. Across the same studies spanning decades, results show men prefer physically attractive mates with “good genes” and “reproductive capacity.” “As a matchmaker,” Poyser says, “I hear a lot of ‘I need someone who’s petite. I want someone who’s younger,’ when it comes to men.”\n\nRaymond Truong, a 27-year-old accountant in Portland, is looking for a woman who is fit, interesting, ambitious, conventionally attractive, and who shares his values. While he’s gone out with a number of women primarily from dating apps — he likes the information he gets up front — only a handful have progressed to second dates.\n\nTruong has been told his standards are too high, but he doesn’t see the point in lowering them. “In the beginning of my dating I did do that,” he says, “and it felt like a waste of time.” He also wonders if the women he’s seeing have better options than him.\n\nMeanwhile, female breadwinners tend to inspire stress among their male partners. When wives outearn their husbands, men are increasingly anxious, research shows. “A lot of these men who are not going on to college are often having trouble finding jobs and then resenting women,” says Campbell Leaper, a distinguished professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nTraditional gender roles still dominate dating\n\nOne reason for the current state of affairs in dating may be that despite society’s shift toward more egalitarian partnerships, young people still support traditional gender roles. In a 2016 study, both male and female college students said men should be the ones to initiate a date, hold the door open, pay for the date, and propose marriage, while women should take the man’s last name. A 2020 study found that gender stereotypes in first dates, where men are proactive and women are reactive, persist and may create unrealistic expectations.\n\nAmong the LGBTQ people Ellen Lamont, an associate sociology professor at Appalachian State University, spoke to for her book The Mating Game: How Gender Still Shapes How We Date, these gendered expectations are a non-issue. When someone wants to make a move, they do so. “In fact, for certain people I interviewed who had been in heterosexual relationships before coming to identify as LGBTQ,” Lamont says, “they discussed having to unlearn those expectations, and they came to see those expectations as very toxic.”\n\nAs for heterosexual singles, even if they say they want an equal relationship, social scripts can be deeply rooted and internalized. Throughout her life, Morgan Moore, 33, observed her parents dote on each other, and watched as her father cheered on her mother when she became the breadwinner. Moore, who works in ad sales in the DC area, yearns for a relationship like her parents — one where values are aligned, and where her future partner “emotionally, physically, financially” takes care of her.\n\n“You should be coming up to me. You are now, as a man, in your feminine energy and putting me in my masculine energy.”\n\nStill, she struggles to find a man who lives up to these standards. “I can’t remember the last time a guy bought me a drink at the bar in my adulthood,” Moore says. While she has no issue approaching men and making the first move, she assumes these prospective partners aren’t serious about a relationship. “The sperm chases the egg,” she says. “You should be coming up to me. You are now, as a man, in your feminine energy and putting me in my masculine energy.” This kind of talk about masculine and feminine energies, it should be noted, is all over social media.\n\nEarnshaw, the therapist, says the examples of love and romance people observe — whether in culture or in their lives — can shape daters’ beliefs around what they should want or how courtship should look. Many men Earnshaw speaks with, she says, were socialized to approach women first, but they realize that’s no longer the expectation or preference. “You’ve got a generation of people,” Earnshaw says, “who feel very stuck in ‘What the hell is my role supposed to be? Society is telling me I want a more modern way of dealing with this, but my heart and my mind and my socialization are telling me that that’s icky, and so I don’t know what I’m supposed to do here.’”\n\nStandards as protection\n\nSo it’s fair to ask: are we all just being too picky?\n\nExceedingly high expectations have given way to “red flags” — habits and quirks that are instant dealbreakers. It’s impossible to know whether your date’s penchant for cutting you off mid-sentence may portend deeper issues, but the impulse to self-protect could lead you to write them off anyway. You may be well-meaning in wanting to avoid an unhealthy relationship, but “it’s very hard to build relationships with people if you’re trying to control everything and if you aren’t able to settle into allowing some things to not be perfect,” Earnshaw says. Dating apps, which lay bare plenty of characteristics, from height to dietary preferences, make it easier to choose — or discount — others based on these qualities under the auspices of having standards.\n\nIronically, the normalization of prioritizing mental health led to greater acceptance of our own flaws and imperfections, Earnshaw says, but less willingness to tolerate that same messiness in others. As a result, minor foibles are filed under red flags and the person possessing them is dubbed as failing to meet your standards. “We’ve made everything toxic when it comes to relationships except ourselves — we’re not toxic,” she says. “We’re wonderful, authentic, should be able to be our full selves. But if somebody isn’t good at texting back, that’s a toxic person.”\n\nOn the other hand, standards provide an effective framework for what behavior is and isn’t acceptable to you in a romantic partner. Without them, you may find yourself in an unfulfilling relationship with someone who’s so misaligned or whose actions make you feel disrespected, unheard, or worse, unsafe. In an effort to pair off with someone who shares their values, singles may decide that dating someone of another political party is off limits, which data suggests they are.\n\nTo say nothing of meeting high standards, evidence points to men failing at the basics. In her research, Lamont has found that men are struggling to fulfill women’s baseline expectations: someone who isn’t controlling, someone who believes in reciprocity, someone who will commit. When men fail to clear these hurdles, some women may raise the bar to weed out those who don’t meet the bare minimum.\n\nIn her research, Lamont has found that men are struggling to fulfill women’s baseline expectations.\n\nKay, a 22-year-old psychology major living in Pensacola, Florida, whose last name is being withheld so she can speak freely about her relationships, feels this lack of effort from some of the men she’s dated. “A lot of men my age seem uninterested in moving forward in life and it’s frustrating because many of them try to hold women back who are focused on advancing their education or career,” she says in an email. “It’s hard to find someone who’s not intimidated by ambition and who is willing to grow alongside me.” While she says financial stability is important in a relationship, she cares more about a potential partner’s values and their willingness to grow together.\n\nCompromise is possible\n\nSo what hope do singles with high standards have if they feel the dating pool is full of duds? First, you need to home in on what qualities in a partner really matter and which are non-essential, Poyser, the matchmaker, says. Sure, dating someone with a six-figure salary would be nice, but do they share your values?\n\nRelated How to make dating suck less\n\nAfter ending a six-and-a-half-year relationship, Gia Aldisert, a 22-year-old content creator based in Los Angeles, reevaluated what she wanted out of a partner. While she admits her past relationship wasn’t unhealthy, there were some boxes her ex left unchecked, some areas where she felt she was settling. Her current list of standards for a boyfriend includes someone ambitious, who embraces romantic gestures, who makes time for her friends and family, and who wants to show her off. “I feel like a major way that dating as a whole for women [changed] is that they understand their value now and they don’t just settle for the first guy that treats them with the bare minimum,” Aldisert says.\n\nStandards are only as good as your ability to reciprocate, Poyser says. If you hope to date someone who prioritizes their career, you should be able to say the same about yourself. “If I’m going to say I want someone who is kind and thoughtful,” Poyser says, “then I need to be kind and thoughtful too.”\n\nYou may also want to interrogate the source of your expectations, especially ones rooted in established gender roles. Singles shouldn’t be ashamed to admit to themselves if they do yearn for more stereotypical dating scripts, such as a man pursuing a woman, Earnshaw says. But you might also come to the realization that you were socialized to believe you desired these traditional dating roles. In reality, many relationships will have some combination of “traditional” and modern: a woman may not care that she outearns the men she dates, but she would like a long-term partner who cares for the lawn and the car. “Just lean into it,” Earnshaw says. “You want traditional? Fine. You’ll find somebody out there that’s like that, but then you have to be willing to lean into that. If you want to be the one to talk to this guy in the bar … then you got to do it.”\n\n“I usually recommend people do three dates in three totally different places,” he says. “Actually give people chances and try to do fun things that you would do anyway.”\n\nStandards can help guide your romantic choices, but they’re best utilized once you have a fair assessment of the person you’re dating. Paul Eastwick, a psychology professor at the University of California, Davis, says we generally don’t have a good read on someone until the third date — so don’t immediately write them off if you’re not instantly physically attracted or felt their jokes were lacking. “I usually recommend people do three dates in three totally different places,” he says. “Actually give people chances and try to do fun things that you would do anyway.”\n\nBut maybe it’s time to unburden yourself from the tyranny of rigid standards anyway. In one of his studies, Eastwick and his collaborators found that while participants tended to be romantically attracted to people who had the qualities they were looking for in an ideal partner, they were equally as attracted to people who had qualities other study participants listed as ideal. In other words, what we think we want in a romantic partner doesn’t matter so much.",

He is the author of “Within Our Means,” a biweekly newsletter on ending poverty in America.\n\nA Vox reader asks: What is wealth inequality and class warfare and why is it extra bad at this point in time?\n\n“Wealth” is someone’s net worth — that is, their assets (like savings, stock portfolios, and the value of their property) minus their debts (like student loans). “Wealth inequality” is measured by looking at how total wealth is spread out across the population. The more wealth there is at the top, the more inequality there is because there’s less to go around for everyone else.\n\nExplain It to Me The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

Even though incomes across the board rose at relatively similar rates in the decades after World War Two, incomes at the very top started to grow much faster after the 1970s — a trend that’s driven, at least in part, by shrinking union membership. For instance, CEOs’ compensation has grown by 1,085 percent since 1978 while the average worker’s salary has only grown by 24 percent.\n\nAnd though wages at the bottom have grown at a faster clip than those at the top in recent years, that change has not been enough to reverse the overall trend. Since 1979, the top 1 percent of earners saw their wages grow by 182 percent; the bottom 90 percent saw their wages grow by 44 percent. As a result, the concentration of money at the top of the income ladder is at the highest it’s been in nearly 100 years.\n\nBut that’s income inequality, which just looks at the distribution of people’s wages. What’s more extreme is the gap in wealth between rich and poor households. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the bottom half of households have an average net worth of $51,000. Collectively, they own just 2.5 percent of household wealth in the country. By contrast, the top 10 percent of households had an average net worth of nearly $7 million and own more than two-thirds of household wealth — a share that has only been growing over the last three decades.\n\nThere are other worrying aspects of the wealth gap, including racial inequality. On average, for every $1 that white families owned, Black families and Latino families owned 23 cents and 19 cents, respectively.\n\nClass warfare, or class conflict, happens when the tension between social classes comes to a boil. That happens when the interests of different classes diverge, building resentment between them. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of protest or revolt and is generally viewed as a struggle between workers and the ruling class or elites in society. Sometimes this gets violent, as was the case in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, when workers in multiple states went on strike after railroad workers saw their wages get repeatedly cut. Eventually the rebellion was squashed by the National Guard and private militias, and about 100 people were killed.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nPart of the reason you might be hearing phrases like “wealth inequality” or “class warfare” more often these days is because the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few has been on full display. In January, for example, Donald Trump, a billionaire, was sworn in as president while being surrounded by other billionaires. (There were many, many millionaires in the audience as well.) So as most Americans who watched Trump’s inaugural address saw it on their screens, a handful of the world’s richest men had a front-row seat. In fact, the combined wealth of everyone at the Capitol that day topped $1.2 trillion.\n\nAt its very core, the reason this level of inequality is bad is because it’s deeply unfair. But it’s not just a matter of fairness. It’s also dangerous. The fact that so few people own so much wealth is a threat to democracy.\n\nIn his farewell address, former President Joe Biden warned the nation that the United States was becoming an oligarchy — a system of government in which power is only shared by a small group of elites. It’s a warning that politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have been talking about for years, especially after the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United allowed corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.\n\nRelated Elon Musk and the age of shameless oligarchy\n\nThe hoarding of wealth is already having an impact on our government. Since Trump returned to the White House, he’s handed over a lot of power to Elon Musk, who, with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars, stands to be the world’s richest man. And while Musk is charged with gutting the federal workforce, he’s not required to adhere to certain government standards.\n\nWhy is it that Musk has been able to evade the ethics rules that typically apply to other government personnel? And why is it, anyway, that Musk — now an unelected bureaucrat — has so much influence over policymaking? The answer is that Musk likely gained access to so much power because he spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the election last year in an attempt to help Republicans win, and his investment seems to have paid off. He operates by different rules than everyone else because he can simply buy his way to the White House.\n\nThe concentration of wealth has also degraded some of the country’s institutions outside of government. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for example, who owns the Washington Post, directed the newspaper’s opinion pages to avoid publishing views that are in conflict with his own, focusing their coverage on “personal liberties and free markets.” Bezos also killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris last fall.\n\nIt’s not necessarily the case, though, that America is on the brink of a class war, despite the fact that there’s so much inequality that billionaires are taking joyrides to space while millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet. In fact, the last election cycle showed that people in different income brackets are becoming less politically divided, with Trump making gains among poorer voters, who historically have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.\n\nBut if history is any guide, this level of inequality is unsustainable, and the economy might course-correct. Between 1800 and 1920, for example, inequality in the US grew very quickly. But in the 60 years that followed, the gap between rich and poor shrank significantly. During that period, the wealth of the average family grew 40 times its size while the wealthiest Americans saw their fortunes double.",

His coverage focuses on all things cinema, from the intricacies of film history to the nuts and bolts of filmmaking.\n\nIn 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he’s convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks … good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baillie told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on the movie. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how all this was pulled off, check out Vox Video’s latest!",

Waiting in line for rides, I’d been checking my phone reflexively, tapping app icons. Like many distracted parents, this triggered a pang of guilt that I was looking at a screen instead of being more present for my little one. I do it at home, too, and I’d like to stop.\n\nIronic that I was distracted once again by a notification telling me to look at my phone in order to learn how to look at my phone less.\n\nScreen time reports — the weekly roundups of time spent on various apps that Apple and Google send its users — are a cornerstone of digital wellness, a concept that’s been around for over a decade. To some, digital wellness might mean simply using their phone less, and to others, it might mean cutting down on distractions, like unwanted notifications.\n\nUser Friendly A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\nFollowing some public backlash about how smartphones were exacerbating mental health issues for young people, Apple and Google gave people additional tools to track and restrict their device usage. In 2018, Apple announced Screen Time, and Google launched its Digital Wellbeing features for Android. These settings were essentially adult versions of existing features that let parents limit their children’s devices, including setting time limits on certain apps. In effect, you could now parent yourself when it comes to digital wellness.\n\nIt’s been seven years now, and I’m not sure I feel digitally well.\n\nIt’s been seven years now, and I’m not sure I feel digitally well. While I’ve experimented with a combination of hacks in my phone’s accessibility settings and tinkered with third-party apps that nudge my behavior away from bad habits, like many people, I still look at my phone more than I’d like to. And I still ended up being that dad at Disney World checking my notifications.\n\nThere is one thing that has helped my phone habits, however. I made my home screen as boring as I could. And when that doesn’t work, I just leave it behind.\n\nScreen time has always been a poor metric\n\nThe mission of digital wellness tools from Apple and Google has always seemed confused. After all, it’s counterintuitive that tech companies would release a set of features designed to make you use their products less. Apple and Google don’t actually want you to put your phone down. They just want you to like them.\n\nAbout a decade ago, a wave of anxiety that smartphones were damaging our brains and, especially, our children’s brains hit the tech industry. In a 2017 Atlantic article, psychologist Jean Twenge asked if smartphones had “destroyed a generation.” The following year, two prominent Wall Street investors asked Apple to study how its products were affecting our health. Screen Time was the company’s answer. Google launched its Digital Wellbeing tools around the same time. Many social media apps, including Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, now offer features like these, too, usually in the form of parental controls.\n\n3 easy things to do Nobody should feel helpless in our app-saturated world. But you can update a few simple settings to make your phone less habit-forming. Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, offered three tips in a 2018 Vox video that still make sense today: Turn off all nonhuman notifications Make your screen grayscale Restrict your home screen to essential, everyday tools\n\nApple’s Screen Time reports show you some basic stats: total screen time, time spent on individual apps, the number of times you picked up your phone, and total notifications. You can also set time limits for apps as well as downtime, so that only certain apps are available for a period of time. Google’s Digital Wellbeing reports are virtually identical. This is all buried in your device’s settings, and on Apple devices, the data gets deleted after seven days.\n\nThis information is kind of interesting if you’re someone who likes looking at stats to spot patterns. It’s almost like fitness tracking for your attention. But unlike Apple’s Health and Fitness apps which, if you have an Apple Watch, will proactively prompt you to stand up or alert you to loud noises, Screen Time just passively collects this information and delivers it to you once a week through a push alert.\n\nAlthough there’s been a lot of focus on screen time for the past decade, knowing the amount of time you’ve spent staring at a screen isn’t all that helpful. And when it comes to social media apps, it’s a really poor metric, according to Amira Skeggs, a researcher at Cambridge.\n\n“When you say screen time, that could be someone calling their mom on WhatsApp and having a beautiful conversation, really fulfilling, or it could be a 14-year-old looking at self-harm content on TikTok,” Skeggs explained. “And those two things are equated as screen time, and obviously those relationships to well-being are going to be vastly different.”\n\nThe fact that these reports give you numbers and little actionable information is a well-covered topic. The New York Times reported as early as 2019 that “‘Screen time’ is over.” The Atlantic called Screen Time reports “The Worst Feature Apple Ever Made” last year, and Wired said “Tracking Screen Time Is Ruining Your Life” in 2023. These are melodramatic takes, in my opinion, but I do wonder if there’s more that Apple and Google could be doing.\n\nYou need a nudge\n\nTogether, the software made by Apple and Google are running on over 98 percent of mobile devices worldwide. If Apple and Google really wanted to, they could be doing a lot more to integrate digital wellness features into their operating systems. A nudge here or there — something as simple as prompting people to take a break — could help billions of people stop doomscrolling.\n\n“If it was a priority for them, you would be seeing better integration,” Andrew Przybylski, a professor of technology and human behavior at the Oxford Internet Institute, told me. He went on to explain that you can’t easily export Screen Time data and you can’t enroll in clinical trials about your device usage like you can with Apple Health data. Apple does make certain device usage data available to researchers through its SensorKit framework. Researchers also have very little insight into how Apple and Google develop Screen Time and Digital Wellbeing features.\n\n“There are just things in the last seven years that are missing that you would expect,” Przybylski added. “You would expect that there actually would be some independent testing to show that they work.”\n\nI asked Apple and Google about integrating digital wellness tools into their operating systems. Apple declined to comment. Google emphasized that the latest Digital Wellbeing features, namely Heads Up and Screen Time Reminders, are designed to remind users about their phone usage at any given moment without pointing them to a chart. Meanwhile, parental controls have been separated out into a suite of features called Google Family Link.\n\n“The goal is to use technology for joy and fun, and shift users from passive consumption to conscious choice,” said Daniel Goulding, a product manager for Android at Google.\n\nWhen you compare these incremental improvements to third-party digital wellness apps, you can start to get a handle on just how much more Apple and Google could be doing. I’ve spent the last couple of weeks testing out three popular ones — Forest, One Sec, Freedom — and although my reflexive phone-checking isn’t cured, I’m a lot more mindful about how I spend my attention looking at screens.\n\nForest is my favorite app so far. Borrowing from the Pomodoro time management technique , it lets you “plant” a digital tree, and for a set amount of time, you can’t leave the app or the tree will die. Forest rewards you with tokens for focus sessions that you can use to unlock new kinds of trees to plant. It’s $4 to download and own, and it’s oddly compelling to use.\n\nOne Sec , which has a more complicated setup process, essentially adds a time delay when you try to open certain apps. It lets you create custom interventions for each app, including simple tasks to complete before an app will open and activating your front-facing camera to look yourself in the eye before proceeding to doomscroll. The free version lets you do this with one app, and for $20 a year, the Pro version gives you unlimited apps as well as a few other features\n\nFreedom is even more comprehensive and gives you granular control over which apps and websites to block during certain situations. Because it taps into Apple’s Screen Time API, which lets it communicate with your phone’s operating system, Freedom can completely change the way your phone works when it’s on, dimming blocked app icons and preventing websites from loading in Safari. It costs $40 a year.\n\nWhat’s really worked in terms of helping me be on my phone less is just making it less interesting. Making your phone grayscale is the easiest way to do this. It’s boring to scroll through Instagram when everything is black and white. You can also try Apple’s Focus Modes, which let you create presets to minimize distractions for different scenarios — Google’s Digital Wellbeing has similar features — or just turn off notifications altogether.\n\nThe secret to scrolling less is simple: Make your home screen boring. Use the grayscale trick or use the “Tinted” option in your iPhone settings or use your Android settings to make the app icons monochrome. While you’re at it, delete as many app icons as you can. You can keep the ones you really use on your phone and use the search feature to find the rest. You can also use widgets for basic info like your calendar and the weather so you don’t have to open the app.\n\nMost of us don’t even notice how much we’re staring at screens without purpose. In a sense, I had to break my phone to get it to work right. My home screen is now monochrome and sparse. I only get notifications when a human is trying to contact me, and when I really want to pay attention to my family, I just leave my phone in the other room. It’s impossible to scroll when you can’t touch it.\n\nUpdate, March 7, 9:20 am ET: This story, originally published March 5, has been updated with additional information about Google Digital Wellbeing.",

Before coming to Vox in 2024, he wrote a column on politics and economics for New York Magazine.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris holds a campaign rally at the Jenison Field House on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, on November 3, 2024, in the final days before the election. Adam James Dewey/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nDemocrats have spent months debating how and why they lost the 2024 election. But the full picture of what happened on Election Day is only now coming into view.\n\nThe most authoritative election analyses draw on a variety of different data sources, including large sample polling, precinct-level returns, and voter file data that shows definitively who did and did not vote. And those last figures became available only recently.\n\nThe Democratic firm Blue Rose Research recently synthesized such data into a unified account of Kamala Harris’s defeat. (Blue Rose Research did ad testing for Future Forward, the largest PAC supporting Harris, which had disputes on strategy with the campaign itself.) Its analysis will command a lot of attention. Few pollsters boast a larger data set than Blue Rose — the company conducted 26 million voter interviews in 2024. And the firm’s leader, David Shor, might be the most influential data scientist in the Democratic Party.\n\nI spoke with Shor about his autopsy of the Harris campaign. We discussed the problems with the popular theory that Democrats lost because of low turnout; why zoomers are more right-wing than millennials; how TikTok makes voters more Republican; where Donald Trump’s administration is most vulnerable; what Democrats can do to win back working-class voters; and whether artificial intelligence is poised to turbo-charge America’s culture wars, among other things. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nKey takeaways • Democrats lost the most ground with politically disengaged voters, immigrants, and young people. • If every registered voter had turned out, Democrats would have lost by more. • TikTok appears to make its users more Republican. • Nonwhite moderates and conservatives are voting more like their white counterparts.\n\n\n\n• The gender gap among young voters was historically massive in 2024.\n\n\n\n• Democrats lost voters’ trust on the economy and cost-of-living.\n\n\n\n• Democrats’ most effective message in 2024 was an economically populist one.\n\n\n\n• Donald Trump is leaning into the most unpopular parts of his agenda.\n\n\n\n• Democratic constituencies are much more vulnerable than Republican ones to AI-induced unemployment.\n\nBefore we get into why Democrats lost the 2024 election, let’s talk about how they lost it: Which voting blocs shifted the furthest right over the past four years?\n\nThe most important thing is that we saw incredible polarization on political engagement itself. There’s a bunch of different ways to measure this: There’s how many elections you vote in, or how important politics is to your identity. There’s how closely you follow the news. But across all of these, there’s a consistent story: The most engaged people swung toward Democrats between 2020 and 2024, despite the fact that Democrats did worse overall.\n\nMeanwhile, people who are the least politically engaged swung enormously against Democrats. They’re a group that Biden either narrowly won or narrowly lost four years ago. But this time, they voted for Trump by double digits.\n\nAnd I think this is just analytically important. People have a lot of complaints about how the mainstream media covered things. But I think it’s important to note that the people who watch the news the most actually became more Democratic. And the problem was basically this large group of people who really don’t follow the news at all becoming more conservative.\n\nIf they’re not responding to mainstream media information, where are they getting their views on politics? Is this group reacting to the prices at the grocery store, or firsthand experience of changes in the economy, immigration, or culture?\n\nMost people have to balance their reaction to objective facts in the economy with their preexisting ideological beliefs. A strongly Democratic voter isn’t going to switch to Trump just because they’re upset about high prices. So, it isn’t too surprising that the people with the weakest political loyalties would be the most responsive to changes in economic conditions.\n\nAnd people who are politically disengaged — like every other subgroup of people this election — overwhelmingly listed the cost of living as the thing they were the most concerned about.\n\nBut it can’t just be inflation. Politically disengaged voters went from being a roughly neutral group in 2020 to favoring the Republicans by about 15 points in 2024. But during the Obama era, this was a solidly Democratic group, favoring us by between 10 and 15 points. So there’s also this long-term trend that goes beyond inflation or social media. Our coalition has been transitioning from working-class people to college-educated people.\n\nTo move beyond the why, this shift in the partisanship of politically disengaged voters has a really important implication: For most of the last 15 years, we’ve really lived in this world where the mantra was “If everybody votes, we win.” But we’re now at a point where the more people vote, the better Republicans do.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, you’re suggesting that Democrats cannot rebuild a national majority merely by juicing higher turnout, since registered voters as a whole were more pro-Trump in 2024 than those who actually showed up at the polls.\n\nNevertheless, many progressives have attributed Harris’s loss to depressed turnout among Democratic voters specifically. They point to the fact that, between 2020 and 2024, the Democratic presidential nominee’s vote total fell by significantly more than Trump’s tally increased. And they also note that, according to AP VoteCast, only 4 percent of Biden 2020 voters backed Trump last year — while a roughly equal percentage of Trump 2020 voters switched to Kamala. So, in their telling, if defections roughly canceled out while a large number of voters went from supporting Biden to staying home, then clearly the problem was inadequate Democratic turnout. So if Harris had focused more on energizing the progressive base, she might have won. What do you think is wrong with that narrative?\n\nWell, the problem with the AP VoteCast data is that it was released the day after the election. There was just a lot of information that they didn’t have at the time. At this point, voter file data has been released for enough states to account for an overwhelming majority of the 2024 vote. And what’s really cool about having that data is that you can really decompose what fraction of the change in vote share was people changing their mind versus changes in who voted.\n\nAnd when you do that, you see that roughly 30 percent of the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024 was changes in who voted — changes in turnout. But the other 70 percent was people changing their mind. And that’s in line with the breakdown we’ve seen for most elections in the past 30 years.\n\nThe reality is that these things always tend to move in the same direction — parties that lose ground with swing voters tend to simultaneously see worse turnout. And for a simple reason. There were a lot of Democratic voters who were angry at their party last year. And they were mostly moderate and conservative Democrats angry about the cost of living and other issues. And even though they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, a lot of them stayed home. But basically, their complaints were very similar to those of Biden voters who flipped to Trump.\n\nThe reality is if all registered voters had turned out, then Donald Trump would’ve won the popular vote by 5 points [instead of 1.7 points]. So, I think that a “we need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone” strategy would’ve made things worse.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nAccording to your data, voters who got their news from TikTok were much more likely to swing to the GOP than other voters, even after controlling for demographics. Why do you think that is?\n\nI think people can debate how much of this is the nature of the algorithm versus the strategic choices that the parties made. A lot of people argue that maybe TikTok just helps negative content get promoted, and that’s naturally bad for whoever’s the incumbent. But TikTok is also really different from social media that came before.\n\nOther social media sites are very dependent on what people call “the follower graph.” If you look on Instagram Reels, for example, the correlation between how many views a video gets and how many followers the creator has is extremely high. On TikTok, it’s quite a bit lower than any other platform. And the reason is TikTok uses machine learning to analyze a video — and make a good guess about whether it will be appealing — before they show it to anyone. So if your video is likely to be engaging, it can get wide distribution even if you don’t have a following. And that has been genuinely democratizing.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nWe used to live in this world where in order to get your message out there, you had to get people who write really well to absorb your message and put it out. And now, we’re in a world where anyone can make a video and if that video is appealing, it’ll get out there. And this is naturally bad for the left, simply because the people who write really well are a lot more left-wing than the overall population.\n\nOne of my favorite stats on this is something that Nate Cohn put out a couple years ago: Working-class white voters who’ve read a book in the last year are much more Democratic than working-class white voters who haven’t.\n\nSo what other groups did Democrats lose ground with, beyond those who pay little attention to politics and TikTok enthusiasts?\n\nIf you look at predominantly immigrant neighborhoods, whether they’re white or Hispanic or Asian or African, you really see these absolutely massive shifts against Democrats. Trump won Corona in Queens. Immigrants go from a D+27 group in 2020 to a potentially R+1 group in 2024.\n\nI’m not sure why that happened. I think we’re still waiting for data to come back. But I’d guess it’s the same stories about the cost of living and cultural issues and ideological polarization.\n\nSpeaking of ideological polarization: One of the findings in your data is that nonwhite voters who identify as “conservative” or “moderate” have been voting more and more like their white ideological counterparts over the past few elections. So, the electorate is polarizing less on race and more on ideology.\n\nI feel like there’s an argument that this was inevitable: Hispanic and Asian Americans were always likely to follow the political trajectory of other immigrant groups, many of which were tethered to the Democratic Party for the first couple of generations but then started to polarize ideologically as they became more affluent and assimilated. And you could perhaps tell a similar story about Black Americans, in which the easing of extreme racial oppression and segregation makes it easier for conservative African Americans to consider voting for the GOP.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Democrats just made some avoidable mistakes that alienated these constituencies. So I’m wondering how you understand this development?\n\nIf we look at 2016 to 2024 trends by race and ideology, you see this clear story where white voters really did not shift at all. Kamala Harris did exactly as well as Hillary Clinton did among white conservatives, white liberals, white moderates.\n\nBut if you look among Hispanic and Asian voters, you see these enormous double-digit declines. To highlight one example: In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates. Fast-forward to 2024; Democrats got only 57 percent of Hispanic moderates, which is really very similar to the 51 percent that Harris got among white moderates.\n\nYou know, white people only really started to polarize heavily on ideology in the 1990s. Now, nonwhite voters are starting to polarize on ideology the same way that white voters did.\n\nIf you look at African Americans, they did not swing nearly as much. But in our polling, before the Kamala switchover, Black voters were poised to swing 7 to 8 percentage points against us.\n\nAs to whether this is inevitable, I would say that to some degree getting 94 percent of any ethnic group is unsustainable. But I think the losses that we’re seeing among nonwhite voters and immigrants is symptomatic of this broader, ideological polarization that Democrats are suffering from.\n\nFundamentally, 40 percent of the country identifies as conservative. Roughly 40 percent is moderate, 20 percent is liberal, though it depends exactly how you ask it. Sometimes it’s 25 percent liberal. But the reality is that, to the extent that Democrats try to polarize the electorate on self-described ideology, this is just something that plays into the hands of Republicans.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily as ideologically restrictive as people think. If you look at moderates — and especially nonwhite moderates — a bunch of them hold very progressive views on a variety of economic and social issues. A very large fraction of Trump voters identify as pro-choice. We’ve seen populist economic messaging do very well in our testing with voters of all kinds. But I think that there are also some big cultural divides between highly educated people who live in cities and everybody else. And to the extent that we make the cultural signifiers of these highly educated people the face and the brand of our party, that is going to make everyone else turn against us.\n\nOne surprising thing Young people have been one of the most reliably Democratic constituencies for more than a decade. According to the Democratic data firm Catalist, Joe Biden won voters under 30 by 23 points in 2020. But Blue Rose Research’s data suggests that Trump narrowly won that demographic in 2024.\n\nHow do young voters fit into this? In my understanding, young voters shifted significantly against Democrats in 2024.\n\nYeah. So this is related to the other trends: Young people are more nonwhite than the overall electorate. They’re more politically disengaged than the overall electorate. But the single biggest predictor of swing from 2020 to 2024 is age. Voters under 30 supported Biden by large margins. But Donald Trump probably narrowly won 18- to 29-year-olds. That isn’t what the exit polls say. But if you look at our survey data, voter file data, and precinct-level data, that’s the picture you get.\n\nAnd if you look at people under the age of 25, every single group — white, nonwhite, male or female — is considerably more conservative than their millennial counterparts. And it even seems that Donald Trump narrowly won nonwhite 18-year-old men, which is not something that has ever happened in Democratic politics before.\n\nSo, young people are quite a bit more right-wing than they were four years ago. And a lot of that is replacement. It’s a different set of young people. It turns out, people age.\n\nWhat’s your sense of why this generation of young people is more conservative than we were? Is it about each cohort’s distinctive formative experiences? In my understanding, political events that transpire during your adolescence and early adulthood can shape your worldview in a durable way. So, maybe the millennial generation came of age during the disaster that was George W. Bush’s second term, and then associated Democrats with an incredibly charismatic two-term president in Barack Obama — while young zoomers associated Democrats with Covid and inflation under Biden? Or is something else at play?\n\nYeah, I think some of that story is true. Yair Ghitza has an incredible paper that shows that people have formative political years. And you can predict a lot of how conservative someone will be from how popular the incumbent president was when they were teenagers or when they were in their 20s. And so I think that’s definitely true and it’s definitely part of the story. But I think that there’s more to the story than that.\n\nIf you look at the millennials, the millennials were more left-wing in a bunch of countries — Canada, the UK, and Europe. I think that there’s a story you can tell: Baby boomers were an incredibly left-wing generation in most places in the world. And millennials were their kids.\n\nBut Gen X was really quite a bit more conservative than the Boomers in most countries. And there’s a lot of theories you can make about that — response to the oil shocks, stagflation, neoliberalism. But whatever the reason, Gen X came out more conservative. So I think that part of the story is simply that the current crop of young people had Gen X parents. And in our surveys, if we ask people, “How Democratic were your parents growing up?” zoomers are something like 7 percent more likely to say they had Republican parents than millennials are.\n\nBut isn’t part of the Democrats’ problem with younger voters about men, specifically?\n\nYeah. There’s also this enormous amount of gender polarization. If you look at the gender gap — just what fraction of the vote Kamala Harris got versus what fraction of the vote Donald Trump got among men and women — for voters over the age of 30, there was about a 10 percent gender gap between men and women. And that’s, roughly speaking, where it’s been in American politics for most of the last 20 years.\n\nBut if you look at voters under the age of 25, the gender gap has doubled in size. And if you look at 18-year-olds specifically, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to vote for Donald Trump than 18-year-old women. And gender polarization seems to be increasing in other countries as well. How it plays out varies from country to country. In Germany, for example, young women voted in very high numbers for Die Linke, the left-wing party there.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nA lot of different things could be causing this. But I think that if you look at non-political polling, you can really see evidence that there is wild, cultural change afoot here and basically everywhere else in the online world. In Norway, there’s a poll of high school students where the fraction of young men saying, “gender equality has gone too far” spiked in recent years.\n\nI don’t know necessarily what the answer to that is. But I think it’s important to resist nihilism. These young men who have terrible, retrograde views on politics and gender relations are still pro-choice. They still support universal health care. I think we need our politicians to focus on those fights. But it’s extremely important for other people — who don’t need to win elections — to try to improve the online discourse around these more divisive issues.\n\nEarlier, you referenced the divide between cosmopolitan, college graduates who live in big cities and working-class voters. And you suggested that Democrats need to distance themselves from the sensibilities of highly educated urbanites. I’m wondering if you could get more concrete. Do you think the party merely needs to increase the salience of its best issues by focusing on them rhetorically? Or are there areas where you believe Democrats need to become substantively more conservative?\n\nI think there are two very important things to understand about this election. The first thing is that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular. His approval ratings collapsed after Afghanistan and then continued to decline as prices went up and immigration happened. The budget fights in the fall of 2021 around the reconciliation package were particularly damaging. And then, his approval ratings never really recovered. And so, I think there’s a substantive angle to that.\n\nThe way that we like to track issues is that we look at 40 different issues and we ask people basically, “How important are these issues?” And then, “What party do you trust more on these issues?”\n\nIn 2020, what people cared about the most was Covid and health care. And those were also the issues that people trusted us on the most. And so the thing we had to do was very straightforward: We just had to talk about Covid and health care. That’s what we did. And we won.\n\nBut the situation this time was a lot harder. The issue that voters cared the most about was overwhelmingly the cost of living. I really cannot stress how much people cared about the cost of living. If you ask what’s more important, the cost of living or some other issue picked at random, people picked the cost of living 91 percent of the time. It’s really hard to get 91 percent of people to click on anything in a survey.\n\nAfter the cost of living, it was the size and scope of the federal government, the budget deficit, immigration, crime, and also health care. And people trusted Republicans on these issues by double-digits — except for health care, where we had a 2-point advantage, which was much lower than our traditional advantage on that issue.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nI think there’s this nihilism that’s very popular in our industry — that nothing we do, or that the other side does, really matters. But in the wake of inflation, voters went from favoring Republicans by about 5 points on the economy to favoring them by 15 or 16. And after Dobbs, voters started trusting the Democrats much more on abortion. Education used to be the Democrats’ strongest issue. But our standing on that collapsed during Covid, and now it’s basically even. So, what people care about and trust us on really is responsive to concrete events that happen in the world. That isn’t 100 percent of the story. There are a lot of other things going on. But what we do and what we say does matter.\n\nTo directly answer your original question — about how much of this is changing what our positions are versus messaging — I think the exact details of that vary from issue to issue. But I think that we have to approach this from the position that we are in a deep trust hole. The people that we’re trying to persuade have very different values than we do and have a very different perception of reality. And a lot of these people are very poorly informed and literally do not consume the sources of information that we broadcast to.\n\nAnd so, there has to be some combination of messaging and outreach and changes in how we approach these platforms, and also probably some substantive changes that address what voters see as an error.\n\nIt seems to me that the Democratic Party’s biggest challenge is less how to win the presidency than how to win comfortable Senate majorities. The median US state is much more conservative than America as a whole, and this means that the Senate is heavily biased against Democrats. In 2018 and 2020, Democrats won really strong national victories — and still ended up with just 50 Senate votes in 2021. So, how grim do you think the party’s prospects of winning back the Senate are in the near term, and how can it go about improving those odds?\n\nI think we should start by recognizing how lucky we are. In 2020, we won basically every competitive Senate race. And in both 2022 and 2024, we saw something that I had never seen before, which is that we did a lot better in swing Senate races than we did nationally.\n\nBut a lot of that was the other side running terrible candidates. And we can’t count on that happening forever. And even despite that — even despite historically well-run campaigns and historically weak opposition — here we are four years later at 47 Senate seats and with a very difficult path to getting back to 50 even in a wave Democratic year.\n\nAnd I think that something has to change in order for us to have a majority that’s capable of securing the Senate. But I don’t want to overemphasize the ideological dimension of that. What we really need to do to win in places like Ohio and Iowa is change the brand.\n\nThe candidate who outperformed the most in 2024 at the top of the ticket was Dan Osborn in Nebraska. And some of that was just because he ran as an independent. But a lot of it was that he ran an economically populist campaign that focused on issues that people cared about. I think that the moderate and left-wings of the party don’t like each other very much, but they did both like Dan Osborn.\n\nTo push back a little on that, Osborn definitely ran a populist campaign. But he also aired advertisements declaring himself “the only real conservative” in the race, attacked his Republican opponent for voting to fund the government, said that he would personally help build Trump’s border wall, and didn’t endorse Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd so, I feel like there definitely was an element of ideological moderation — or at least, heterodoxy — to his approach. More critically, Osborn refused to say which party he would caucus with once he got to the Senate. And yet, assuming he secretly did intend to caucus with the Democrats, that’s a play you can only run a single time. After that first run, voters know which party you really favor. And it doesn’t seem tenable for Democratic Senate candidates writ large to all pretend that they support Trump or might actually caucus with Republicans. So it’s not clear to me how the Osborn model scales.\n\nI think the main problem is that we tried this strategy in an incredibly red state. I think Trump won Nebraska statewide by 13 points. But there are a bunch of states he won by between 4 and 7 points. The degree of ideological compromise that is necessary to win in a state like Ohio is very different than the degree of ideological compromise that’s necessary to win in a state like Nebraska. And the current status quo is that we have a very low chance of winning in these places at all using the current strategy. But that said, I think that both wings of the party have to make sacrifices in order for us to achieve the coalition that we want.\n\nThere’s an interesting tension in your polling: Voters generally say that they would like the Democratic Party to be more moderate, while also saying they favor “major change” and a “shock to the system” because things in America are going poorly. I think many people would look at that and see a contradiction. After all, moderate Democrats generally have less enthusiasm for major policy change — and feel more comfortable with the status quo — than progressive Democrats do.\n\nIt’s tricky. On the one hand, voters say they thought that the Democratic candidate was too liberal. But on the other hand, in our randomized control trials, the best testing advertisements were more compatible with progressive critiques of the Harris campaign. The single best testing ad by the Kamala Harris campaign was one where she looked directly into the camera and said something like, “I know the cost of living is too high, and I’m going to fix that by building more housing and taking on landlords who are charging too much.”\n\nAnd I think you can get into existential debates about what economic populism really is. But I think that the existing research really pointed clearly toward the idea that the electorate wanted economic change — and cared more about that than preserving America’s institutions.\n\nWhatever you want to say about Trump, he has delivered a “shock to the system” — though maybe not the one that voters were hoping for. In your polling, has there been a reduction in support for the president since he took office? If so, where do you see him as being most vulnerable?\n\nYeah. Trump’s approval rating has dropped since he took office. His ratings on his handling of the economy, which historically was a strong suit for him, have dropped the most, and his handling of cost of living has also gone down by quite a bit. And Elon Musk has become much more unpopular and is now the most unpopular member of his administration by a good deal. Trump and Elon have really spent the first part of their term diving into the biggest weaknesses of the Republican Party — namely, they’re trying to pass tax cuts for billionaires, they’re cutting essential services and causing chaos for regular people left and right, while trying to slash social safety net programs. It’s Paul Ryan-ism on steroids.\n\nI think we have a real opportunity to return to the politics of 2012, in terms of vigorously opposing these very unpopular economic changes that Trump is pushing through.\n\nThe presentation that you’ve been giving to Democratic stakeholders takes a sharp turn at the very end. You warn that the party cannot get stuck fighting the last war, and argue that 1) AI is going to cause mass unemployment in the relatively near future, 2) this social and political shock is likely to exacerbate partisan tensions in the US, and 3) Democrats need to start preparing for this scenario. Can you explain your reasoning?\n\nI’m not an AI expert by any means, but AI capabilities are increasing dramatically. And AI experts are very, very bullish on the extent to which AI systems are going to be able to replace some fraction of jobs. The prediction markets say this, too. And I think something that’s really important is that regardless of whether it’s going to happen or not, the public believes it will happen.\n\nIf you just ask, “Do you believe that AI will be able to perform most people’s jobs better than humans can in the next 10 years?” 65 percent of the population says yes and 35 percent says no.\n\nAnd then, when you ask, “Do you think this will be good or bad?” Something like 80 percent of the population believes that this is going to be bad. And so, I think this is something where voters are ahead of the political classes of both parties right now.\n\nI think when you try to speculate about something like this, it’s important to recognize that nothing like this has ever really happened before, so it’s hard to make predictions. But we worked with two economists, Jonathan Hersh and Daniel Rock, who have made fine-grained estimates of which jobs are going to be the most affected by AI and which the least. And their work indicates that this will impact college-educated people more than working-class people for the simple reason that LLMs are advancing more quickly than robotics is. And AI will also have a bigger impact on employment in cities and suburbs than in rural areas. And it will impact women more than men.\n\nCourtesy of Blue Rose Research\n\nAnd I really worry that this may accelerate these cultural divides that politics have been centered on in the last decade, in a way that could be unproductive and dark. In a lot of ways, this could be the biggest culture war fight of the century. And I don’t pretend that I have the answer on what we should do. But with Covid, we had this sudden shock and our response just reinforced the dysfunctional cultural divides that had already opened up in 2016. And those effects have persisted and made it harder for us to win elections today. But unlike with Covid, we have a real chance of seeing this next shock a year or two ahead of time. And we really have to think about this proactively and not just dig our heads into the sand.",

(AP) — From Logan School’s top floor, 11-year-old Othella Silvey should have been able to see her house easily — it was less than two blocks away.\n\nBut after a monstrous tornado ripped through the Illinois town of Murphysboro on March 18, 1925, Othella saw nothing but flattened wasteland.\n\n“She couldn’t tell which direction was home,” said Othella’s daughter, 81-year-old Sylvia Carvell.\n\nDeadliest twister in recorded U.S. history\n\nThe deadliest twister in recorded U.S. history struck 100 years ago Tuesday, touching down in southeastern Missouri and tearing up everything in its 219-mile (352-kilometer) path for nearly four hours through southern Illinois and into Indiana.\n\nIt left 695 people dead and more than 2,000 injured, not counting the casualties from at least seven other twisters that the main storm spawned which spun off through Kentucky and into Alabama.\n\nModern standards qualify the so-called Tri-State Tornado as an F5, a mile-wide funnel with wind speeds greater than 260 mph (418 kph).\n\nPerhaps the best evidence of its destructive handiwork was found on the Logan School grounds: A wooden board measuring 4 feet (1.22 meters) long by 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) wide driven so deeply into the trunk of a maple tree that it could hold the weight of a man.\n\nIt’s on display this month as part of the Jackson County Historical Society’s centennial commemoration of the disaster.\n\n“You know the numbers: 200 mph winds. It was a mile wide. But the force that it took to put that pine board into that maple tree, it really puts it all in perspective,” said Mary Riseling, coordinator of the six-day remembrance. “To have one item that was witness to the force of those winds, it’s a story all its own.”\n\nPerfect atmospheric mix for ferocious storm\n\nThe atmospheric stew that gave birth to the ferocious cataclysm was literally a perfect storm. A surface low pressure system located over the Arkansas-Missouri border moved northeast, blending with a warm front moving north, said Christine Wielgos, warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service.\n\nThat churn “provided the warmth, the instability, the moisture” which, when “married perfectly,” produce long-track, violent tornadoes, Wielgos said.\n\nAdding to the terror was the lack of notice. There was no reliable storm forecasting in 1925 and no warning system anyway.\n\n“All they had was they looked off to the West and went, ‘Looking a little dark out there,’ and didn’t even know what it was until it was right up on them and then you’re scrambling to find shelter,” Wielgos said.\n\nTowns were obliterated\n\nThe storm took out 40% of the city of Murphysboro, 97 miles (156 kilometers) southeast of St. Louis. Its 234 deaths were the most of any municipality, with entire neighborhoods flattened. Other towns were virtually obliterated, too, including Annapolis, Missouri; Gorham, Illinois; and Griffith, Indiana.\n\nThe Mobile & Ohio Railroad yards, employing close to 1,100, were wiped out. At the twister’s next stop, it ravaged the DeSoto School, killing 38 children.\n\nREAD MORE: What to know about the damaging storms moving across the country\n\nSheet music for “After the Tornado is Over,” a morbid dirge written locally, reflects the mood of the odious aftermath:\n\n“I once had a ‘Home Sweet Home’ here/With families so kind and dear/The Red Cross tells me they are dead/Among the debris straight ahead/Death seems to come to every door/The strong and weak, the rich and poor.”\n\nIn Murphysboro, Pullman rail cars arrived to house visiting medical professionals and cleanup crews. The Red Cross supplied tents for the homeless.\n\nWith reports that the Silvey family had been killed and their home destroyed, Othella and her younger sister, Helen Silvey, 7, were shipped to Carbondale as orphans. However, it was their grandparents — who lived a block away — who had died, Carvell said. The sisters were eventually reunited with their parents.\n\nCommemoration celebrates resilience\n\nThe city rebuilt. Othella Silvey’s family erected a home identical to the one that had been leveled. First, they built a chicken coop, which supplied not only their primary dietary staple for months, but their shelter until the primary residence was finished, Carvell said.\n\nTo this day, the west side of Murphysboro is peppered with small backyard structures that were temporary quarters until families could rebuild larger homes at the front of their lots.\n\nDozens of families who toughed it out remain in Murphysboro, Riseling said. Jackson County Historical Society President Laura Cates Duncan said the commemoration honors those who died but also celebrates the resilience of those who carried on.\n\n“They could have gone elsewhere, but they wanted to stay here,” Duncan said. “Their roots were here.”",

        "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday explicitly linked the actions of Yemen’s Houthi rebels to the group’s main benefactor, Iran, warning Tehran would “suffer the consequences” for further attacks by the group.\n\nThe Pentagon will hold a news briefing at 2:30 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above.\n\nThe comments by Trump on his Truth Social website further escalate his administration’s new campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 53 people this weekend alone and appear poised to continue. Meanwhile, Iran continues to weigh how to respond to a letter Trump sent them last week trying to jump-start negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program.\n\nDescribing the Houthis as “sinister mobsters and thugs,” Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there.”\n\n“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim’ of rogue terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control,” Trump alleged in his post. “They’re dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, ‘Intelligence.'”\n\nIt’s unclear what sparked Trump’s post. However, the head of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sought to separate the Houthis’ actions from those of Tehran this weekend. The Houthis also launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though none reached the ship as it continues flight operations in the region.\n\nIran did not immediately comment on the post.\n\n“Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!” Trump added.",

Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced.”\n\nTrump claimed “a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,” promising to “give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom.”\n\nHe added: “From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nPBS News, in partnership with DPAN, is offering simultaneous translation of our special coverage in American Sign Language. Watch that livestream below.\n\n\n\nThe executive orders are the first step in what Trump is calling “the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense.”\n\nFrigid weather rewrote the pageantry of the day. Trump’s swearing-in was moved indoors to the Capitol Rotunda — the first time that has happened in 40 years — and the inaugural parade was replaced by an event at a downtown arena. Throngs of Trump supporters who descended on the city to watch the inaugural ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol from the National Mall will be left to find somewhere else to view the festivities.\n\nREAD MORE: Your schedule of events for Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nAt the Capitol, Vice President JD Vance was sworn-in first, taking the oath read by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on a bible given to him by his great-grandmother. Trump followed moments after noon, using both a family bible and the one used by President Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration as Chief Justice John Roberts administered his oath.\n\nA cadre of billionaires and tech titans — including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai — were given prominent positions in the Capitol Rotunda, mingling with Trump’s incoming team before the ceremony began. Also there was Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who is expected to lead an effort to slash spending and federal employees.\n\nREAD MORE: 4 things that have changed since Trump’s 1st inauguration\n\nTrump began the day with a prayer service at St. John’s Episcopal Church. He and his wife, Melania, were later greeted at the North Portico of the executive mansion by outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden for the customary tea and coffee reception. It was a stark departure from four years ago, when Trump refused to acknowledge Biden’s victory or attend his inauguration.\n\n“Welcome home,” Biden said to Trump after the president-elect stepped out of the car. The two presidents, who have spent years bitterly criticizing each other, shared a limo on the way to the Capitol.\n\nREAD MORE: How move-in day will work when the Trumps return to the White House\n\nTrump’s inauguration realized a political comeback without precedent in American history. Four years ago, he was voted out of the White House during an economic collapse caused by the deadly COVID-19 pandemic. Trump denied his defeat and tried to cling to power. He directed his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying the election results, sparking a riot that interrupted the country’s tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nBut Trump never lost his grip on the Republican Party and was undeterred by criminal cases and two assassination attempts as he steamrolled rivals and harnessed voters’ exasperation with inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nWATCH: Leaders in tech, AI and cryptocurrency make big donations to Trump inauguration\n\n“I am ready for a new United States,” said Cynde Bost, 63, from Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n\nTrump, in his inaugural address, acknowledged that he was taking office on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which honors the slain civil rights hero. Trump said, “We will strive together to make his dream a reality,” and he thanked Black and Latino voters for their support in November.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Fact-checking Trump’s 2nd inauguration\n\nNow Trump is the first person convicted of a felony — for falsifying business records related to hush money payments — to serve as president. He pledged to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution from the same spot that was overrun by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s said that one of his first acts in office will be to pardon many of those who participated in the riot.\n\nEight years after he first entered the White House as a political newcomer, Trump is far more familiar with the operations of federal government and emboldened to bend it to his vision. Trump wants to bring quick change by curtailing immigration, enacting tariffs on imports and rolling back Democrats’ climate and social initiatives.\n\nHe has also promised retribution against his political opponents and critics, and placed personal loyalty as a prime qualification for appointments to his administration.\n\nWith minutes to go before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive pardons to his siblings and their spouses to shield them from the possibility of prosecution. He said in a statement that his family “has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats” and that he has “no reason to believe these attacks will end.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden took a similar step with current and former government officials who have been the target of Trump’s anger. Biden said “these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.”\n\nTrump has pledged to go further and move faster in enacting his agenda than during his first term, and already the country’s political, business and technology leaders have realigned themselves to accommodate Trump.\n\nDemocrats who once formed a “resistance” are now divided over whether to work with Trump or defy him. Billionaires have lined up to meet with Trump as they acknowledge his unrivaled power in Washington and his ability to wield the levers of government to help or hurt their interests.\n\nLong skeptical of American alliances, Trump’s “America First” foreign policy is being watched warily at home and abroad as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its third year, and a fragile ceasefire appears to be holding in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAlso present will be the head of TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app deemed a national security risk by the U.S. Trump has promised to lift an effective ban on TikTok through one of many executive orders expected to be issued on Monday as the new president attempts to show quick progress.\n\nTrump is planning to swiftly reinstitute his 2020 playbook to crackdown on the southern border — again declaring a national emergency, limiting the number of refugees entering the U.S. and deploying the military. He’s expected to take additional actions — including constitutionally questionable ones — such as attempting to end birthright citizenship automatically bestowed on people born in the U.S.\n\nTrump will also sign an executive order aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs within the federal government. The order will direct federal agencies to coordinate with the White House on identifying and terminating DEI programs. Conservatives have long criticized programs that give preference based on race, gender and sexual orientation, arguing they violate the Constitution.\n\nOthers orders are expected to allow more oil and gas drilling by rolling back Biden-era policies on domestic energy production and rescind Biden’s recent directive on artificial intelligence.\n\nMore changes are planned for the federal workforce. Trump wants to unwind diversity, equity and inclusion programs known as DEI, require employees to come back to the office and lay the groundwork to reduce staff.\n\nWith control of Congress, Republicans are also working alongside the incoming administration on legislation that will further roll back Biden’s policies and institute their own priorities.\n\n— Zeke Miller, Chris Megerian and Michelle L.

        "content": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were barely known outside space circles when they strapped in for what was supposed to be a quick test flight of Boeing’s Starliner capsule last June. Nine months later, they’ve captured the world’s attention — and hearts — as NASA’s stuck astronauts.\n\nThe video of Willmore and Williams’ de-orbit will begin at 4:15 p.m. ET, March 18. Watch in the player above.\n\nTheir homecoming is imminent now that a new crew has arrived at the International Space Station to replace them after launching from Florida last week. They’ll fly back with SpaceX as soon as Tuesday, their problem-plagued Starliner having returned to Earth empty months ago, leaving them behind in orbit.\n\nHere’s a look at “Suni and Butch” and their drama-filled mission:\n\nWho are the stuck astronauts?\n\nThe two test pilots came to NASA via the Navy. Wilmore, 62, played high school and college football in his home state of Tennessee before joining the Navy. Williams, 59, grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, a competitive swimmer and distance runner.\n\nWilmore racked up 663 aircraft carrier landings, while Williams served in combat helicopter squadrons.\n\nNASA picked Williams as an astronaut in 1998 followed by Wilmore in 2000. Each had two spaceflights behind them including monthslong stints at the space station before signing up as Starliner’s first crew.\n\nWhile they accepted their repeated homecoming delays, they noted it was much harder on their families. Wilmore’s wife Deanna has held down the fort, according to her husband. Their oldest daughter is in college and their youngest in her last year of high school.\n\nWilliams’ husband, Mike, a retired federal marshal, has been caring for their two Labrador retrievers. She said her mother is the worrier.\n\nWhat are the stuck astronauts looking forward to on Earth?\n\nBesides reuniting with loved ones, Wilmore, an elder with his Baptist church, can’t wait to get back to face-to-face ministering and smelling fresh-cut grass.\n\nWilmore kept in touch with members of his congregation over the months, taking part in occasional prayer services and calling ailing members via the space station’s internet phone.\n\nWilliams looks forward to long walks with her dogs and an ocean swim.\n\nSeveral other astronauts have spent even longer in space so no special precautions should be needed for these two once they’re back, according to NASA.\n\n“Every astronaut that launches into space, we teach them don’t think about when you’re coming home. Think about how well your mission’s going and if you’re lucky, you might get to stay longer,” NASA’s space operations mission chief and former astronaut Ken Bowersox said last week.\n\nWhy were the stuck astronauts in a political dust-up?\n\nWilmore and Williams found themselves in the middle of a political storm when President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced at the end of January they would accelerate the astronauts’ return and blamed the Biden Administration on keeping them up there too long.\n\nNASA officials stood by their decision to wait for the next scheduled SpaceX flight to bring them home, targeting a February return. But their replacements got held up back on Earth because of battery work on their brand new SpaceX capsule.\n\nSpaceX switched capsules to speed things up, moving up their return by a couple of weeks. The two will come back in the capsule that’s been up there since last fall.\n\n“It’s great to see how much people care about our astronauts,” Bowersox said, describing the pair as “professional, devoted, committed, really outstanding.”\n\nWhy did the stuck astronauts switch space taxis?\n\nAstronauts almost always fly back in the same spacecraft they launched in. Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner and will return in SpaceX’s Dragon.\n\nTheir first flights were aboard NASA’s space shuttle, followed by Russia’s Soyuz capsule. Both the Starliner and Dragon are completely autonomous but capable of manual command if necessary.\n\nAs test pilots, they were in charge of the Starliner. The Dragon had fellow astronaut Nick Hague in command; he launched in it last September with a Russian and two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.\n\nWhat’s the future of Boeing’s Starliner?\n\nStarliner almost didn’t make it to the space station. Soon after the June 5 liftoff, helium leaked and thrusters malfunctioned on the way to the orbiting lab.\n\nNASA and Boeing spent the summer trying to figure out what went wrong and whether the problems would repeat on the flight back, endangering its two test pilots. NASA ultimately decided it was too risky and ordered the capsule back empty in September.\n\nEngineers are still investigating the thruster breakdowns, and it’s unclear when Starliner will fly again — with astronauts or just cargo. NASA went into its commercial crew program wanting two competing U.S. companies for taxi service for redundancy’s sake and stand by that choice.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Nearly 300 Venezuelans are in El Salvador tonight after being deported from the United States without a hearing under a rarely used 18th century law and despite a federal judge's order blocking the move.\n\nThis morning, El Salvador and President Nayib Bukele posted a video on X showing them arriving and being taken into custody. The Trump administration says they're members of a notorious Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua and summarily deported them under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\nThey landed in El Salvador just hours after a federal judge blocked the administration from using that law to deport anyone and ordered any planes that had taken off to turn around. Katherine Yon Ebright is a council at the Brennan Center for Justice. Katherine, what do you make of that? The judge said these planes had to turn around, and clearly they didn't.\n\nKatherine Yon Ebright, Counsel, Brennan Center for Justice: I think that's a real challenge for the rule of law, our system of checks and balances. I do think that part of this is that this is a district court, not a Court of Appeals. And I should hope that as this case progresses, as we move past the temporary restraining order or the judge's order in this case at this time, that the federal government's compliance with the court's orders becomes serious and robust, again consistent with our system of checks and balances.",

Simply put, how big a deal is it for the planet to exceed this 1.5 degree threshold?\n\nMichael Mann, University of Pennsylvania: Well, it's a big deal, but it should be put in context. What happened this year was that we had an El Nino event. It's a natural warming event that adds to the global temperature, so it boosted it temporarily above that 1.5 Celsius mark.\n\nWhat we're really concerned about is when the trend line itself crosses 1.5 Celsius, roughly 3 degrees Fahrenheit. And that'll probably happen in little more than a decade if we continue on this current course. And so I sort of liken it to, you know, here in Philadelphia, where I live, if you get a 50-degree or 60-degree day in late February, it doesn't mean winter's over, but it's an indication that the end of winter is probably coming.

        "content": "KOCANI, North Macedonia (AP) — As families gathered at a hospital for updates, Tomco Stojanov already knew his son’s devastating fate: 25-year-old Andrej died trying to save others in a nightclub fire that left dozens dead in North Macedonia, including many trampled during a desperate bid to escape.\n\n“Thank you for your condolences, but my pain is incurable. The wound is incurable,” Stojanov said, holding up a photograph of his son, clean-shaven and wearing a suit jacket.\n\n“He died while returning and entering to save other people. And he was pushed, run over, that’s how my son died.”\n\nNorth Macedonia is grappling with the loss of dozens of young lives in Sunday’s nightclub inferno in the eastern town of Kocani, and trying to hold those responsible to account and prevent another calamity.\n\nAuthorities were investigating allegations of bribery surrounding the fire in the nightclub, which was crammed with young revelers and at double capacity. Kocani’s mayor resigned Monday over the emerging scandal.\n\nFire tore through the overcrowded Club Pulse during a live concert, leaving 59 people dead and more than 150 injured from burns, smoke inhalation and being trampled in the panicked rush toward the building’s single exit.\n\nVideos showed sparkling pyrotechnics on the stage hitting the club’s ceiling and igniting the blaze as a band played.\n\nBribes to authorities to skip licensing requirements and skirt safety regulations are commonplace in North Macedonia, practices that have caught the attention of Western governments.\n\nThe European Union has repeatedly expressed concerns over pervasive corruption in the country, identifying it as a major obstacle to the country’s accession to the bloc.\n\nSilent protests against corruption were held Monday in Kocani, joined by thousands of residents and separately by university students in Skopje.\n\nREAD MORE: Nightclub fire in North Macedonia leaves at least 59 dead, more than 150 injured\n\n“Justice is expected, that is what we all expect so that there are no such similar situations in the future,” Stavre Janev said at the Kocani protest.\n\nThe protesters’ anger boiled over, with some toppling a van and smashing windows of a storefront — both belonging to one of the club owners.\n\nThe latest in a string of deadly nightclub fires around the world, Sunday’s tragedy shook this nation of 2 million, where close-knit extended family bonds made the disaster personal to many. Clubgoers as young as 16 were among the casualties, and the nation declared seven days of mourning.\n\n“We are all in shock, and I am shocked myself: as a mother, as a person, as a president,” North Macedonian President Gordana Davkova Siljanovska said in an address to the nation Sunday night.\n\nSafety code violations in the club\n\nNorth Macedonia’s government ordered a sweeping three-day inspection to be carried out at all nightclubs and cabarets across the country, starting Monday.\n\nState prosecutor Ljupco Kocevski said a preliminary inspection of the Club Pulse nightclub had revealed numerous safety code violations, including a lack of emergency exits, an insufficient number of fire extinguishers and improper access for emergency vehicles.\n\nThe fire caused the roof of the single-story building to partially collapse, revealing the charred remains of wooden beams and debris.\n\n“The omissions are significant. I can confidently say that this is a failure of the system,” the prosecutor told reporters, also noting the lack of an overhead extinguisher system and fire alarms, and the use of flammable materials to line the inside walls.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Skopje, Interior Minister Panche Toshevski said it appeared the club’s owners paid bribes to former officials to issue a forged license and turn a blind eye to the venue operating far beyond capacity and in violation of fire code. Former economy minister Khreshnik Beteshi was being questioned at a police station in Skopje, his lawyer Elenko Milanov told reporters.\n\nThe country was in mourning as people watched harrowing scenes in the town of 25,000 people, where rescuers for hours carried out the grim task of removing the charred bodies of clubgoers.\n\nA state coroner said the bodies were being brought for identification in batches from morgues due to the high number of people killed.\n\nNeighboring countries provide help\n\nFlags around the country have been lowered to half-staff, and the death toll may rise further, with 20 of the injured in critical condition, Health Minister Arben Taravari said.\n\nNeighboring and nearby countries — Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey — along with a number of others have already accepted some 50 patients with the most serious injuries, while several countries are also sending medical teams to North Macedonia, officials said.\n\n“All patients who have been transferred abroad are currently in stable condition. We hope it stays that way and that we will receive positive news from abroad,” Taravari said.\n\nOfficials said 10 people remain in police custody for questioning in Kocani, some 115 kilometers (72 miles) east of the capital, Skopje. Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski added that a preliminary inspection revealed the club was operating without a proper license. He said the number of people inside the club was at least double its official capacity of 250.\n\nCondolences poured in from leaders around Europe as well as from the office of the hospitalized Pope Francis.\n\nLate Sunday, Kocani’s residents held a candlelight vigil in support of mourning families, waiting in long lines to light church candles.\n\nBeti Delovska, an economist from Skopje, said North Macedonia has never experienced a tragedy like this, with dozens of young people vanishing in minutes. She noted that many young people with bright futures had already left the nation, in search of opportunities elsewhere.\n\nNorth Macedonia “is on its death bed,” Delovska said. “We have no more credible institutions, the health system is completely dismantled, education is poor, judiciary is partisan and corrupt to the bone,” she said.\n\n“I do believe now that only God can save (North) Macedonia.”\n\nTestorides reported from Skopje, North Macedonia",

Fundamentally, I think Schumer's biggest challenge at this moment is that he's fighting the last war. And you could hear it in this interview, which is, he's citing examples from 2006 and 2018, when there was also a trifecta of Republican governors, a governorship, right, a Republican president and Republicans in control of Congress, and that the same strategies that worked then are going to work now.\n\nThe major difference, even with 2017, is that the Republican Party is so much more unified behind Donald Trump, and he is so much more popular in the districts and states where these members come from. So I think his fundamental misreading of the moment, of this just specific moment of this government funding bill was that he thought, as did I think many House Democrats, that the speaker would be unable to keep everybody in line, because, again, in the past, in the last wars, they weren't able to do that, and Johnson only had a one-seat margin.\n\nWell, he did it. And I think that is the theory that they need to be playing now going forward, which is, these Republicans are not going to split away from Donald Trump. And that is hard. And that's to tell your voters that, even if all of our people stick together and all of their people stick together, it's not going to work.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is to hold talks on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin as he looks to get buy-in on a U.S. ceasefire proposal he hopes can create a pathway to ending Russia’s devastating war on Ukraine.\n\nThe White House is expressing optimism that peace is within reach even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remains skeptical that Putin is doing much beyond paying lip service to Trump as Russian forces continue to pound his country.\n\nThe engagement is just the latest turn in dramatically shifting U.S.-Russia relations as Trump made quickly ending the conflict a top priority — even at the expense of straining ties with longtime American allies who want Putin to pay a price for the invasion.\n\n“It’s a bad situation in Russia, and it’s a bad situation in Ukraine,” Trump told reporters on Monday. “What’s happening in Ukraine is not good, but we’re going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace. And I think we’ll be able to do it.”\n\nIn preparation for the Trump-Putin call, White House special envoy Steve Witkoff met last week with Putin in Moscow to discuss the proposal. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had persuaded senior Ukrainian officials during talks in Saudi Arabia to agree to the ceasefire framework.\n\nThe U.S. president said Washington and Moscow have already begun discussing “dividing up certain assets” between Ukraine and Russia as part of a deal to end the conflict.\n\nTrump, who during his campaign pledged to quickly end the war, has at moments boasted of his relationship with Putin and blamed Ukraine for Russia’s unprovoked invasion, all while accusing Zelenskyy of unnecessarily prolonging the biggest land war in Europe since World War II.\n\nPutin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday that Trump and Putin will discuss the war in Ukraine but added that there are also a “large number of questions” regarding normalizing U.S.-Russia relations. The call will take place between 1 p.m. GMT and 3 p.m. GMT (9 a.m. ET to 11 a.m. ET), Peskov said.\n\nTrump has said that control of land and power plants will be part of the conversation, which comes on the anniversary of Russia annexing Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula 11 years ago. That bold land grab by Russia set the stage for Russia to invade its neighbor in 2022.\n\nWATCH: Experts analyze Ukraine ceasefire negotiations and what Putin wants from the U.S.\n\nWitkoff and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested that U.S. and Russian officials have discussed the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant — Europe’s largest — in southern Ukraine.\n\nThe plant has been caught in the crossfire since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in 2022 and seized the facility shortly after. The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly expressed alarm about it, fueling fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe.\n\nThe plant is a significant asset, producing nearly a quarter of Ukraine’s electricity in the year before the war.\n\n“I can say we are on the 10th yard line of peace,” Leavitt said. “And we’ve never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment. And the president, as you know, is determined to get one done.”\n\nBut Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, questioned whether Putin is ready to end the war or will hold out for potential further concessions as Trump grows impatient.\n\nAfter a disastrous Feb. 28 White House meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump temporarily cut off some military intelligence-sharing and aid to Ukraine. It was restored after the Ukrainians last week signed off on the Trump administration’s 30-day ceasefire proposal.\n\n“The U.S. has been consistently offering in some form preemptive concessions that have been weakening the American and Ukrainian negotiating position,” Bowman said. “I think there’s a real danger here that the administration’s approach is boiling down to sticks for Ukraine and carrots for Putin.”\n\nZelensky in his nightly video address on Monday made clear he remains doubtful that Putin is ready for peace.\n\n“Now, almost a week later, it’s clear to everyone in the world — even to those who refused to acknowledge the truth for the past three years — that it is Putin who continues to drag out this war,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nIn his dealings with Zelenskyy and Putin, Trump has frequently focused on who has the leverage. Putin has “the cards” and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly.\n\nTrump, who has long shown admiration for Putin, has also made clear he’d like to see the U.S.-Russia relationship return to a more normal footing.\n\nWATCH: ‘We can’t let Putin declare a win,’ Sen. Warner says of ceasefire talks\n\nThe president during his recent contentious meeting with Zelenskyy grumbled that “Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,” a reference to the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in which he beat Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump on Monday again underscored his view that Ukraine is not in a strong negotiating position. He said Russian forces have “surrounded” Ukrainian troops in Russia’s Kursk region — amplifying an assertion made by Russian officials that’s been disputed by Zelenskyy.\n\nUkraine’s army stunned Russia in August last year by attacking across the border and taking control of an estimated 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of land. But Ukraine’s forces are now in retreat and it has all but lost a valuable bargaining chip, as momentum builds for a ceasefire with Russia.\n\nZelenskyy has acknowledged that the Ukrainians are on their back foot while disputing Russian claims that his troops are encircled in Kursk.\n\nTrump suggested that he’s taken unspecified action that has kept Russia from slaughtering Ukrainian troops in Kursk.\n\n“They’re surrounded by Russian soldiers, and I believe if it wasn’t for me they wouldn’t be here any longer,” Trump said.\n\nLeavitt is one of three Trump administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",

        "content": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Tuesday, killing at least 404 Palestinians, including women and children, according to the territory’s Health Ministry. The surprise bombardment shattered a ceasefire in place since January and threatened to fully reignite the 17-month-old war.\n\nREAD MORE: AP report: U.S. and Israel look to Africa for permanent relocation of Palestinians from Gaza\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes after Hamas refused Israeli demands to change the ceasefire agreement. Officials said the operation was open-ended and was expected to expand. The White House said it had been consulted and voiced support for Israel’s actions.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered people to evacuate eastern Gaza, including much of the northern town of Beit Hanoun and other communities further south, and head toward the center of the territory, indicating that Israel could soon launch renewed ground operations.\n\n“Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” Netanyahu’s office said.\n\nThe attack during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan could signal the full resumption of a war that has already killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction across Gaza. It also raised concerns about the fate of the roughly two dozen Israeli hostages held by Hamas who are believed to still be alive.\n\nA senior Hamas official said Netanyahu’s decision to return to war amounts to a “death sentence” for the remaining hostages. Izzat al-Risheq accused Netanyahu of launching the strikes to try and save his far-right governing coalition and called on mediators to “reveal facts” on who broke the truce. Hamas said at least four senior officials were killed in Tuesday’s strikes.\n\nThere were no reports of any attacks by Hamas several hours after the bombardment, indicating it still hoped to restore the truce.\n\nThe strikes came as Netanyahu comes under mounting domestic pressure, with mass protests planned over his handling of the hostage crisis and his decision to fire the head of Israel’s internal security agency. His latest testimony in a long-running corruption trial was canceled after the strikes.\n\nThe strikes appeared to give Netanyahu a political boost, with a far-right party that had bolted the government over the ceasefire announcing Tuesday that it was rejoining.\n\nThe main group representing families of the captives accused the government of backing out of the ceasefire, saying it “chose to give up on the hostages.”\n\n“We are shocked, angry and terrified by the deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones from the terrible captivity of Hamas,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.\n\nWounded stream into Gaza hospitals\n\nA strike on a home in the southern city of Rafah killed 17 members of one family, according to the European Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included five children, their parents, and another father and his three children.\n\nIn the southern city of Khan Younis, Associated Press reporters saw explosions and plumes of smoke. Ambulances brought wounded people to Nasser Hospital, where patients lay on the floor, some screaming. A young girl cried as her bloody arm was bandaged.\n\nMany Palestinians said they had expected a return to all-out war when talks over the second phase of the ceasefire did not begin as scheduled in early February. The second phase was broadly outlined in the original agreement, but the details had been expected to be hammered out in those talks.\n\nIsrael instead embraced an alternative proposal and cut off all shipments of food, fuel and other aid to the territory’s 2 million Palestinians to try to pressure Hamas to accept it.\n\n“Nobody wants to fight,” Palestinian resident Nidal Alzaanin told the AP by phone from Gaza City. “Everyone is still suffering from the previous months,” he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Humanitarian aid efforts in Gaza slow as hundreds of millions of promised USAID dollars do not arrive\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said at least 404 people were killed in the strikes and more than 560 were wounded after earlier saying that 413 were dead and 660 wounded. Rescuers were still searching the rubble for dead and wounded as the strikes continued.\n\nIt was among the deadliest days of the war, which has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and displaced an estimated 90 percent of Gaza’s population. The territory’s Health Ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead have been women and children.\n\nThe war erupted when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefires or other deals, with Israeli forces rescuing only eight and recovering dozens of bodies.\n\nIsrael responded with one of the most destructive military offensives in recent memory.\n\nThe ceasefire brought some relief to Gaza and allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to what remained of their homes.\n\nU.S. backs Israel and blames Hamas\n\nThe White House sought to blame Hamas for the renewed fighting. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the militant group “could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war.”\n\nAn Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding operation, said Israel was striking Hamas’ military, leaders and infrastructure and planned to expand the operation beyond air attacks. The official accused Hamas of attempting to rebuild and plan new attacks. Hamas militants and security forces quickly returned to the streets in recent weeks after the ceasefire went into effect.\n\nNetanyahu’s office said the Israeli leader held security consultations with senior officials. It did not provide further details.\n\nTalks on a second phase of the ceasefire had stalled\n\nThe strikes came two months after a ceasefire was reached to pause the war. Over six weeks, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as agreed in the first phase.\n\nBut since that phase ended two weeks ago, the sides have not been able to agree on a way forward with a second phase that was meant to free the 24 living hostages still in captivity and bring about an end to the war. Israel says Hamas also holds the remains of 35 captives.\n\nThe second phase was always going to be difficult to negotiate. Hamas has demanded an end to the war and full withdrawal of Israeli troops in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages. Israel says it will not end the war until it destroys Hamas’ governing and military capabilities and frees all hostages — two goals that could be incompatible.\n\nNow Israel has demanded Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to follow the original ceasefire deal reached by the two sides.\n\nREAD MORE: Brushing off Trump’s threat, Hamas says it will only free hostages for a lasting truce\n\nThough Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military says approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas since the ceasefire began, the deal has largely held. Egypt, Qatar and the United States have been trying to mediate the next steps.\n\nA full resumption of the war would allow Netanyahu to avoid the tough trade-offs called for in the second phase of the agreement and the thorny question of who would govern Gaza.\n\nIt would also shore up his coalition, which depends on far-right lawmakers who want to depopulate Gaza and rebuild Jewish settlements there. That was already in motion with the return of far-right Itamar Ben-Gvir and his party to Netanyahu’s government Tuesday.\n\nNetanyahu faces mounting criticism\n\nThe released hostages, some of whom were emaciated, have repeatedly implored the government to press ahead with the ceasefire to return all remaining captives. Tens of thousands of Israelis have taken part in mass protests calling for a ceasefire and return of all hostages.\n\nMass demonstrations are planned later Tuesday and Wednesday following Netanyahu’s announcement this week that he wants to fire the head of Israel’s Shin Bet internal security agency. Critics have lambasted the move as an attempt by Netanyahu to divert blame for his government’s failures in the Oct. 7 attack and handling of the war.\n\nFederman reported from Jerusalem and Magdy from Cairo.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Could it really be true? That of all of college basketball’s urban myths, one of New York’s five boroughs is actually the birthplace of filling out an NCAA Tournament bracket?\n\nBefore all those office pools truly defined March, betting the bracket was the supposed brainchild of an Irish pub owner in Staten Island — a “creative businessman,” his son calls him — whose straightforward idea of plunking down 10 bucks to pick the Final Four teams and the national champion turned the unassuming spot into a bustling attraction where the special of the day could be a million-dollar payout.\n\n“We created a pool that just blew up over time,” current bar owner Terence Haggerty said. “Looking back at it now, how did we pull it off? How did we do it? It was crazy.”\n\nThrough the decades of Larry and Magic, of Jordan and Laettner, through word of mouth and an embarrassment of riches, the contest took off — so much so that the West Brighton neighborhood favorite, Jody’s Club Forest, stakes its claim (though not without at least one other contender to the crown) as the bar that helped ignite the bracket into a billion-dollar business.\n\nHaggerty’s parents, Mary and Jody, opened the club in 1976, and by the next college basketball season, already had hatched the idea of running a college basketball pool to boost business. The rules were simple: Pay $10 to pick only the Final Four teams, the national champ and total points as a tiebreaker in a winner-take-all format. The tournament field of 32 teams — no need to fill a line for every round — was dwarfed by the 88 total entries, with the winner netting $880.\n\nBy the time Jody’s Club shut down the pool in 2006, under scrutiny from everyone from the IRS to Sports Illustrated, the jackpot was a whopping $1.6 million to the winner.\n\n“We never in a million years would have ever imagined where it got,” Terence Haggerty said.\n\nKentucky contender\n\nEvery March needs a Cinderella, and Jody’s Forest Club can punch its ticket as an originator in gambling-related contests.\n\nBut in the home of bourbon, basketball and the Louisville Slugger, could the idea of penciling in a winner for every line have taken its first swing in 1970s Kentucky?\n\nBob Stinson, who died at 68 in 2018, was a U.S. Postal Service worker who applied the idea of using his recreational softball league bracket and the furor over Kentucky Derby betting slips to create his own bracket for the 1978 NCAA Tournament.\n\n“My dad just thought it would be fun to fill out the brackets,” said his son, Damon Stinson. “It was kind of a betting thing but not really. It was kind of a who-knows-college-basketball-better kind of thing.”\n\nStinson said his father used a ruler and unlined paper to sketch out brackets and required only a nominal entry fee. The winner earned more bragging rights than a life-changing bonanza, though that was just fine with Bob Stinson, who traveled around the country for his job and brought brackets with him every March.\n\n“He was proud of it,” Damon Stinson said. “Instead of just watching the games, let’s fill this out. He self-promoted the idea. He was tech savvy back in the day. So when Excel came out, the first thing my dad did was build a tournament bracket off it. This was perfect. He really had the first bracket pool electronically that anybody had, and he emailed it to everybody. That’s how it grew into a much bigger pool and things got out of hand.”\n\nREAD MORE: Women’s college basketball maintains strong TV ratings and attendance this season ahead of March Madness\n\nDamon Stinson says he once almost got thrown out of Catholic school for peddling brackets to other students for $10 each and was caught with $350 and a “bunch of brackets in my backpack.”\n\nTrying to prove the real inventor of the March Madness pool seems as implausible as, well, picking a perfect bracket.\n\nStinson said his father truly believed he made the first one.\n\n“Yes, 100%. Because he traveled for work, nobody had seen what he was doing,” Stinson said. “He traveled a lot nationally around the same time he was coming up with the idea and spreading it. He truly believed. The true 1-64, we’re going to write them down, we’re going to go round-by-round, that literal format is what he started with.”\n\nHoop dreams\n\nThere is not a shred of acknowledgment at Jody’s Club that it was ever a hub for basketball bets. No banner outside, no photos of past winners or framed snapshots of winning tickets. The decor is mostly an homage to Haggerty’s parents, who raised their kids about 12 blocks away.\n\nHaggerty conceded there’s no real proof the bar was the first spot to run an organized pool.\n\n“If somebody said, ‘No, it’s mine,’ go right ahead,” Haggerty said. “Look around here. It’s not something we really promote. It’s not how we were. It’s not how my father was. It’s definitely not how my mother was. If I celebrated that, I wouldn’t feel right doing it.”\n\nHaggerty has no record of ticket winners — not even of the $1.6 million jackpot — but on a recent trip to the pub, a past champion had a barstool seat, a pint and a pining for his share of a six-figure payout won in 2003. Jack Driscoll said he played nearly every year during the life of the pool and recalled the thrill of placing that first bet each March.\n\n“The cutoff day for submitting tickets was as big as any other holiday around here,” he said.\n\nDriscoll struck it big when Syracuse won the national championship. He used the windfall to invest in home improvements, notably a new kitchen.\n\nThe real March Madness at Jody’s Club was figuring out where to stuff piles and piles of cash. No ordinary cash register would hold the hundreds, then thousands, and — twice! — millions wagered in the pool. The family once asked a nun to hold a hefty wad of collections.\n\n“It was sprinkled here, sprinkled there, a little bit of everywhere,” Haggerty said. “Banks. It was hidden in houses at some point. It was quite the operation.”\n\nThe pool was essentially a mom-and-pop business, and it took days in its beginning in an era without fast and reliable computers to enter all the picks. The lines to buy a ticket — firefighters, police officers, elected officials and even Mike and the Mad Dog, Haggerty said — snaked down the street. Haggerty said ticket collection was forced into a neighboring dry cleaner and even other local bars to ease the congestion and give everyone a fair shot at playing.\n\n“It was the best week of the year,” Haggerty said.\n\nEnd of the pool\n\nThe jackpot swelled to about $997,000 in 2004 and topped $1.2 million the following year — again, much like in that first 1977 pool, the entry fee remained $10, cash only — before it stretched to 166,000 entries and a $1.6 million prize in 2006.\n\nThanks in large part to the swelling media attention, the numbers raised a red flag in the federal government. After the winner supposedly claimed the winnings on a tax form, the IRS came knocking on Jody’s Club door. The bar was in the clear for the pool — no one skimmed off the top, and the bar never profited from the seasonal business — but the IRS found Jody Haggerty had underreported his income over three years. Haggerty pleaded guilty to tax-evasion charges, received probation and was forced to pay restitution.\n\nThe charges were the fatal blow to Jody’s slice of March Madness.\n\nEmbarrassed by the notoriety, Jody Haggerty shut down the pool for good ahead of the 2007 tournament. He died in 2016 without another March bet placed in the pub.\n\n“Part of it killed my father, I felt like,” the 42-year-old Terence Haggerty said of the investigation. “My father was really never the same after it.”\n\nEven after his mother’s death in 2019, Haggerty never had any serious thoughts of restarting the pool.\n\n“What we were put through was horrible,” Haggerty said. “But if I did it, I think it would skyrocket right away.”\n\nJody’s Club Forest remains a destination each March for basketball junkies who know of the bars’ role — was it really the first? Does it even matter? — in making betting pools and the art of bracketology an integral part of March Madness.\n\n“We started something that nobody’s come close to since,” Haggerty said.",

        "content": "Ivan Hansen, a retired Danish police officer, loaded up his basket at the supermarket, carefully checking each product to avoid buying anything made in the United States. No more Coca-Cola, no more California Zinfandel wine or almonds.\n\nThe 67-year-old said it’s the only way he knows to protest U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies. He’s furious about Trump’s threat to seize the Danish territory of Greenland, but it’s not just that. There are also the threats to take control of the Panama Canal and Gaza. And Trump’s relationship with Elon Musk, who has far-right ties and made what many interpreted as a straight-armed Nazi salute.\n\nOn his recent shopping trip, Hansen returned home with dates from Iran. It shocked him to realize that he now perceives the United States as a greater threat than Iran.\n\n“Trump really looks like a bully who tries in every way to intimidate, threaten others to get his way,” he told The Associated Press. “I will fight against that kind of thing.”\n\nA growing boycott movement across Europe\n\nHansen is just one supporter of a growing movement across Europe and Canada to boycott U.S. products. People are joining Facebook groups where they exchange ideas about how to avoid U.S. products and find alternatives. Feelings are especially strong across the Nordic region — and very possibly strongest in Denmark given Trump’s threats to seize Greenland.\n\nGoogle trends showed a spike in searches for the term “Boycott USA,” and “Boycott America,” as Trump announced new tariffs, with the top regions including Denmark, Canada and France. At the same time, a global backslash is also building against Tesla as the brand becomes tied to Trump, with plunging sales in Europe and Canada. In Germany, police were investigating after four Teslas were set on fire Friday.\n\nElsebeth Pedersen, who lives in Faaborg on the Danish island of Funen, just bought a car and made a point of not even looking at U.S.-made options.\n\n“Before Elon Musk started to act like a maniac a Tesla could have been an option. And maybe a Ford,” she said.\n\nFrench entrepreneur Romain Roy said his solar panel firm has bought a new Tesla fleet each year since 2021 but canceled its order for another 15 to take a stand against Musk’s and Trump’s policies.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘We don’t want to be Americans’ or Danes, Greenland’s winning party leader says\n\nDescribing the United States as “a country closing in on itself,” he cited Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and Musk’s arm gestures. He said he was instead buying European models, even though it would cost an additional 150,000 euros ($164,000).\n\n“Individual consumers, society, our countries, Europe must react,” he told broadcaster Sud Radio.\n\nResponding to consumer demand, Denmark’s largest supermarket chain, the Salling Group, created a star-shaped label this month to mark European-made goods sold in its stores. CEO Anders Hagh said it’s not a boycott, but a response to consumers demanding a way to easily avoid American products.\n\n“Our stores will continue to have brands on the shelves from all over the world, and it will always be up to customers to choose. The new label is only an additional service for customers who want to buy goods with European labels,” he said in a LinkedIn post.\n\n‘I have never seen Danes so upset’\n\nFor Bo Albertus, “when Trump went on television and said he would by political force or military force take a piece of the Danish kingdom, it was just too much for me.”\n\nThe 57-year-old said he felt powerless and had to do something. He has given up Pepsi, Colgate toothpaste, Heinz ketchup and California wine, and replaced them with European products.\n\nHe is now an administrator of the Danish Facebook page “Boykot varer fra USA” (Boycott goods from the U.S.), which has swelled to over 80,000 members.\n\n“Drink more champagne,” one user posted after Trump threatened 200% tariffs on EU wine and Champagne.\n\nAlbertus, a school principal, told the AP he really misses the strong taste of Colgate. But he’s been pleasantly surprised at finding a cola replacement that is half the price of Pepsi.\n\nTrump’s policies have “brought the Danish Viking blood boiling,” said Jens Olsen, an electrician and carpenter. He is now considering replacing $10,000 worth of U.S.-made DeWalt power tools even though it will cost him a lot.\n\nHe has already found European replacements for an American popcorn brand and California-made Lagunitas IPA beer, which he calls “the best in the world.”\n\n“I’ve visited the brewery several times, but now I don’t buy it anymore,” he said. He has mixed feelings because he is a dual Danish-U.S. citizen, and has spent a lot of time in the United States. But he can’t contain his anger.\n\n“I’m 66 years old and I have never seen the Danes so upset before,” he said.\n\nMichael Ramgil Stæhr has canceled a fall trip to the U.S. and is among many choosing to buy Danish instead of American-made, though he cannot pinpoint the exact moment he made the decision.\n\n“Maybe it was when (Trump) announced to the world press that he intended to ‘take’ Greenland and the Panama Canal, and if necessary by military force. That and the gangster-like behavior towards the Ukrainian president in the White House,” the 53-year-old Copenhagen resident said.\n\n“The man is deadly dangerous and is already costing lives” in the developing world and Ukraine, added Stæhr, who works helping disabled war veterans, many of whom got injured serving alongside U.S. troops in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. He himself served in Bosnia.\n\nRising anger in France, too\n\nEdouard Roussez, a farmer from northern France, launched an online group, “Boycott USA, Buy French and European!” that in just two weeks has attracted over 20,000 members on Facebook.\n\nRoussez believes a boycott of U.S. companies is a good way to express opposition to Trump’s policies, especially “the commercial and ideological war” he believes Trump is waging against Europe.\n\n“First of all, these are the companies that financed Donald Trump’s campaign,” he said on state-owned LCP television channel. “I’m thinking of Airbnb, I’m thinking of Uber, I’m thinking of Tesla of course.”\n\nThe irony of it all? The group is on Facebook. Roussez said only the American online social media platform could give him the reach he needed. But he is working to migrate the group to other platforms with no U.S. funding or capital.\n\nSome choices are harder than others\n\nSome are also including U.S. services like Netflix in their boycotts.\n\nSimon Madsen, 54, who lives in the central Danish city of Horsens with his wife and 13-year-old twins, says the family has given up Pringles, Oreos and Pepsi Max. Not so hard, really.\n\nBut now they’re discussing doing without Netflix, and that is a step too far for the kids.\n\nHe also wonders whether he should keep buying Danish-made Anthon Berg chocolate marzipan bars, which are made with American almonds.\n\nIt’s important, he said, for people to use the power of the purse to pressure companies to change.\n\n“It’s the only weapon we’ve got,” he said.\n\nAP writers Stefanie Dazio in Berlin, John Leicester and Samuel Petrequin in Paris, and Laurie Kellman in London contributed.",

He said Ashley Biden has 13 agents assigned to her detail and that she too “will be taken off the list.”\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the former president’s office.\n\nFormer presidents and their spouses receive life-long Secret Service protection under federal law, but the protection afforded to their immediate families over the age of 16 ends when they leave office. But outgoing presidents can extend protection for those who might otherwise not be eligible for up to six months after they leave office, something Biden did for his children and Trump did for his family after leaving office in 2021. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush also extended protection for their families for a period.\n\n“We are aware of the President’s decision to terminate protection for Hunter and Ashley Biden,” the agency said in a statement. “The Secret Service will comply and is actively working with the protective details and the White House to ensure compliance as soon as possible.”\n\nWhile touring the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Monday afternoon, a reporter asked Trump if he would revoke the protection for the former president’s son.\n\n“Well, we have done that with many. I would say if there are 18 with Hunter Biden, that will be something I’ll look at this afternoon,” Trump said, who added this was the first time he heard about the matter.\n\n“I’m going to take a look at that,” he said.",

        "content": "(Optional Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nSometimes, and more often these days, the headline says it all. From Reuters:\n\nNASA terminates chief scientist role...\n\nWhy should NASA, of all places, have the luxury of a chief scientist? Is that waste or fraud or abuse?\n\nNASA’s acting administrator Janet Petro told employees by email on Monday the Office of the Chief Scientist, the Office of Science, Policy, and Strategy, and the diversity, equity and inclusion branch within the Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity would be closed. The email was seen by Reuters.\n\nMany of NASA’s 18,000 employees have been anxious over the Trump administration efforts to trim back the federal bureaucracy, which have been spearheaded by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, has contracts worth roughly $15 billion with NASA, according to federal contracting data.\n\nActually, were I seeking to eliminate waste in the NASA budget, I might examine the $15 billion parceled out to a company that’s been regularly raining debris all over the Caribbean, but that’s just me.\n\nPetro said in the email that NASA had been actively working with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to implement Trump’s January executive order directing government agencies to reduce and reorganize their workforce. NASA’s policy, diversity and science offices are the latest space-focused units in the U.S. to be affected by Trump and Musk’s government efficiency agenda.\n\nIt is important—and very sad—to note that the current chief scientist, Katherine Calvin, is a prominent climatologist who has contributed to several United Nations reports on the climate crisis, and last month Calvin and several other delegates were denied permission to attend a climate conference in China. And this reminds us that the administration is laying off 1,100 people at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But this administration has wished the climate crisis out into the Phantom Zone, so I’m sure none of this will matter.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Another rough couple of days for the administration in the nation’s courts. On Tuesday, an appeals court upheld common sense, always a losing issue for this bunch. This comes after a judge in another court told the DOGE and Pony Show to, well, pony up, because he said so, that’s why.\n\nOne of the most audacious acts of this administration is the president’s delusion that he can simply sign away the 14th Amendment’s plain guarantee of birthright citizenship with a stroke of his mighty pen. (Why do they laugh at his mighty pen?) However, Judge David Barron of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was having none of it. He points out that the administration’s crack legal team didn’t even address this fundamental issue in its brief.\n\nThe Government expressly declines to make any developed argument that it is likely to succeed on appeal in showing that the Executive Order is either constitutional or compliant with 8 U.S.C. § 1401. Nor does the Government contest that, for more than a century, persons in the two categories that the Executive Order seeks to prevent from being recognized as United States citizens have been so recognized. Instead, the Government contends that it can make the requisite showing for a stay of the preliminary injunction even without developing an argument to us that the Executive Order is lawful and even though the enforcement of the Executive Order would dramatically break with the Executive Branch’s longstanding legal position and thereby disrupt longstanding governmental practices.\n\nMeanwhile, another judge, District Judge Christopher Cooper, has told DOGE to open its books so we can all know what the hell is going on. From Politico:\n\nU.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper said the vast and “unprecedented” authority of DOGE, formally known as the U.S. Digital Service, combined with its “unusual secrecy” warrant the urgent release of its internal documents under the Freedom of Information Act. ... “The authority exercised by USDS across the federal government and the dramatic cuts it has apparently made with no congressional input appear to be unprecedented,” Cooper wrote in a 37-page opinion.\n\n“The rapid pace of [DOGE’s] actions, in turn, requires the quick release of information about its structure and activities,” Cooper wrote. “That is especially so given the secrecy with which DOGE has operated.” Cooper leaned heavily on news reports suggesting that Musk’s operation had led to the firing of tens of thousands of government employees, the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, a government-wide deferred resignation program and widespread access to sensitive government databases for relative outsiders.\n\nThis is how, in all legal propriety, you call something a rogue agency and tell it to stand and deliver the reasons why it should continue to operate as one.\n\n“Congress needs the requested information in a timely fashion to use it effectively. The electorate also requires the expeditious production and publication of this information,” Cooper said. “Voters may seek to influence congressional representatives to take action responsive to USDS at any point along the road. And ‘[t]he dissemination of information’ sought by CREW would contribute ‘to an informed electorate capable of developing knowledgeable opinions and sharing those knowledgeable opinions with their elected leaders.’ ”\n\nIt’s becoming quite plain that the president’s hail of executive orders is little more than a rain of shadows. Most of them are so deeply unserious that the only people taking them as anything more than empty gestures are the members of the president’s cult in Congress and some of the more credulous members of the media. Once again, the real crunch will come when he runs out of appeals and tries to ignore the final judgments of the courts. That will be the true reckoning.",

        "content": "The Secretary of Health and Human Services, a noted roadside taxidermist, gave an interview to Fox News on the subject of the current measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico. His explanations were ... unconventional. From :\n\nHe issued a muffled call for vaccinations in the affected community, but said the choice was a personal one. He suggested that measles vaccine injuries were more common than known, contrary to extensive research. He asserted that natural immunity to measles, gained through infection, somehow also protected against cancer and heart disease, a claim not supported by research. He cheered on questionable treatments like cod liver oil, and said that local doctors had achieved “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries with steroids or antibiotics.\n\nCod-liver oil? Is this guy possessed by the restless spirit of my grandmother? Why not Father John’s Medicine? Or Carter’s Little Liver Pills? Or even one of those old cough remedies that advertised the benefits of heroin. Wait, forget I said that.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Kennedy appeared frustrated that a vaccine-preventable illness rather than chronic disease had drawn national attention during his first weeks as secretary. “We’ve had two measles deaths in 20 years in this country—we have 100,000 autism diagnoses every year,” he said. “We need to keep our eye on the ball. Chronic disease is our enemy.” The suggestion that vaccines cause autism has been discredited by dozens of scientific studies.\n\n\n\nAsked whether he opposed so-called measles parties—events that parents hold to purposely spread measles from a sick child to healthy children—Mr. Kennedy said he would “never advise someone to get sick.” But he also praised the benefits of natural immunity, protection gained after becoming infected with a virus, claiming that it lasted longer than vaccine-induced immunity and may later protect against cancers and cardiac disease.\n\nThe secretary suggested that we all consult “frontline doctors,” who, he said, were getting great results from various unconventional nostrums “on the ground.” On the ground in Gaines County, Texas, epicenter of the outbreak, however, the frontline doctors seem to be asking him not to help quite so much.\n\nMr. Kennedy’s focus on unverified treatments has frustrated some doctors in Gaines County, who have been trying to explain to patients that there is no antiviral for measles and that they have little control over which patients suffer serious symptoms. “We already are dealing with people that think measles is not a big deal,” said Dr. Leila Myrick, a family medicine doctor in Seminole, Texas, who has been caring for patients with measles for several weeks. “Now they’re going to think they can get this miracle treatment and that they definitely don’t need to get vaccinated. It’s 100 percent going to make it harder.”\n\nAnd, in the Beyond, Hippocrates gets out of the business.",

        "title": "Shall We See How the President’s Brilliant Trade War Strategies Are Affecting the Folks?",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done, and where they sing “Amazing Grace” all the way to the Swiss bank.\n\nLet’s take a brief look around the country to see how the president’s brilliant trade-war strategies are affecting the Folks. From CNBC:\n\nCaleb Ragland, a soybean farmer in Magnolia, Ky., voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024. Now, however, he has to navigate a tariff minefield at a time when the sector is already facing major headwinds. … As pressures mount in the industry as a result of tariffs imposed by the second Trump administration—as well as retaliatory levies from other countries—he’s worried about the longevity of his business. “My sons potentially could be the 10th generation if they’re able to farm,” Ragland, who is also the president of the American Soybean Association, told CNBC. “And when you have policies that are completely out of our control—that they manipulate our prices 20%, 30%, and on the flip side, our costs go up–we won’t be able to stay in business.” This isn’t the first time farmers have had to deal with new tariffs. Back in Trump’s first term, the trade war with China in 2018—a time when Ragland said the agricultural economy was “in a much better place than it is right now”—cost the U.S. agriculture industry more than $27 billion, and soybeans made up virtually 71% of annualized losses.\n\nI would point out that Mr. Ragland works in an market that got brained by the president’s trade policies in 2018, the last time the president was in office. And yet he voted for him twice since then. I have given up trying to understand this way of thinking. If you can’t rely on simple self-interest as an explanation for voting patterns, then political science might as well be alchemy or necromancy.\n\nIf the trade war has a front line, it probably runs through places like Point Roberts in Washington State. From Global News:\n\nPoint Roberts is a community of about 1,100 people and it is located just south of Tsawwassen. However, it relies on British Columbia for much of its commerce. “Half of us here are dual citizens, including me—Canadian and American, half of us,” Point Roberts resident Brian Calder and former president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce told Global News. “So there’s 500 of us here that have very strong ties to Canada. And I get that they’re upset and angry that their sovereignty is being threatened for no good reason whatsoever. And the animosity and the apprehension, the anger is very, very detrimental to Point Roberts. They stay away.”\n\n“It’s absolutely devastating for Point Roberts businesses, those that are left because we lost half our businesses in the COVID 20 months lockdown, they couldn’t carry themselves through that long period of time,” Calder said. “And of those left, now, they’re just barely hanging on.”\n\nNone of this, of course, is necessary. It is all so much gratuitous negligence. This is the first international conflict playing out completely in the deteriorating mind of an American president. Which doesn’t mean there are no casualties.\n\nCalder said Point Roberts residents consider British Columbians and Canadians brothers and sisters, not just neighbors. “We didn’t do anything wrong. They didn’t do anything wrong. Why are we in this mess? It’s absolutely stupid and it’s not productive and it’s not necessary or needed. And no one wins.” Calder said tensions are high on both sides of the border but some residents have expressed that they are facing hostility when they cross into Canada, which is part of the reason for the bumper sticker. \"We’ve had people actually try and push people over in traffic,” he said. “We’ve had people confronted down at the drug store in Tsawwassen. ‘What are you doing here? Get back to your own (country)’. We don’t have a drug store.”\n\nWe move along to Utah, which was a pioneer in adopting mail-in voting and which remained a reliably conservative state anyway. Now, however, out of what appears to be pure spite, the state legislature seems determined to blow up that proud history. From Bolts:\n\nLannie Chapman, the county clerk who runs this office and serves as the top elections official in Utah’s most populous county, eyed the artifact and considered how different, and difficult, her work would be if the state ever went back to voting the way it did when the old booth was in use. “No, thank you,” she said at the prospect, laughing. “It’s fun for a photo op, but that’s about it.”\n\nThe hypothetical may be a bit too close for comfort. A few miles up the road from Chapman’s Salt Lake City office, at the Utah State Capitol, lawmakers have just put the finishing touches on a major voting-system overhaul: House Bill 300, which passed the Republican-controlled legislature March 6, would end universal vote-by-mail in Utah. It’s a landmark reform that would close an era in which Utah occupied a unique place in the national patchwork of election rules: Since 2019, it’s been the only reliably red state in the country to automatically mail a ballot to every registered voter. HB 300 would instead require any Utah voter to proactively request a mail ballot. It would also impose additional restrictions on how they must return these ballots, for instance by ending the grace period for when they must be delivered to election offices by postal workers. “We are known for safe, secure, and convenient access, and this is going to make everything a lot more difficult,” Chapman said. “It’s not fair to our voters.”\n\nThis is simply conservative fanaticism run amok. Voting officials in Utah from both parties swear by the current vote-by-mail system, and the people seem to like it a great deal. But as Bolts learned, the people carrying the water for these changes are doing so for people far from the Beehive State.\n\nBolts put the question to state Representative Jefferson Burton, the Republican lawmaker who championed the bill. Burton conceded that the audit found no widespread fraud in Utah, and that vote-by-mail has increased turnout. But he cited an “Election Integrity Scorecard” by the Heritage Foundation, the influential national conservative think tank that published Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for Donald Trump’s second term. The scorecard ranks Utah 33rd among all states and the District of Columbia, docking Utah significantly for its policies on voter ID and absentee balloting. Burton said he expects that HB 300 will vault Utah into the list’s top 10, and made clear that he tailored his bill to that aim. “They [Heritage] think it should be a conscious decision for a voter to opt in to vote by mail,” he said. The lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action, has endorsed Burton’s bill.\n\nVivisecting a successful election system in Utah in order to gain brownie points with a right-wing intellectual chop shop in Washington is quite cultlike.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Cod-Soaker Friedman of the Algarve brings us a tale of bad chemistry. From News4 in Oklahoma City:\n\nLane Garrett and his family bought their land along the banks of the Cimarron River 16 years ago. “It’s real quiet out here,” Garrett said. “There’s lots of wildlife out here—turkey, quail, deer. There’s a river right over there.” The property sits at the very edge of Logan County, far from the noise and pollution of city life. “Very few people get to look out their kitchen window and see a river,” Garrett said.\n\nSounds idyllic. What could go wrong in paradise?\n\nThat’s why he and his family were frustrated when, in June 2024, they learned a pipeline would be running through their land. Phillips 66 went through the courts to condemn part of the family’s land, securing an easement to build the oil pipeline.\n\nOh, that could go wrong.\n\nConstruction began in January. “They bored underneath the river, and then it came up there on that north bank,” Garrett said. But with the work came a mess. “Just trash, you know, pop cans, chip cans,” Garrett said. “Cigarette butts, things like that.” Then, his brother, William, smelled something near the crew’s boring machine. “I was like, What? What is that? I know that smell, and I know it’s not good. What is that?” William Garrett said. “And then finally looked down and just a pool of hydraulic fluid.” Hydraulic fluid—and a lot of it—was seeping into their pasture. “I would say a good 20 feet to the north, you’d find it on the mud, little drops of where hydraulic fluid had just been sprayed in kind of a west-out direction,” Lane Garrett said.\n\nAfter first denying the whole thing, Phillips 66, the extraction beast that owned the pipeline, assured the Garretts that the hydraulic fluid had been cleaned up. They made a big show of doing so, even though the Garretts thought all the company was doing was “pushing dirt around.” When the cleanup was finally done, Garrett drilled a borehole into the area that allegedly had been cleaned. You can probably guess what they found.\n\n“You can see all that goopiness, all that hydraulic fluid,” William Garrett said. Sure enough, it was all still there—and thanks to recent rains—now heavily soaked into the groundwater all over their pasture, just yards away from the Cimarron River. Land—that the Garretts rely on. “I cut hay, bale hay, and then feed it, you know, to my neighbor’s cattle,” Lane Garrett said. It was supposed to be his family’s quiet paradise, away from the pollution.\n\n“It’s land that I put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into,” Lane Garrett said. But now, he says it’s land—he just can’t trust. “Now, rather than having chemicals just sitting on top of my pasture, now I’ve got a ball of chemicals, you know, five, six feet down underground in there, and that’s all going to kill everything above it,” Garrett said. “I just—I wanted all that stuff cleaned up. You know, I wish that, you know, the guys on the site, that they would have just been upfront, said, hey, look, there was an accident. This is what happened.”\n\nPipelines leak, and the companies that own them lie. That’s all ye know and all ye need to know.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.\n\n\n\n",

Emanuel, operative-turned-politician-turned-diplomat told me before adding his stock line since returning from serving as ambassador to Japan. “I’m not done with public service and I’m hoping public service is not done with me.”\n\nI’m telling you, Tiger Beat on the Potomac’s Jonathan Martin is positively aglow at the thought of this boorish triangulator back in the spotlight. In the immortal words of the late Mr. Zappa—“Oooh, gooey, dripping, steaming!”\n\nSince coming home in January from his stint in Tokyo—a job he repurposed to be American envoy to all of Asia—Emanuel has been as visible as any other Democrat. Never mind that he currently holds no office and hasn’t been on a ballot for a decade. Name the political podcast and Emanuel has likely been on it or will be shortly. He immediately snagged a CNN contract and regular Washington Post column, no small accomplishment for a former official at a moment of retrenchment for news organizations. He’s also hitting the lecture circuit, appearing for paid and gratis gigs before audiences such as the Realtors and the Chicago Economic Club. Emanuel is pointedly avoiding Ivy League campuses and later this month will make his first stop on a service academy tour when he speaks at West Point. Just as striking is to talk to anybody in high-level Democratic politics who knows Emanuel—which is to say most everyone—and hear how matter of fact they are about the inevitability of his candidacy.\n\nI cannot think of another Democrat more unsuited to the current political moment than Rahm Fcking Emanuel, whose only real political gift is alienating members of his party’s political base. He is now recasting himself as the man with all the grown-up concerns. He’s following the recent trail blazed by Gavin Newsom, except that, unlike Newsom, Emanuel isn’t directly attacking a segment of the trans community. He’s asking the Democrats to blow past the issue entirely, and it’s making Jonathan Martin positively giddy.\n\n“I am done with the discussion of locker rooms, I am done with the discussion of bathrooms and we better start having a conversation about the classroom,” Emanuel said, drawing applause as he alluded to a new study showing more than two-thirds of eighth graders can’t read at grade level. He kept coming back to the study and eventually and explicitly tied the policy to the politics, in Rahm’ian fashion.\n\nOoooh, he has his own adjective now. Do go on.\n\nShortly after his trip to Washington, Emanuel dashed out to Los Angeles to appear on Bill Maher’s show, where he went even further for a less sober audience. “In seventh grade, if I had known I could’ve said the word ‘they’ and gotten in the girls’ bathroom, I would’ve done it,” he said. “We literally are a superpower, we’re facing off against China with 1.4 billion people and two-thirds of our children can’t read eighth grade level.”\n\nThere it all was, in two appearances. Emanuel’s gift for finding a towering issue hidden in plain view; his tactical skills for grasping the political benefits it could confer, delivered with a snappy sound bite to elevate statistics off the page; linking domestic policy to geopolitics and sending a message about another, more controversial topic; and not merely urging Democrats to move on from trans youth issues, but using them as a vehicle to shift the conversation to ground he, and most in his party, would prefer to fight on. Gavin, are you listening?\n\nChristmighty, get a room, will you?\n\nFor the record, Emanuel's history with public education is...how you say?...spotty. As mayor of Chicago, he went to war with the city's teachers and their unions. In 2012, 26,000 members walked out in protest of stalled negotiations on a new contract. The strike went on for seven days despite Emanuel's failed attempt to get a court to order the teachers back to work, and the teachers cleaned his clock. The strike was so successful that it is credited with a revival of unionism in America generally, and with breaking the bipartisan consensus on education \"reform,\" particularly in the area of standardized testing, which has lost a great deal of its allure.\n\nIn fact, Emanuel's tenure as mayor of Chicago unquestionably will be the focus of all the oppo should he actually run for president, and the most fruitful area of research will be Emanuel's relationship to the renegade Chicago Police Department. (How renegade? The Guardian revealed that the CPD was running what essentially was a black site in an old warehouse.) It was his pattern to deflect and stonewall on police accountability until cornered by the weight of public outcry and/or the power of a federal investigation. At which point, Emanuel would make a great show of getting \"out in front\" of the issue. The classic case was the police murder of 17-year old Laquan McDonald in 2014. From Bloomberg:\n\nBy the time of the 2015 deaths of Freddie Gray in Baltimore and Sandra Bland in Texas—both of whom died under questionable circumstances while in police custody—the BLM cause was ascendant. And nowhere did a collision between BLM and the police seem more inevitable at that point than in Chicago, where evidence of decades of police corruption and brutality concerning Black and Latino civilians was surfacing, and it was beyond refutation.\n\n\n\nThis was the political climate that greeted Emanuel as he started his second term as mayor in mid-2015, and he could have gotten in front of the policing issue before a clash happened. Instead, just months into that term, he antagonized both sides. At an October 2015 White House gathering of law enforcement officials, Emanuel said Chicago police officers had gone “fetal”—that they were shrinking back in their public safety duties because of social media-driven backlash to police brutality, or out of fear they’d get caught on live-streaming services doing something shady. In that one statement, he scapegoated police reform activists and infantilized the police force.\n\nThis, I guess, is what Politico would call Emanuel’s tactical skills for grasping political benefits.\n\nI guess that’s what Politico would call Rahm’ian fashion. And then I, for one, will throw up.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "I get the feeling that the sooner that trial in the Manhattan courthouse goes to jury, the better for us all, because it seems to me that, here in the homestretch, the entire exercise is in danger of going to the zoo and never returning. Inside the courtroom, defense attorney Todd Blanche has led Michael Cohen through all the shenanigans in which he engaged on the former president*’s behalf in an attempt to delegitimize everything Cohen has done since flipping on his former boss, apparently in the belief that nobody outside the courthouse has ever a seen a legal drama in which somebody “turns state’s.”\n\n\n\nOutside, in a desperate attempt to keep the public’s interest, the TV coverage is starting to slide toward the notion that Blanche has been brilliant in his cross-examination of Cohen. Meanwhile, someone released a series of penis-shaped balloons with the names and faces of various Trump antagonists attached to them. In addition, Thursday’s emissaries from the cult’s Washington outpost included Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, and Anna Paulina Luna in what can fairly be called the D-Team. At least nine of them were there and, as The Hill shrewdly pointed out, this completely banjaxed the GOP’s wafer-thin majority in the House.\n\nThe trip to New York comes on what was scheduled to be a busy day in particular for the House Oversight Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Both had scheduled morning hearings for a top GOP priority: holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress.\n\n\n\nA source confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that the last-minute shift in the Oversight schedule was to allow the lawmakers to make the trip to New York. Trekking to Trump’s trial means Gaetz and Biggs will miss the Judiciary hearing on the matter, while Oversight members such as Boebert and Luna may be back for the hearing that has since been moved to 8 p.m. EDT. “Due to member schedule conflicts, the markup is now starting at a different time to accommodate members’ schedules,” a spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee told The Hill on Wednesday.\n\nAny late return could also complicate other matters for House Republicans. The chamber is voting at 4 p.m. on a bill to reverse Biden’s hold on certain transfers of arms to Israel. The White House has said Biden would veto the bill. A number of Democrats had signaled some support for the measure, but Democratic leaders are now whipping against it. As a result, heavy absences by Republicans could make it difficult for GOP leaders to get it across the finish line.\n\nNaturally, the business of governing the nation must give way to their obligation to go to New York to pay homage to their God-Emperor Schitzinpants. The difference between the members of Thursday’s congressional pilgrimage and the clutch of penis-shaped balloons that took flight not far from them isn’t vast.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "On Thursday, the House of Representatives censured Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) for interrupting the president’s farrago of lies and fantasies the other night. Speaker Moses was really puffed up, especially when Democrats in the chamber began singing “We Shall Overcome,” and he had to pound his gavel to try and get them to stop. (Narrator: They didn’t.) Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, both of whom greeted former president Biden’s State of the Union like a matched set of howler monkeys, voted to censure Green without blinking, as did Rep. Joe Wilson, whose lasting fame is yelling, “You lie!” at President Obama. These were shameful turns of events, but they were nothing compared with the spectacular dive taken by the Democratic congressional elite.\n\nThe buggering out began in the Senate. CNN reported that Senate Democrats were disappointed by Green’s protest. That was a kind of signal to the House Democratic caucus that it was okay to hit the silk on one of its own. From CNN:\n\nHouse Minority Leader Jeffries told CNN earlier Wednesday that the “overwhelming majority” of Democrats approached the speech with seriousness. When asked about Republicans wanting to censure Green and whether that’s appropriate, Jeffries said only: “I haven’t had that conversation with anyone.“ Democrats do not plan to whip members against the censure resolution, allowing lawmakers to vote how they want, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nRemind me to cancel Jeffries’s reservation in my foxhole. Yeesh.\n\nUltimately, ten Democrats voted with the Republicans. They were:\n\nAmi Bera of California Ed Case of Hawaii Jim Costa of California Laura Gillen of New York Jim Himes of Connecticut Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania Marcy Kaptur of Ohio Jared Moskowitz of Florida Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington Tom Suozzi of New York\n\nHimes and Kaptur are genuine disappointments, and what a show pony Moskowitz has turned out to be. Himes compounded his surrender by giving to CNN this knives-to-a-gunfight explanation.\n\n“I don’t mind being one of 10 Democrats who said, no, there’s a deeper principle at stake here, which is reverence for this institution,” Himes said after the vote, adding that lawmakers need to act “with the decorum and with the civility that says to the world that we are a serious country. I have no love for Donald Trump, but I do have reverence for the Office of the President,” he told CNN’s Pamela Brown.\n\nI think a proper axiom for the moment is to treat the presidency with the exact amount of reverence for the office displayed by its current occupant. Which is to say as an ATM at a roadside rest stop in the Mojave. And for the benefit of readers not familiar with the Classics, decorum is an ancient Latin word for “chickenshit.”\n\nFor himself, God bless him, Green remains unbowed. It was he who began the singing in the chamber that so aggravated Speaker Moses. I was about to make a joke about preaching to the choir, but I realized that wasn’t so funny anymore.\n\n\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Optional Video Accompaniment to This Post)\n\nNow that we’re in a full-fledged trade war with Canada, of all places, I believe we are at a profound disadvantage, because Canadians understand how tariffs work and the president of the United States does not now know how they work and likely never will. From CTV:\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford says Trump’s tariffs will have devastating impacts on the U.S. auto manufacturing sector, suggesting that assembly lines could “shut down” in the United States within a week. Ford made the comments during an interview with CNN on Tuesday morning. “We are going to continue seeing, in the U.S., plants close, assembly lines shut down. In the auto sector, they may last five maybe eights days,” the premier said. “This is unnecessary and we do have to retaliate and I apologize to the American people. It is not you. It is your president that is causing this problem.” ... Ford tells The Wall Street Journal that the province will slap a 25 per cent export tax on the electricity it provides to 1.5 million homes and businesses in New York, Michigan and Minnesota. Ford also told the newspaper that he will direct energy producers in Ontario to stop exports to the U.S. entirely if President Donald Trump follows through on a threat of implementing more tariffs as of April 2.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau addressed the nation on Tuesday morning and, showing an understanding of how tariffs actually work, explained that Canada is unimpressed with the political salience of our president’s abject ignorance. From CTV:\n\nToday, the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they’re talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense. Canadians are reasonable and we are polite, but we will not back down from a fight. Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. tariffs are withdrawn and not a moment sooner. I want to speak first directly to the American people: We don’t want this. We want to work with you, as a friend and ally. And we don’t want to see you hurt, either. But your government has chosen to do this to you.\n\nDonald, in the over eight years you and I have worked together, we’ve done big things. We signed a historic deal that has created record jobs and growth in both of our countries. We’ve done big things together on the world stage. And now, we should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity.\n\nIn this, Trudeau is referencing the deal cut during the president’s first term in office, which the president declared at the time to be the greatest bargain struck since Napoleon sold President Jefferson the entire Big 12 Conference back in 1803. This was a deft turning of the knife. In response, the president reached deeply into his bag of incoherence. From the Hill:\n\nTrump said Monday that “vast amounts of fentanyl got poured into our country” mostly through Mexico and from China and suggested car manufacturers build factories in the U.S. to successfully sidestep the levies. “So, what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the United States, in which case, they have no tariffs.\"\n\nInterestingly, given this country’s dependence on Canadian timber, the president on Monday announced that he would be opening up huge portions of the country’s national forests for timber harvesting, completely ignoring existing regulations regarding the preservation of endangered species because ignoring his duty to see that the laws are faithfully executed is about his only real skill. From The Guardian:\n\nTrump has instructed the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to increase logging targets and for officials to circumvent the US’s Endangered Species Act by using unspecified emergency powers to ignore protections placed upon vulnerable creatures’ habitats.\n\n\n\nThe order also stipulates logging projects can be sped up if they are for purported wildfire risk reduction, via “thinning” of vegetation that could ignite. Some scientists have said that aggressively felling forests, particularly established, fire-resistant trees, actually increases the risk of fast-moving fires. “This Trump executive order is the most blatant attempt in American history by a president to hand over federal public lands to the logging industry,” said Chad Hanson, wildfire scientist at the John Muir Project. “What’s worse, the executive order is built on a lie, as Trump falsely claims that more logging will curb wildfires and protect communities, while the overwhelming weight of evidence shows exactly the opposite.”\n\nSo far, the tariffs have not touched Canadian lumber imports, but the handwriting is pretty much carved into the trunks. The president has ordered an “investigation” into whether lumber imports from Canada are endangering our national security. From The New York Times:\n\nThe president has also initiated national security investigations into steel, aluminum and copper, but those metals are directly used by the military to make planes, ships and weaponry. Asked about the national security justification, the White House official said that the military was a major consumer of lumber.\n\nTo paraphrase Jim Hightower, if lumber is necessary to our national security, I want the logging rights to the president’s head.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Not that it will matter to anyone except the farmers in California, and then not until this summer when things get hot and dry, but the administration’s release of a massive amount of water on January 30 was almost altogether a photo op. At the time, more than a few people noticed that the release of the water, ostensibly to help quench the epic wildfires that had been raging in and around Altadena and Pacific Palisades, wasn’t doing any good.\n\nCol. Chad W. Caldwell, commander of the Army Corps’ Sacramento district, wrote that the water that poured out of Lake Kaweah and Success Lake “could not be delivered to Southern California directly.” To do so would have required several steps of coordination with state and federal agencies to transport the water to a rarely used connection point, and it quickly became clear that was impossible in such little time, according to the memo.\n\nThe release was done to satisfy Trump’s executive order, Caldwell wrote. And the colonel had also been asked to send photos of the water to Washington, according to an official familiar with the request who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Trump posted a photo of water flowing from Lake Kaweah on X the next day.\n\nThere is something so ridiculous and clumsy about this scheme—and it says so much about the childish irresponsibility of the administration—that it’s easy to lose sight of what a destructive episode this likely will turn out to be. Two reservoirs vital to the Central Valley’s growing season have been prematurely drained.\n\n... the episode, a week and a half into Trump’s second term, drew criticism from farmers and officials from both parties in the Central Valley. It also angered many California water officials, who charge that the Trump administration squandered local water supplies in a part of the state where every drop counts, to score quick political points.\n\n“This was completely unprecedented,” said one water official in California who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe concerns about the federal government’s approach. Even though the Los Angeles fires were declared contained soon after the release began, Trump celebrated what he called the “beautiful water flow that I just opened in California ... I only wish they listened to me six years ago,” Trump wrote on X on Jan. 31. “There would have been no fire!”\n\nThat’s pretty much where we all are these days—drowning on the wrong side of the mountains to do any good.",

        "content": "I was going to avoid commenting on the automobile ad cut on the White House grounds on Tuesday starring the president of the United States, his principal policy advisor, and the kid. I was going to give it a good leaving alone because I thought it was so self-evidently tacky and inappropriate as to beggar description. I mean, seriously, what’s next? The Tostitos Department of State?\n\nIt was established long before he got into politics that El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago was the reigning king of garish excess. Every one of his buildings was a gilded palace of sins against good taste. Years back, there was some talk about his buying the New England Patriots, and I distinctly remember writing a column for the Boston Herald in which I speculated that he was likely to build a waterfall into what was then Sullivan Stadium and probably add a white grand piano to one end zone. (Truth be told, the Pats were so bad in those days that any distraction would have been welcome.) And as evidenced by the fact that his wife tore up Jacqueline Kennedy’s rose garden and turned the East Wing into\n\ninto the set of a David Lynch movie for Christmas during his first term, his taste has not been refined very much.\n\nBut this spectacle on Tuesday, with Elon Musk standing there like Beelzebub in a ball cap, was envelope pushing taken to its extreme. “You want the future to look like the future,” Musk explained. “What kind of truck would Blade Runner drive?” Being a replicant himself, Musk has a natural interest in the answer to that question. But the president is just a terrible pitchman. He’s as desperate as one of those guys from Glengarry Glen Ross, talking fast, bragging about his great “imagination,” and apparently sending semaphore with his hands while waving around some promotional material Musk had provided him.\n\n“It’s like a golf cart that goes really fast,” Musk burbled as the president climbed into the driver’s seat.\n\nExcept, of course, sometimes they blow up, and sometimes they sink, and sometimes you have to walk through crowds of people who think Elon Musk really is Beelzebub in a ball cap just to get a test drive that you hope will not blow up or sink. It’s the new Golden Age, folks. Act today. Operators are standing by,",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nDonald Trump won the 2020 election,” Steve Bannon pronounces. “Of that there is not even a question.\"\n\nObviously you expect me not to agree with you, I say. “Of course I expect you not to agree with me,” he says. “And I’m also not looking for you to agree with me. And I also don’t give a fuck who in the mainstream media agrees or disagrees with me.”\n\nAnd so off we go—about this and about Covid (the Bannon view: “It’s 100 percent a bioweapon—fucking not even a question”) and about vaccines (“I would never in ten million years get this vaccine,” Bannon says, and asks if I would; I simply hand him my vax card, which he looks at with apparent amazement: “I’ve never . . .”) and about what I view—but naturally Bannon doesn’t—as his incessant anti-Semitic dog-whistling. At one point, he rhapsodizes about the range of information available to people these days.\n\nOr misinformation, I say.\n\n“A wide range of information,” he counters. “One man’s misinformation may be somebody else’s Holy Grail, right?”\n\nI hardly agree—this seems a terrifying equivalence to me—but he’s already on to something else.\n\nWe are sitting out back of a home Bannon has near Tucson on the last day of July. The conversation is interrupted by a call on his cell. Here, for the record, is how Bannon says hello: “What the fuck don’t you understand about one o’clock?” The caller is Peter Navarro, who worked in the White House on economic issues throughout the Trump administration. Navarro went missing for this morning’s prerecorded episode of Bannon’s mouthpiece TV show and podcast, War Room, when Bannon was expecting him to pick apart Ron DeSantis’s new speech on economic policy. Bannon’s soon making nice but, as he often does, led with the loud.\n\nCall over, he’s soon back in the flow. When I ask him what he wants people to think of him, he offers up the manifesto of a valiant, tireless warrior.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Asked about the potential for history to judge him wrong about everything, Bannon said, “That will be impossible.”\n\n“I don’t care,” he replies. “Whatever they think. You’ve got so much time in this vale of tears, right, to use your agency. And you’ve got to be able to look in the mirror every day and just say, I’m leaving it all on the field, and I’m nonstop, all that. And whatever they think, they think. Remember, as much as I’m hated by—and/or dismissed by—the mainstream media or the Left, I’m much more hated and dismissed by the Republican establishment. Hated. Hated. So I don’t care. History is going to be the judge. Remember, over time history judges things very differently. There are people today that are heroes that were looked at as goats. I mean, look at Oppenheimer. It changes over time. So I think you just got to do what you have to do and let the cards fall where they may. I can look at the results. I can see what’s happening. I see how we’re changing American political history. We’re ascending. We’re getting bigger.”\n\nAnd what if history decides you were wrong about everything?\n\n“That will be impossible.”\n\nWe continue this back-and-forth, which somehow seems both necessary and futile, for more than three hours, then take a break for the day. As for what happens later that evening, how you choose to interpret it may depend on how you feel about science and meteorology and the vagaries of energy flow; on how you feel about chance and numbers and the random play of improbable events; on how you feel about the existence or nonexistence of God and His interventionist tendencies; on how you feel about fate and symbols and auguries. And, of course, on how you feel about coincidences.\n\nThese, anyway, are the facts:\n\nBannon goes to bed early. Around eight o’clock in the evening, he is awoken by what sounds like an explosion. (“Dude, I’m telling you, we thought the house had blown up. I’ve never had, even on my Navy ship—I’ve never been that direct a hit.”) Right outside the front door of Bannon’s house, just to the left as you enter—and precisely above War Room’s makeshift Arizona studio—stands a date palm, maybe forty feet high. A lightning bolt had hit the palm’s trunk, just above the height of the roof, and flames are now climbing both upward to the fronds and down the trunk.\n\n“That entire beautiful palm was literally lit up like a torch,” Bannon tells me. “It was raining fire.”\n\n\n\nOne problem with hating pretty much everything Steve Bannon says and everything he stands for is that it might be exactly what he wants. “I hope they say I’m a devil,” he’ll tell me. “I hope they say I’m a fucking demon. I could give a fuck less. All I want to do is win.” Another is that maybe such dilemmas are a distraction, masking more crucial questions. For instance: Is Bannon truly someone forever playing the game several levels above and ahead of the rest of us, his every ambiguous zig and zag calculated to further a majestic master plan? Or is he actually just one more big-talking huckster, brazenly improvising whatever he can with whichever tools he can muster, making it all up as he goes? Or—maybe the most chastening possibility of all—might it be that in our modern-day runaway world of increasingly fractured and divided truths, there’s no longer a meaningful difference between the two?\n\nBannon’s past offers contradictory clues. He launched himself into most people’s consciousness as the unkempt, take-no-prisoners agitator who took over Donald Trump’s faltering presidential campaign in August 2016. After Trump defied most predictions by winning the election that November and Bannon was appointed chief strategist in the White House, a notorious Time magazine cover story suggested that Bannon might be the second-most-powerful man in the world. The implication was that Bannon—“the great manipulator,” as Time’s cover line proclaimed him—was pulling the strings of the first. Six months later, in circumstances that remain disputed, Bannon was gone. Since then, he has hovered hazily in the middle distance. Looked at through one lens, he is the radical Right’s great ideologue, propagandist, and strategist, orchestrating both overtly and covertly a global agenda that is currently focused on bringing Donald Trump back to the White House before fundamentally reordering American society. Looked at through another, that’s exactly what he needs people to think as he wages the endless uphill battle for relevance and influence.\n\nWhatever he is, he’s not lazy. War Room typically broadcasts live twenty-two hours a week, preaching a version of America crafted to horrify anyone not swept along with its relentless presentation of a country at the precipice’s edge, time running out unless enough good people inform themselves of the truths being hidden from them, then organize themselves to resist. To an outsider’s ears, it is not just the supposed truths, and the cavalcade of what are presented as supporting facts, that can seem at best unfamiliar, at worst poisonously inaccurate. This is a world with a whole disorientating language of its own. Here—to get a sense of both the substance and cadence of this upside-down world—is a selective glossary:\n\nThe Keebler Elves: Bannon’s disdainful collective term for the other candidates running against Donald Trump for the Republican nomination. Bannon, as an all-in Trump advocate, agitates against what he depicts as a pointless competition, a needlessly divisive distraction, and a waste of resources given that, in his way of seeing, the end result is already inevitable.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Bannon often embraces harsh criticisms—that he’s “a cancer,” for example, or that he has no conscience—as a kind of proof of purpose.\n\nThe Biden crime family: It is an article of faith in this world not just that Hunter Biden’s international business relationships embodied an extensive, calculated corruption and criminality, one that has been systematically covered up by the Democratic and judicial establishments, but also that President Biden and other members of his family knowingly participated in, and received large sums of money from, these relationships, and that the president is consequently compromised in his dealings with sundry foreign powers.\n\nJudas Pence: Another inviolable article of faith in this world is that the 2020 election was stolen. For those who believe this, pretty much everything that ensued was part of a valiant fight for truth, a fight in which they were betrayed on January 6, 2021, by Vice President Pence’s supposed failure to prevent the certification of the 2020 vote.\n\nLawfare: A further article of faith is that all of the current legal proceedings against Donald Trump are coordinated charges that have been concocted to prevent his return to power, and that in this the judiciary is controlled and steered by the Democratic establishment in what amounts to an act of warfare by putatively legal means, i.e., lawfare.\n\nThe Uniparty: Bannon expresses as much, if not more, disdain and hate for the Republican establishment as for Democrats. In his vision, the two share so many common interests in the status quo that they resist in lockstep the kinds of radical changes Bannon believes are needed, effectively operating in the shadows as a single united party (an idea, Bannon points out, once explored in the writings of Gore Vidal).\n\nTV for stupid people: Bannon’s routine term for his hated Fox News, which he considers “an insidious cancer inside the conservative movement.”\n\n“No coincidences”: A phrase regularly invoked in reference to a sign in Bannon’s Washington studio that reads, “There are NO conspiracies, but there are NO coincidences. Stephen K. Bannon”—a convenient rhetorical back door to what often seems exactly like conspiratorial thinking.\n\nThe sunlit uplands: The term Bannon often throws out—generally, as with all these terms, without explanation—to denote a happier place we will eventually find ourselves at the end of the necessary turmoil he aims to instigate. The phrase is borrowed from a famous speech given by Winston Churchill in 1940 to inspire the British people in their fight against Hitler.\n\nThat is the sound of War Room. There are often, however, soft words about one particular subject. “We’re getting the best Trump right now,” Bannon told his audience this morning. “I can tell you, having had the honor and privilege of working with the president since 2016, when you meet, when you see him now in private, this is the best Trump we’ve ever had: on point, focused, on fire, take-no-prisoners, understands exactly what the task and purpose is.”\n\nLater, Bannon and I retire once more to his Arizona back patio for further conversation. A fountain burbles behind us; hummingbirds flit around. Lizards skitter across the ground. At one point a hawk flies by. “They keep the rats away,” he says, “so God bless them.” He continues where he left off on the show: “Here’s why I tell people, donors and all these guys. I said, You’re missing the point. You may hate Trump. You’re stuck with Trump. There’s nobody, while Trump’s breathing, that they’ll vote for.”\n\n\n\nEngaging in discourse with—and writing about—someone like Steve Bannon presents a peculiar challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, in The Atlantic magazine, Jennifer Senior wrote an extensive and compelling profile that forensically unpicked the ways she saw Bannon “attempting to insert a lit bomb into the mouth of American democracy.” Senior referred to his “industrial-grade bullshit” and “straight up megalomania” and to his War Room show as “a mighty river of ordure.” In her story, a chorus of former colleagues fingered Bannon as “a con man” and “a cancer,” someone who “stumbled into the MAGA movement as a way to make money and to get fame and fortune” and who “may well be mentally unstable, in a frightening, disturbing kind of way,” even someone who could be legitimately compared—“we have seen his sinister form before”—to Hitler. Though the article also respectfully strained to convey something of the world as Bannon sees it, I presume that most Atlantic readers consumed it as a devastating takedown.\n\nThough, as it turns out, not all of them.\n\n“I thought that was terrific,” Bannon tells me. “I thought it was a great piece.”\n\nIt’s hard not to let it get into your head, this imperviousness. It’s not just that Bannon seems impervious to the most obvious lines of attack; it’s that he seems to relish and feed off them. Here is CNN’s Jake Tapper speaking of this world: “And where do people like that go to share the big lie? MAGA media. . . . I wish, I wish in my soul, that any of these people had a conscience.” And why am I so familiar with this quote? Because it is part of the montage that begins every episode of War Room, a montage that is generally followed by fresh media snippets from the previous twenty-four hours, frequently showcasing full-on, pointed—and often, to my ears, effective—mainstream eviscerations of the latest events and tendencies in what we might call Bannon-Trump world. You might expect the targets of such critiques to ignore or sidestep them; instead, Bannon leans into them, as though he considers them testimonials, as proofs of purpose. For instance, one day in August he’ll play a long clip from Morning Joe of Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski taking apart the duplicitous logic of the Right, culminating in Scarborough saying, “They know it’s a lie. They really do. They know it’s a lie. They know the game they’re playing. . . . They can never just say, ‘It’s wrong that he stole nuclear secrets and no president or former president has ever done that in American history.’ ‘It’s wrong that he tried to overthrow a presidential election.’ ” And then the broadcast cuts to a clearly delighted Bannon, smirking. “This was a gem,” he tells his audience. “They’re just in full meltdown.” The front Bannon presents, whether as astute tactics or bluff, is: Agree with us and we fly. Attack us, deride us, scorn us, demean us and we soar.\n\nThis article appeared in the Winter 2023 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nNot long after Bannon left the White House, he was contacted by the documentarian Errol Morris. Back in 2003, Bannon had attended the American premiere of The Fog of War, Morris’s artful (and Oscar-winning) interrogation of Robert McNamara’s role in the debacles of the Vietnam War, at the Telluride Film Festival. “It’s one of the things that motivated me to really want to be, eventually, a documentary director,” says Bannon. (One of the many strands of Bannon’s earlier career—sometimes depicted as a triumphant restless visionary journey through a dazzling array of disciplines, sometimes as a textbook example of how a man who talks the right kind of game can keep failing upward—is his role as the maker of ambitious proselytizing right-wing documentaries.) “The nonlinear way he told the story just blew me away. Plus the fact that McNamara still didn’t quite get it, right?” Later, Bannon saw The Unknown Known, Morris’s 2013 film about Donald Rumsfeld: “I thought that was a disaster for Rumsfeld. I thought it exposed all the things that people had thought about him, of how he’s so certain on stuff—just like McNamara—and it’d get you in these horrible situations, right?” As Bannon remembers it, Morris now proposed making a film about Bannon that would be the third in this series, and Bannon’s response was this: “I said, Look, Robert McNamara and Rumsfeld, those guys are world historical figures. I’m some schmendrick that ran a little news site”—before taking over the Trump campaign in 2016, Bannon had been in charge of the right-leaning website Breitbart News—“and I spent a couple months at the White House. There’s no film there. And he goes: Let me determine that.”\n\nOn the surface, the strangest thing about Bannon’s account of this film’s genesis is his apparent lack of worry about being the third panel of a triptych, slotted in alongside Morris’s coruscating portrayals of McNamara and Rumsfeld. The resultant film, American Dharma, was anchored around excerpts from fifteen or so hours of Morris interviewing Bannon. “I made the movie ultimately because I was interested in Steve Bannon—or, if you like, the nature of Steve Bannon’s evil,” Morris tells me. “I’ve always been interested in difficult characters, in morally compromised characters, and Bannon didn’t seem to me in any way outside of that interest.” To its maker, it was perfectly clear what the movie showed. “American Dharma, properly considered, is a warning,” Morris says.\n\nBannon’s reaction to the film will, by now, come as little shock. “I thought it was fantastic,” he tells me. “If you look at Rumsfeld and McNamara, you come out and understand how they got us into these debacles and still don’t understand what they did. Well, I think there’s no doubt in that film Stephen K. Bannon fully understands exactly what he has helped wrought and is quite comfortable taking 100 percent accountability for that.”\n\nPerhaps more surprising—and perhaps a bellwether of the increasingly intolerant ways in which storytelling around divisive and controversial subjects is nowadays judged—was how many commentators saw American Dharma as sympathetic to Bannon, and unacceptably so. For whatever it was worth, in the interviews Morris gave to promote the film he allowed less room for doubt, talking of “Bannon’s sadism” and “almost diabolical destructiveness,” his “smokescreen of bullshit” and “world of real nastiness.” Morris warned that Bannon “is not a moron but he is a cynical bastard, and no one, absolutely no one, should turn their back on him” and noted that he might be “one of the most dangerous men in the world.”\n\nBannon tells me that he considers these last two observations compliments.\n\nThe morning after the lightning strike, Bannon stands outside his house, surveying the damage, alongside a man who has come to work out what should be done about it. The fire department arrived last night in about six minutes, extinguishing the flames, but the top half of the trunk is blackened and embers litter the ground. The palm tree, Bannon is told, is dead and must be removed. Bannon asks whether they can replace it with one of the same height.\n\n“Maybe a little bit shorter?” the man proposes. Bannon seems disheartened by this suggestion. The man points out that, in time, the new tree will grow.\n\n“Okay,” says Bannon, “but how long does it take to grow that high? I won’t be around that long.”\n\nBrent Stirton/Contour Photos/Getty Images Bannon was in the orbit of the January 6, 2021, insurrection—he spoke with former president Trump that morning and evening—but he hasn’t elaborated on his involvement.\n\nWhen we return to the back patio—the temperature will peak at 102 today, but Bannon is in his usual two collared shirts over a T-shirt—we further discuss Donald Trump. From the outside, his alliance with Trump has sometimes looked less than straightforward. Bannon concedes that he was not an easy fit with what was required in his abbreviated time in the White House. “Look, I’m incredibly headstrong, I got that,” he says. “And I want you to be a partner if you kind of agree with where we ought to go.” Immediately after his departure, he and his former boss remained in contact—when Bannon gave a high-profile interview about his experiences to 60 Minutes, Trump called him and was, says Bannon, “very positive.” A schism became apparent a few months later, in January 2018, when Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury, an intimate account of the Trump presidency’s early days, was published. Bannon appeared to be a key source, and his views of Trump and others around him were not always flattering. Trump put out a statement denouncing Bannon—“when he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind”—then followed up with a tweet referring to “Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!”\n\n“That’s a great line,” says Bannon when I cite the “cried when he got fired” sentence. “It’s a great line. I’ve got an older brother, so I know how people say things. I think if you asked President Trump today, he would say that was quite an exaggeration.”\n\nDid you cry?\n\n“No. God no. I resigned. I wasn’t fired. I resigned.”\n\nBannon argues that he has always been a loyalist. He points out that after January 6, 2021, most people peeled away, assuming that the Trump era had come to an end, but Bannon never did: “I had a lot of people call me, say, ‘It’s over, and you’re a smart guy, and you can help drive this into a positive way.’ I said, ‘That’s not a positive way. You’re just surrendering. I’m never going to stop. You scratch me and you just get a hardheaded mick.’ ” (Bannon often refers to his Irish family heritage in this way, usually in the context of resilience, hotheadedness, and stubbornness.) “ ‘It’s just the way I’m built. And we’re not going to stop. And I can see, if we hold, that Trump’s going to return to the White House.’ People fucking laughed at my face.”\n\nTwo and a half years later, with Trump the presumptive Republican nominee, that laughter has subsided. And as for his actual relationship with Trump now, Bannon says this: “I don’t want to talk about the specific conversations, but we speak pretty frequently, yeah. . . . It’s normally about what’s happening on the show and the clips and the poll numbers and what’s happening at the rallies.”\n\nGiven those words, and also bearing in mind the impression of personal intimacy with Trump I’ve heard Bannon convey to his War Room audience, what I will now relate might be taken as evidence of just how strange and unconventional the deep bond running between Trump and Bannon is. Though it could also, if you are so minded, be used to question its nature, or even its very existence.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Bannon filmed a live episode of War Room from the library of Mar-a-Lago, a special to promote the vainglorious new coffee-table book Letters to Trump. The broadcast began with Bannon speaking with the book’s publisher, Sergio Gor. About fifteen minutes in, well ahead of the agreed schedule, Trump appeared off camera and greeted Bannon. “He starts smiling: ‘My Steve!’ ” Bannon recounts. The show cut to an ad break, and when it returned, Trump was in the interviewee seat, answering Bannon’s questions.\n\nAll very unremarkable, you might think, except for one astonishing aspect: By Bannon’s own account, this moment was the first time he and Trump had met in the flesh since Bannon left the White House in August 2017, almost six years earlier.\n\nBannon fills me in on how things proceeded that day. How afterward Trump invited him to stay for dinner, and though at first Bannon demurred, Trump insisted. And how they were then joined by Melania. Bannon describes the ensuing reintroductions: “He goes, ‘Steve . . . Melania.’ I go, ‘First Lady, so great to see you again. Haven’t seen you in a long time.’ She goes, ‘I always liked you, Steve.’ And I go, ‘I know, Melania, you and I, we hate the same people.’ And she laughed. A very knowing laughter.”\n\nI ask Bannon whether he wants to give me a list, assuming he’ll sidestep, but he doesn’t entirely.\n\n“Listen,” he says, “it’s no doubt we had some hard feelings with Jared and Ivanka and others. . . .”\n\nAt dinner, he says, they all talked, and sitting there at the table, Trump DJed from his iPad.\n\n“He knows Melania hates it when he’s DJing,” Bannon notes.\n\nThere has since been a second meeting between Bannon and Trump, on July 19, before a screening of the movie The Sound of Freedom at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Bannon says that he spoke with Trump for about twenty minutes beforehand and also had a long conversion with Jared Kushner, one he presents as a rapprochement.\n\nOne day, we go on an outing. The many twists of Steve Bannon’s early career have been well-documented but are nonetheless littered with curiosities, and the site of one of these lies a half hour or so north of where we are. Biosphere 2 was completed in 1991, a self-contained, domed system of different environments in which a group of people would be enclosed for extended periods of time and studied as they tried to subsist. At the time, what seemed like a weird futuristic experiment was an object of intense media coverage and some controversy, and in 1993 an investment banker was brought in to rationalize parts of the operation. This was Steve Bannon, who ended up running the project for about two years, along with a team including his younger brother Chris.\n\nChris is still involved, and today the three of us are heading up there. Steve has lost his glasses, so Chris drives. In the front, they talk about sharing a bedroom in their home in Richmond when they were young and reminisce about the local band they loved to see all the time, Steel Mill—“played at my high school, at the prom,” says Bannon. Steel Mill being Bruce Springsteen’s band before he had a recording contract. (This tracks. In his autobiography, Born to Run, Springsteen describes how Richmond became Steel Mill’s second home, where they built up a following and even “got hired for school events.” It was, Springsteen wrote, “one of the two places where we could make a buck.”) And then Bannon’s off, talking about seeing the Dead in ’73 and New Riders of the Purple Sage. On the Biosphere 2 property, before Chris Bannon gives me a tour (the Biosphere itself, part research site, part tourist attraction, is now run by the University of Arizona), we first go to the ranch house where Steve Bannon lived for two years in the 1990s—without, as he notes, air conditioning—and continue our conversations. I’ve told Bannon I want to talk to him about Michael Wolff’s books. Over a series of publications—2018’s Fire and Fury, 2019’s Siege, 2021’s Too Famous (and, to a lesser degree, 2021’s Landslide)—Wolff could be seen as the great chronicler of Steve Bannon, though perhaps not always of the man Bannon would now wish people to see.\n\nThe discussion gets puzzling right from the start. When I ask Bannon when he first met Wolff, his response is “After I left the White House? I don’t remember.” When I press that Wolff was clearly around him before that, Bannon offers a second, very specific date—that it was when Wolff and Kellyanne Conway did an onstage interview about the first hundred days of the Trump administration, which was on April 12, 2017. This perplexes me, but for now I decide not to challenge him further on it. Likewise, when I read Bannon a summary Wolff has written of their interactions—“We logged hundreds of hours of conversation together in Trump Tower, the White House, the frat-style accommodations he occupied on Capitol Hill, the luxury suites he favored when he was in New York, during a trip to Europe we took together, and over dinners at my house in Greenwich Village”—Bannon says, “Ridiculous,” adding, “I have ex-wives I haven’t spent hundreds of hours with.” (Bannon has been married three times—his eldest daughter, Maureen, works mostly behind the scenes at War Room—but says that these days he has no ongoing romantic relationship. “I’ve directed my chakras in a different direction,” he says. “I’ll be seventy shortly. I got a window here to have an impact.” In this regard, he mentions something that I can’t get out of my head. He tells me that even years ago, when he’d interview people for his own firm, his second or third question would be about their personal life. He says that it didn’t matter what they actually said: If they spoke for more than sixty seconds in response, they wouldn’t be hired.)\n\nAs Bannon tells me that he has read none of Wolff’s books, I quote to him some relevant passages. I do so less in the expectation that the 2023 version of Bannon is likely to reaffirm the opinions that Wolff reports he once had and shared, more in trying to understand how his present role and his relationship with Trump may—or may not—transcend this material. For instance, there’s this passage from Siege: “But Bannon also believed that if you could get around Trump’s repellent character, intellectual deficiencies, and glaring mental health issues, you ought to be able to see that Trump was being savaged—with the powers that be trying to run him out of office—for doing much of what he had been elected to do. Trumpism, in fact, was working.”\n\n“I haven’t heard these,” Bannon responds, “and I think the reason that you haven’t heard these is that people realize it’s nonsense. It’s just Wolff trying to sell books. Is anybody out there in the media right now, anybody out there in the Republican staff, anybody out there, either lovers of Trump or haters of Trump, that don’t understand that I am Trump’s closest ally?”\n\nJared Siskin // Getty Images Author Michael Wolff has written extensively about Trump. When Bannon appeared to be a key source in Wolff’s 2018 book Fire and Fury, about the early days of the Trump presidency, Trump took to calling his former advisor “Sloppy Steve Bannon.”\n\nAt one point, as I read him a series of further examples of how Bannon was said to have, as Wolff summarized in 2021, “conducted a riotously entertaining monologue about Trump and his family’s stupidity, avarice, incompetence, and corruption,” Bannon protests that if all this were true, “Why would Trump and I be this close today?” Which is, indeed, in all kinds of ways, the question.\n\nThe most explicitly damning material comes from the later books, but it was Fire and Fury that drew Trump’s “Sloppy Steve” pushback and so whose contents Trump presumably has some knowledge of. One passage—which I also read back to Bannon—strikes me as particularly relevant, again not so much for what it says about Trump’s capabilities (a debate that has its own life out in the world) but for how Trump might feel about someone who has questioned them like this: “Steve Bannon was telling people he thought there was a 33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term. In any event, there would certainly not be a second term, or even an attempt at one. ‘He’s not going to make it,’ said Bannon at the Breitbart Embassy. ‘He’s lost his stuff.’ ”\n\n\n\n“No,” Bannon tells me. “I don’t remember saying that.”\n\nI mention other sources I’ve come across that seem to echo, and attribute to Bannon, something of the same idea. One is a quote I read in an interview with the 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen, promoting a book he had written, referring to how Bannon had told him about Trump showing signs of early-stage dementia and raising the genuine possibility that because of this, Trump might be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Nonsense,” says Bannon when I relay what Rosen said. “Total nonsense. And I’ve never talked to Rosen, ever, except for the 60 Minutes interview, ever.” Bannon further argues that for that 60 Minutes interview, he had agreed to answer questions on anything—if he had said this to the show’s producer, why didn’t they ask about it in the interview? “No, I certainly never had that opinion. I don’t ever remember expressing it. President Trump—look how sharp he is today. I don’t remember anybody ever questioning his ability to perform the office.”\n\nI ask him how he feels, if so, about a story like this being out there.\n\n“It’s irrelevant. Nobody talks about it. Trump knows it’s bullshit. I didn’t even know he’d written a book. Have you heard anybody talk about that? Listen, I sell books—just the mention of Bannon and you can make whatever. . . . This is why, if I had to chase down every . . . remember, I’m an anti-Semite, I’m a white nationalist . . .”\n\nAnd, for now, we talk of other things.\n\nWhatever Bannon did or didn’t once say about him, his proximity to Trump and his ideas has certainly had marked legal consequences. Bannon was somewhere in the orbit of the events of January 6, 2021. He was part of strategic Washington hotel discussions in the days before and spoke to Trump both in the morning and evening of January 6, but beyond that he has refused to clarify much further. Whether out of abstract principle or contrariness or because he had secrets he didn’t want to tell, Bannon refused to comply with a subpoena to testify before the select committee investigating January 6. He was subsequently charged with contempt of Congress, found guilty, and sentenced to four months in prison, a verdict he is appealing.\n\nBrandon Bell Bannon at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2022. He routinely fosters the notion among his followers that he is close with former president Trump.\n\nThat is not the only legal peril he has been facing. In August 2020, Bannon was one of four men accused of diverting funds from a nonprofit, We Build the Wall, established to raise money for the private construction of barriers on the U. S.–Mexico border. If Bannon expected support from a president neck-deep in reelection maneuverings, none was forthcoming. “I didn’t like that project,” said Trump when the news of Bannon’s arrest broke. “I thought that was a project that was being done for showboating reasons.” (Bannon blames others for this: “That’s what Jared had told him. . . . Knowing the facts as he knows them now, he’s, I think, very supportive.”) Bannon’s three codefendants are now in jail. And Bannon? On Trump’s final day in office, he was pardoned.\n\nI ask Bannon how he got the pardon.\n\n“I have no idea,” he avers. “It was just him.”\n\nYou must have advocated for it.\n\n“No, never.”\n\nReally?\n\n“No. Never advocated.” Bannon adds that he believes Rudy Giuliani may have brought it up “of his own volition.”\n\nBut you must have been pleased for it to happen?\n\n“Sure. Definitely. There’s no doubt about that. I think that’s President Trump. I think he can think these things through.”\n\nWhy do you think he did it?\n\n“I think he did it because he knows I’m an honest guy.”\n\nNot that the whole affair is behind him. In September 2022, Bannon was indicted on state charges, which are unaffected by a presidential pardon, related to the same events. He claims to be unworried. “I have no doubt I’ll be exonerated at trial,” he says. “I never took one penny from this.” Likewise, when it comes to the four-month sentence he already faces, he professes to be “100 percent confident” that he will never serve any time. He talks about all these legal matters as though they’re just bothersome, minor paperwork errors that will be corrected in due course. It’s hard to determine how much of this is smart strategic thinking and clearheaded analysis, how much is unanchored self-belief, and how much is pure bluff.\n\n\n\nThose things Bannon told me in Arizona, when pushing back against people who had reported comments he had made in earlier times about Trump . . . afterward, I can’t figure them out. Did he think I wouldn’t check further? Had he really reshaped the past in his memory to better fit the present? Does he genuinely think none of it really matters? Or did he just think that handling these questions as he did was the best tactic, however strong or weak his hand?\n\nEither way, much of what he said that was checkable seems to have been wildly far from the truth. First, Michael Wolff. Bannon had eventually indicated to me that his initial contact with Wolff came in April 2017, in the first hundred days of the Trump presidency. Many of the details contradicting this are in Wolff’s books, and I also spoke with Wolff to clarify things further. Wolff describes first encountering Bannon at the Orlando airport in early 2016, when it was Bannon, who was still running Breitbart News, who recognized and approached Wolff. That summer, soon after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, he invited Wolff up to Trump Tower. “I probably saw him three or four times that fall,” Wolff says; they carried on speaking throughout his time in the White House. “I liked him,” says Wolff. “I mean, he was an enormous pleasure to spend time with. He could not have been more open, more accessible—a better source and better company.” When I tell Wolff that Bannon pushed back against the notion that they had logged hundreds of hours of conversation over the years, he says, “Well, it’s all on tape.” He confirms that he heard Bannon’s disparaging summary of Trump’s chances, and of Trump having lost his stuff, directly from Bannon. “Oh yeah, many times,” Wolff says. “I mean, possibly he’s convinced himself otherwise. I don’t know. As I say, I have not spoken to him in some amount of time, but he’s come to make his money off of a different point of view. He knows where his bread is buttered. He plays a role. I mean, in a sense, when I was with him he was just playing a different role. At the time, he was the apostate Trump, the clear-eyed person, and all of the other people were incredible sycophants.”\n\nThen there’s Ira Rosen, the 60 Minutes producer whom Bannon claimed to barely know, telling me he only ever spoke to him for the 60 Minutes interview. I get hold of a copy of Rosen’s book, Ticking Clock: Behind the Scenes at 60 Minutes. The story it tells is so at odds with what Bannon professed that it is staggering. Rosen explains how he first met Bannon when working on a 60 Minutes story about insider trading in Washington—this was back in 2011—and how Bannon subsequently became someone he would meet up with periodically when Bannon was in New York. Rosen would trawl for gossip about Fox’s Roger Ailes while Bannon “encouraged me to do stories about the Washington swamp.” Immediately after Bannon took over the Trump campaign, Rosen, too, was invited up to the campaign headquarters. In his book, Rosen details some of their interactions and conversations, noting in passing that he and Bannon have exchanged more than a thousand text messages.\n\n\n\nCamerique/ClassicStock In 1993 Bannon, then an investment banker, was hired to help run Biosphere 2, near Tucson, a domed system of man-made environments where humans can practice subsistence. His brother, Chris, is still involved.\n\nAs for what Rosen says that Bannon told him about Trump’s purported dementia? One very good reason this didn’t form part of the substance of Bannon’s 60 Minutes interview is that these exchanges took place in the weeks and months afterward. Here is what Rosen wrote: “His criticism of Trump privately to me took on a different tone. He believed Trump was suffering from early-stage dementia and that there was a real possibility he would be removed from office by the Twenty-fifth Amendment, where the cabinet could vote that the president was no longer mentally capable of carrying out his duties. Bannon began to push that story hard. Bannon said that the president had no attention span, didn’t read, and now doesn’t listen. He said Trump repeats himself a lot, telling the same story minutes after he told it before.” In the book, Rosen describes how he sent Bannon an extract from a David Brooks column in The New York Times recounting that a group of senators recently meeting with Trump had seen “a president so repetitive and rambling, some thought he might be suffering from early Alzheimer’s,” and that Bannon texted back, “You need to do the 25th amendment piece . . . BTW brother I never steer u wrong.” I call up Rosen, who reaffirms that all of this is documented.\n\nAfter I leave Arizona, Bannon texts me intermittently, but the tempo increases as the battle toward a possible government shutdown nears. “Next couple of weeks going to be crazy nasty,” he predicts. “Toxic and Lit.” Reading his texts and watching his shows, I find it difficult to determine how much he is reporting on events and how much he may be playing a role in orchestrating them. (He certainly often seems to know what is going to happen next well before it happens.)\n\nA couple days before the shutdown deadline at the end of September, I visit Bannon in Washington. He returned from Arizona earlier that week. The burned-up palm tree, he updates me, has been taken down—“It broke my heart,” he says—but he’s still resisting its replacement by a shorter tree. He wants one the same size. He chooses to offer the following troubling analogy: He was always adamant that they should have built back the World Trade Center towers exactly where they were but one foot taller. “I want my palm tree,” he says.\n\nWe are in the Breitbart Embassy, just a couple blocks from the Capitol. (Bannon has War Room studios in various homes, but this is the principal one.) As ever, he is personally affable in a way that offers an almost baffling contrast to so many of his words and opinions. It’d be convenient to assume that this is all a front, that he is working me, but while I certainly don’t discount that component, for the most part I think that’s too easy an explanation. Whoever Steve Bannon in messy aggregate actually is, I don’t think you can begin to understand him without acknowledging that this version—the often considerate, genial, self-deprecating, open-to-other-opinions one—is, maybe confoundingly, a real part of him, too.\n\nI expect today’s conversation to be awkward. After we spend maybe an hour scuffling back and forth on other matters, I move to the lengthy list of statements and disavowals he made in Arizona that don’t seem to tally with what I’ve since found. Regarding his interactions with Michael Wolff, Bannon initially reiterates that he first met Wolff when he was in the White House but when pressed now recalls an earlier encounter the previous fall when Wolff was writing an article for The Hollywood Reporter. But we reach an impasse over many of the opinions and words Wolff describes and quotes Bannon as saying. “You have to come to your own assessment,” Bannon eventually declares. “You’re the writer. This shouldn’t be a tough one you have to struggle with. Two people have very different opinions.”\n\nI know, but one of them has got the quotes and the documented record of it, and I find it very hard to get past that.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write that that’s true and that I’m lying to you and I misled you. I don’t have a problem with that.”\n\nOkay.\n\n“This is not an existential moment.”\n\nIt feels to me that what he is saying here is something like this: People like you are hung up on the quaint idea that it’s truth that always matters the most. Sure, it has its uses, but in the big picture—and especially when things really heat up—it’s often way down any sensible list of priorities.\n\nWhen I move on to Ira Rosen and remind Bannon what he told me about only speaking to Rosen around the 60 Minutes interview, he immediately says, “Yes,” agreeing with himself. I explain that Rosen’s book gives a very different impression. “I don’t care what he says in his book,” Bannon retorts. I press on regardless.\n\nWould you agree that you were constantly texting each other?\n\n“I don’t remember that. So he’s got the text?”\n\nYeah. He says he has more than a thousand texts.\n\n“Are they in the book?”\n\nSome of them.\n\n“I don’t remember.”\n\nAre you saying they don’t exist?\n\n“I’m saying I don’t remember being in constant contact with Ira Rosen.”\n\nIt feels obvious to me that here and elsewhere Bannon is navigating a careful, evanescently thin line: repudiating what he can and then otherwise saying that he doesn’t remember, whether or not these are things someone could credibly fail to remember, rather than fully calling anyone a liar, with all the awkward new doors that might open.\n\nWhen I remind Bannon that Rosen’s name first came up, back in Arizona, when I read him Rosen’s quote about the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Bannon protests with renewed confidence as he did before—grounds for repudiation!—that if this were true it would have been asked about in the 60 Minutes interview. When I point out that this all took place after that, Bannon recalibrates his defense. “How did I have that then?” he says, as though he was suddenly so removed from Trump world that he would have had no means of judging anything like that about his former boss. “I didn’t speak to Trump for years,” he says. “That’s ridiculous.” (Aside from the fact that this contradicts both the general impression he has given me and others and his description to me of the call Trump made to him in Hong Kong after the 60 Minutes interview, Bannon is on more formal record stating otherwise. When he was interviewed by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigating purported Trump ties to Russia, on January 16, 2018, he was asked how many times he had spoken with Trump since leaving the White House. At first he answered, “I don’t remember,” but when pressed, “Is it more than ten?” he replied, “Yes.”)\n\nI say that Rosen claims to have all of this documented and read to Bannon his own text about the Twenty-fifth Amendment.\n\n“Okay, well, then you’ll have to go with . . .” He pauses. “I don’t remember that. And I don’t remember having that relationship with Ira Rosen.”\n\nA couple minutes later, Bannon tries a different tack. “Haven’t you been in the same situation as those two guys? Have I told you anything untoward to the president? That’s a yes-or-no question.”\n\nI agree that he has not.\n\n“Okay, fine,” he says, as though a point has been proved.\n\nI suggest that the real takeaway is maybe that he used to share a lot of uncareful thoughts with people and that he’s learned not to do so.\n\nDrew Angerer Trump speaks by phone to Russian president Vladimir Putin from the Oval Office on January 28, 2017, accompanied by, from left, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, and Bannon, then the White House Chief Strategist.\n\n“Then you’re going to have to write it how you have to write it,” he says. “We just have a disagreement. I think I’ve been very straightforward. Did we put any restrictions on this at all? You’re going to write what you’re going to write. You will lay out your case about Steve Bannon the way you see it. It’s your perspective. I have no problem with that. I’m not sitting here trying to talk you out of it: ‘Oh, please don’t . . .’ You just got to do what you got to do. Can I say something else? It’s also—it’s meaningless. But you ought to write it as you see it.”\n\nI ask him to explain what he means by “it’s meaningless.”\n\n“Because everybody knows that my loyalty to this movement and to him are unquestioned. If you look at the demonstrable record, there’s not even a question of who’s gone out of their way to support Trump the man and Trump the politician and the Trump movement. That’s just irrefutable fact. A couple of guys saying, ‘Hey, he said this, he said this’? That’s fine. I disagree with that. I don’t remember it. I don’t remember having long relationships with Michael Wolff or with particularly Ira Rosen. But I feel quite comfortable with my place in history, juxtaposed to what I’ve accomplished and what we’re accomplishing here. I feel pretty damn good.”\n\nHe says this as though it should, or even could, prove that the other stuff—the leaking and the careless trash-talking—is not true. (Bannon likes to use false binaries as a rhetorical device.) But of course they can both be true, and I suspect that they probably both broadly are. I try to return to the main reason, weeks ago, that I was asking about any of this—its effect, or otherwise, on his relationship with Trump. I begin by saying that although perhaps Trump is not aware chapter and verse of all this stuff that’s been published—at which point Bannon interrupts.\n\n“Oh, he knows it,” says Bannon. “Trust me. Anything has been published, they have put under his nose many times.”\n\nWe talk about different ways someone like Trump might view all this, and I float the possibility that Trump might allow someone like Bannon back in but that one’s card is nonetheless marked permanently, and one would never really be trusted. Bannon surprises me by allowing this possibility.\n\n“It may be,” he says. “It may be. Time will tell on that.”\n\nBoth in Arizona and in Washington, Bannon seemed keen that I should speak with Trump. Esquire sent the former president a series of questions about his and Bannon’s relationship but received no response.\n\nBy now I’ve spent a couple months watching War Room every day. I don’t agree with much, and I sometimes worry that I’m getting desensitized to thoughts that in clear fresh air would horrify me, but there are parts that I can just about see as fair’s-fair strong partisan advocacy. When it comes to issues like immigration and the war in Ukraine and the debt ceiling, while one might strongly dispute much of what is presented as fact, and the conclusions reached, these are nonetheless real, difficult quandaries where there exist good reasons for sensible, thoughtful people to disagree. Sometimes, though—a lot of the vaccine stuff, for instance—it just seems to me like crazy conspiratorial nonsense. Likewise the way in which disasters of almost any kind—the fire in Maui, the war in Israel, for instance—are opportunistically grabbed, with what seems to me as sickening glee, as notional proof of tendentious, and again often conspiratorial, government malfeasance. And every now and again what is broadcast seems just so nasty and vengeful and wrongheaded that I feel soiled just watching. As an example, there’s a recurrent subtext, dog-whistled but perfectly transparent, often when child trafficking is being discussed, that intimates in true QAnon style that some broad coalition of the Democratic and Hollywood establishment consists of pedophiles. Both what is being said and the manipulative if-you’re-smart-and-paying- attention-you’ll-know wink are repellent.\n\nAs accustomed as I become to all this, sometimes my reactions take me by surprise. One Wednesday in mid-September, Bannon launches into a sustained invective against Merrick Garland that, somehow, seems to step so far, heedlessly and recklessly, over any line. It’s the words themselves—“he is a purely evil individual . . . and he will pay for the evilness when we imprison him”—but also how insensibly and self-righteously angry Bannon seems. It makes good enough sense for Bannon, from his perspective, to disagree with Garland, and also to question whether Garland’s every decision is made in good faith. And I certainly doubt that Garland is without his flaws. But this attack just seems both wildly poisonous and, in its scale and certainty, empirically wrong. As Bannon himself says, history reveals. I suppose history could endorse Bannon’s view, but all my instincts are that there is no sensible reason for thinking this to be true, wherever you stand politically—and that to proclaim this, never mind potentially inspire people to act on its basis, goes unacceptably beyond fighting one’s corner.\n\nAt one point during our conversation in Washington, Bannon challenges me. “Do you think I believe this?” he asks, meaning what he advocates sitting here in the War Room studio. I explain, quite honestly, that I have thought about this question a lot. And then I tell him how shocked I was by the Merrick Garland diatribe.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland is evil. I shocked you?”\n\nYes, it really shocks me. Not only do I think you’re wrong; I think it’s disgusting that you think that.\n\n“Okay. Okay.”\n\nI can’t believe that there’s anything that you know that gives you the prerogative to think that.\n\n“Why do you say that? All the facts are out there of what he’s done. Look, he’s overseen rolling up of a thousand of these people. This one guy we talked about yesterday is three years hadn’t gone to trial. That’s pure evil of what he’s done about the J Six thing. Pure evil.”\n\nThat’s not evil. The whole thing was a complete shit show, and the rule of law is slowly working its way through it.\n\n“It’s not the rule of law. Upgrading to terrorism charges?”\n\nThere’s plenty to argue about there. I think Garland is trying to do his job. Evil? I don’t agree at all.\n\nChip Somodevilla Florida Republican Matt Gaetz (second from left, next to Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett), speaks to reporters in October 2023 during maneuverings over the House speakership. Gaetz, who made efforts to win concessions for MAGA Republicans, was a frequent guest on Bannon’s show during the chaotic run-up to a potential government shutdown.\n\n“This is the unbridgeable gap in the country. They think we’re evil. I saw last night! They think we’re building the Confederate army. That’s on MSNBC. That’s their belief. We’re building the Confederate army. They think we are pure evil. They think we’re racist. They think we’re domestic terrorists. They think we’re insurgents. This is what they think. And we think they’re evil. And you’re not going to bridge that gap.”\n\nBut that’s a tragedy.\n\n“Why is it a tragedy?”\n\nBecause in those terms, I think that you’re both wrong. (That is to say, insomuch as Bannon’s extreme characterization of the “other” side is accurate.)\n\n“Okay. You’re a reasonable man in the middle. You can weigh in measuring—you’re a kindhearted person, you think both sides are wrong. It’s like Ecclesiastes. It’s just not your time. I hate to say it: It’s just not your time. It’s us versus them. They hate us and we hate them. One side’s going to win here. And it’s going to get ugly. It’s going to get messy.”\n\nIn the days around and after my Washington trip, Bannon becomes far more visibly at the center of things.\n\n\n\nEven so, the looming end-of-September shutdown at first seems to play like something of a humiliation for him. His preference seemed to be for a disorderly shutdown, or at the very least for there to be major concessions to the MAGA wing. His show has been filled with those like Matt Gaetz maneuvering for this, and Bannon appears to be deeply involved in the strategizing. Then, on the final afternoon, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy makes a last-minute deal with the Democrats. The tempo of Bannon’s texts had been increasing, but after that, contact dries up and I assume that he is smarting. Gaetz has consistently said, and Bannon has echoed loudly, that if McCarthy did anything like this, Gaetz would move for McCarthy’s removal. Now Gaetz must either back down and look weak or press ahead, but the conventional wisdom is that his bluff has been called and he will be put in his place. Either hardcore MAGA Republicans will blanch at taking this final step or the Democrats will passively or actively move to allow McCarthy’s survival; Gaetz will be isolated as an extremist renegade.\n\nI’m traveling, so I don’t learn the result of the vote at the time. Not for another six minutes, anyway, when my phone pings with a two-word text from Bannon: “Told Ya.” McCarthy has gone, Congress is in turmoil, and things have played out Bannon’s way. By the end of the week, Bannon is back on the front cover of The New York Times, photographed in mid-broadcast, jabbing the index finger of his left hand to drive home a point.\n\nStill, after that, it zigs and zags back and forth. Candidates opposed by Bannon, candidates supported by him, crash and burn all the same. After two weeks of this, I text him, asking what way he sees out of this chaos. Or, I add, is the chaos okay?\n\nHis answer comes back immediately.\n\n“Chaos,” he writes, “is our friend.”\n\nThis, of course, is just a skirmish. Just a minor messiness. When the MAGA–friendly Mike Johnson eventually prevails as Speaker, I get a sense that for Bannon this is less a major victory than a fruitful bit of low-level agitation. The real mess, the real chaos, the real if-you-tear-it-down-they-will-come rupture . . . if Steve Bannon has his way, and he seems hell-bent on doing so, that is still to come.",

Here’s how we test products and why you should trust us.\n\n(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\nBy now, a number of people have shared the video of Rep. Bill Keating’s standing up for Rep. Sarah McBride against her being deliberately misgendered by dumbass Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas). In fact, Keating’s righteous blast at Self was so loud that it almost obscured McBride’s neat little thrust of the shiv when she responded to Self as “Madam Chair.” Sweet.\n\nAnyway, up here, Keating’s response to Self’s nasty introduction of McBride came as something of a surprise. In a congressional delegation containing a number of high-profile members, Bill Keating is something of a backbencher, even though he’s been in Congress since 2011, representing a district that includes Cape Cod and the south coast of Massachusetts. He’s always been a stalwart on issues affecting the LGBTQ+ communities. But the iron in his spine that he demonstrated in Congress the other day comes as no surprise to those of us who remember his noble but failed attempt to overthrow William Bulger as president of the state senate in 1994. This roughly coincided with Bulger’s serial-killer brother Whitey’s decision to go on the lam for 16 years. Still, not many people crossed either Bulger and walked away. Keith Self was no problem at all.\n\nOn Thursday, my friend John Feinstein passed away unexpectedly at the age of 69. During my days as a daily sports columnist—and, before that, as a daily sports reporter specializing in college basketball in the winter and tennis in the summer—John was a fairly consistent presence in my life in the traveling sportswriting circus that follows the major events of the calendar. A Final Four or a US Open in Flushing Meadows without John was unthinkable—though I have to admit that two weeks at the Open with John’s constant (and bad) imitation of Ivan Lendl could be a trial. In 1986, of course, he published , an account of a year spent with Bob Knight’s Indiana Hoosiers that, through the dint of his dogged reporting, was the first look into the fact that IU’s basketball team was being run by a sociopath (although, ultimately, the book pulled that punch). No matter, the book has now sold over 8 million copies, and it broke the best-seller lists for sports books of all kinds. After that, John turned out one book after another, like clockwork, every spring. There were two giants of Father’s Day book sales. One was Abraham Lincoln, and the other was John Feinstein.\n\nHe could be impossible. He was as dogmatic as anyone I ever met. He knew what he knew, and he thought he knew what you knew, and he would not be shaken in either belief. He had his favorites, and he was also unshakable in his support of them. (The most heated argument we ever had was over his support of the late Jim Valvano, whom John adored despite his disdain for most coaches who bent the rules as badly as Valvano did.) But dammit, he also had a heart as big as the Ritz, and that made all the difference, and how can you not love a guy who responded to Knight’s calling him both a “whore” and a “pimp” by saying he wished Knight would make up his mind so he’d know how to dress?\n\nThe great Dave McKenna has written a proper obituary over at Defector. We ran in different circles the past few years, and we’d fallen out of touch. Apparently, his last few years had been tinged with more than a little melancholy. I will miss knowing that he’s out there in the world, which is a much quieter place these days, and there are too many empty chairs at the table. May his memory be a blessing.\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Stomp Off, Let’s Go” (Fat Babies): Yeah, I pretty much still love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: Here, from 1955, is the arrival of Barbara Porritt, the millionth migrant to land in Australia. She shares the video with a Dutch family of 16. Considering how many “migrants” arrived in Australia against their will, the sunniness of this arrival is a nice historical antidote. History is so cool.\n\nIn advance of Himself’s Day on Monday, Micheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland, stopped by the White House this week and got a good close-up look at what we’ve done to ourselves nowadays. He was greeted by a presidential “episode” that must have made him wonder if all those decades of emigration had been worth it after all. From the AP:\n\nAsked if Ireland, a member of the EU, was taking advantage, too, Trump said, “of course they are. I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn’t have let it happen.” He was referring to the concentration of U.S. pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, due to the country’s tax policies. “We had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn’t have a clue or let’s say they weren’t businesspeople, but they didn’t have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies,” Trump said.\n\nMartin affected the look of a man who suddenly had found himself involved in a carny sideshow as the president went a-wandering in his mind.\n\nAt one point, Trump became distracted as he talked about inflation in the U.S. “By the way, I love these socks. What’s with these socks? I’m trying to stay focused, but I’m very impressed with the VP’s socks,” Trump said, drawing chuckles from others in the room. Vance had worn socks patterned with small green shamrocks as a nod to Martin’s visit. When a reporter asked Martin why his country would let [Rosie] O’Donnell move there, Trump jumped at the opening. “I like that question,” the president said, adding that Martin was “better off not knowing” about O’Donnell.\n\n(The “reporter” who lobbed this hunk of insane banality into the dialogue was Brian Glenn of the Real America’s Voice, a wing-nut marionette who was the guy who criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy for not wearing a suit when he met with the president and who also is famously the current main squeeze of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Here’s Tiger Beat on the Potomac taking Glenn’s bullshit seriously.)\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look at what we found! From Smithsonian:\n\nThe Donggung palace complex in present-day South Korea was once an elaborate lakeside retreat with at least 26 buildings used for hosting festivals and banquets. Now, archaeologists have also discovered several innovative “flush” toilets at the 1,300-year-old site, including one that likely drained into a nearby waterway. During recent excavations at the complex, researchers found a small two-room building with a hole in the middle of a cut granite slab, according to a statement from the Korean Heritage Service. On either side of the hole, they found wide stepping stones.\n\nExperts think waste from the toilet funneled into an underground holding chamber, similar to those used in outhouses or portable toilets. A servant likely poured water into the hole to flush the waste down a drain and into the chamber. Inside the palace, researchers also found a flush toilet that “directly discharges human waste into the river through a drain,” Kim Gyeong Yeol, an archaeologist with the Korean Heritage Service who led the recent excavations, tells Live Science’s Owen Jarus. The interior toilet was probably reserved for use by the crown prince and his court ladies.\n\nI would point out that this is pretty much the same system to which the Supreme Court gave its blessing not that long ago. Plus ça change, plus ça ick.\n\nHey ABC News, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nThe large rock was excavated from the Callide Basin in central Queensland and gifted to the Moura State High School, where it sat unnoticed for two decades, according to the University of Queensland. When paleontologists were asked by the school to examine a cluster of three-toed track marks on the boulder, they found it contains one of the highest concentrations of dinosaur footprints per square meter ever documented in the country, according to a paper published Monday in Historical Biology.\n\nThe rock contains 66 footprints from 47 individual dinosaurs, Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland and lead author of the study, said in a statement. The footprints were likely imprinted onto the boulder as the dinosaurs passed across a patch of wet, white clay, possibly walking along or crossing a waterway during the Early Jurassic period, about 200 million years ago, Romilio said. “It’s an unprecedented snapshot of dinosaur abundance, movement and behavior from a time when no fossilized dinosaur bones have been found in Australia,” Romilio said.\n\nIn addition to being the name of my next prog-rock band, Dinosaur Abundance appeals to me as a concept. Maybe they were all having a dance back in the day. In any case, they gathered then to make us happy now.\n\n\n\nI’ll be back on Monday for whatever fresh hell awaits. Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

        "content": "The prosecution of El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago wrapped up in Manhattan, but not before things got lively again. The defense called as its first witness one Robert Costello, who once advised prime prosecution witness Michael Cohen. (Costello was a close associate of Rudy Giuliani, which figures.) Costello has been a critic of the state’s case in the Stormy Daniels payoff case, and of Cohen, once the latter hit the silk on the former president*. There was extended legal wrangling over whether Costello could testify at all and, at least, about the limits of what he would be allowed to say. Once he got on the stand, however, he put on a very impressive show. Judge Juan Merchan was not amused. From The Guardian:\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ordered the courtroom cleared of reporters after warning Robert Costello about his responses to sustained objections. “I want to discuss proper decorum in my courtroom,” Merchan said. “So when there’s a witness on the stand and you don’t like my ruling, you don’t say ‘jeez,’ and you don’t say ‘strike it.’ Because I’m the only one who can strike....You don’t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?”\n\n“Clear the courtroom,” he then ordered.\n\nThe media have been allowed back inside after Judge Juan Merchan ordered to clear the courtroom. Court officers and Merchan would not let an attorney for the press make an application to argue for the right to stay in the courtroom. Under the law, a representative for the media or even a member of the media is allowed to petition in open court for the opportunity to stay. Trump’s non-lawyer entourage was allowed to stay.\n\nMonday’s “non-lawyer entourage” included Bernie Kerik and Alan Dershowitz. I guess we’re down to the U-Team now.",

        "title": "Chuck Schumer Just Shredded His Own Credibility",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "Chuck Schumer is done like dinner. His announcement on Thursday that he is surrendering to the House’s stopgap vivisection of what vital programs still have survived this administration’s bloodletting shreds what’s left of his credibility as a leader in the Senate and as a national leader in the Democratic party. It doesn’t matter whether he can muster enough votes to stay minority leader—and given what he did on Thursday, he’s likely to be the leader of a Democratic Senate minority for a long time—it no longer matters. As the months go on, and as the president and his ketamine-fueled button man continue their assault on the federal government, now with the complicity of both houses of Congress, Schumer is going to look increasingly silly and irrelevant. Absent an outright mutiny on the Senate floor, that complicity will gain his party ... nothing.\n\nSchumer certainly orchestrated his surrender well—a speech to the Senate, a press conference, and an op-ed in The New York Times. He never can say he wasn’t allowed to make his case. From Politico:\n\nHis points were two-fold: First, a shutdown would play into Trump and Musk’s hands, he argued, allowing them to continue with their slash-and-burn campaign overdrive. His second argument was more political—and in keeping with his long history as a leading strategist counseling his party to pay heed to the concerns of America’s middle class above all else. “For Donald Trump, a shutdown would be a gift,” Schumer said. “It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.\n\n“Right now, Donald Trump owns the chaos in the government. He owns the chaos in the stock market,” he added. “In a shutdown, we would be busy fighting with Republicans over which agencies to reopen, which to keep closed, instead of debating the damage Donald Trump’s agenda is causing the American people.”\n\nThe obvious rejoinder is to point out that, for all practical purposes, the administration is shutting down the government anyway, and that by walking away from the fight and giving away what little leverage he has, Schumer has foreclosed any real political opportunity that might have presented itself by making the president “own” the chaos in government. Quite simply, Schumer now “owns” a part of the chaos going forward. The only question is how many Democrats want to partner with him in this new acquisition.\n\nA substantial portion of the Democratic caucus in the House feels hosed. They unanimously lined up against the plan—unafraid of the perils that so spooked Schumer about a shutdown. I think the Democratic members of the House recognized the obvious—that there is no palpable political advantage to be gained in helping the current administration. And if the most recent Quinnipiac poll is to be believed, 53 percent of respondents already blamed the Republicans for any shutdown before Schumer hit the silk. This is because those people looked at what the Republicans already were doing.\n\nMoreover, Schumer’s unilateral surrender completely ignores the fact that the administration is being rendered into sticks and splinters every time it finds itself in front of a federal court. Most recently, we had federal district judge William Alsup’s almost unprecedented ass-kicking in which he angrily ruled that thousands of laid-off federal workers be offered their old jobs back forthwith. From Politico:\n\nAlsup issued his ruling in a lawsuit brought by federal employee unions. He lashed out at the Justice Department over its handling of the case, saying he believes that Trump administration lawyers were hiding the facts about who directed the mass firings. “You will not bring the people in here to be cross-examined. You’re afraid to do so because you know cross examination would reveal the truth,” the judge said to a DOJ attorney during a hearing Thursday. “I tend to doubt that you’re telling me the truth. … I’m tired of seeing you stonewall on trying to get at the truth. ... It is sad, a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that’s a lie,” Alsup said.\n\nAnother federal district judge, this one in Maryland, ruled the same way on the same day. From The Washington Post:\n\n[James] Bredar, the judge, had signaled at a recent hearing he was likely to agree, noting to a Justice Department attorney that the case was not about whether the government can terminate people, but if those terminations were conducted legally. At one point, Bredar quoted the Silicon Valley mantra embraced by DOGE head Musk: “Move fast and break things.”\n\n\"Move fast? Fine,” Bredar said. “Break things? If that involves breaking the law, then that becomes problematic.”\n\nSchumer’s capitulation takes a lot of the political power out of how staunchly the federal courts have stood against the onslaught of the MAGA crew. Sooner or later, the administration is going to act in obvious contempt of court and, possibly, that will go up to the Supreme Court, which would have the opportunity to revisit its horrendous presidential-immunity decision from last July. This is only one of the righteous fights on which Chuck Schumer now has taken a pass. It’s time for someone to buy him a gold watch, thank him for his service, and shuffle him off the stage. He is not a wartime consigliere.\n\nRelated Story EPA Chief Lee Zeldin Is on a Mission to Let the Polluters Pollute\n\n\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "What are the latest Deep Thoughts from MAGAland? Let’s take a look.\n\nHere’s Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins on Fox News endorsing a unique strategy to cope with the rising cost of eggs.\n\n“I think the silver lining in all of this is, how do we, in our backyards—we’ve got chickens too in our backyard—how do we solve for something like this? And people are sort of looking around thinking, ‘Wow, well maybe I could get a chicken in my backyard,’ and it’s awesome.”\n\nRemember the Nevada Senate primary, when GOP favorite Sue Lowden suggested that people pay for their medical care with chickens, like the frontier farmer doctors used to do? (Admit it. You do remember it, ya bastids.) Turns out she was ahead of her time. We could have an entire economy conducted with a poultry-based currency by now. Still a better idea than tariffs.\n\nAlso, too: bird flu!\n\nThen we move along to the latest from Alina Habba, the famous parking-garage attorney. From NBC News:\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the White House lawn, Habba was asked about fired workers whom Democrats have invited to President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress on Tuesday night. Habba defended the cuts and said she had no sympathy for the thousands of people who have lost their jobs. “I really don’t feel sorry for them,” Habba said. “They should get back to work for the American people, like President Trump and this administration.”\n\nA reporter then noted that some military veterans have been part of that group.\n\n“That’s something the president has always cared about—anybody in blue, anybody that serves this country. But at the same time, we have taxpayer dollars, we have a fiscal responsibility to use taxpayer dollars to pay people that actually work,” she said. “That doesn’t mean that we forget our veterans by any means. We are going to care for them in the right way, but perhaps they’re not fit to have a job at this moment, or not willing to come to work. And we can’t, you know, I wouldn’t take money from you and pay somebody and say, ‘Sorry, you know, they’re not going to come to work.’ It’s just not acceptable.”\n\nConsidering that 90 percent of the hires of this administration are “not fit” for the jobs they hold, including Ms. Habba her own self, this is a bold position to take.\n\nThen there are the Fox News weekend C-listers, including the wife of our present secretary of transportation, lauding Idaho for bringing back cursive writing in the public schools. From C&L:\n\nFox News hosts posited that Democrats were conspiring to end cursive writing in schools so children are unable to read the U.S. Constitution. During a Sunday segment on Fox & Friends Weekend, co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy noted that one Idaho bill would force schools to teach cursive in elementary schools. “So you guys, I didn’t realize this is a generational thing,” Campos-Duffy said. “I talked to our producers, who are a lot younger than us. And they said some of them don’t write in cursive, and they don’t even know how.”\n\nCo-host Peter Doocy noted that Democratic former President Joe Biden had “bad” cursive handwriting. “But you know, one of my favorite conspiracy theories, and I kind of believe it, is that the reason Democrats don’t want people to learn how to write cursive is so they can’t read the actual Constitution,” co-host Charlie Hurt opined.\n\nDoes Mr. Hurt drop in f’s in place of s’s when he writes home to his mother? That must be very confusing.\n\nAnd, finally, there’s Kingsley Wilson, a deputy director of public affairs at the Defense Department, who would like you to know that everything you know about an infamous case of lynching in 1915 is wrong.\n\nLeo Frank raped & murdered a 13-year-old girl. He also tried to frame a Black man for his crime. The ADL turned off the comments because they want to gaslight you.\n\nActually, I suspect they turned off the comments because they got tired of the looney revisionism in a 110-year-old case that is still fraught with controversy.\n\nJesus, these really are the mole people.",

        "content": "Lee Zeldin, the new boss of the Environmental Protection Agency, isn’t kidding around. He’s spoilin’ for some despoilin’, and he doesn’t care who knows it. From :\n\nLee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reframed the purpose of the E.P.A. In a two-minute-and-18-second video posted to X, Mr. Zeldin boasted about the changes and said his agency’s mission is to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”\n\n“From the campaign trail to Day 1 and beyond, President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living,” Mr. Zeldin said. “We at E.P.A. will do our part to power the great American comeback.” Nowhere in the video did he refer to protecting the environment or public health, twin tenets that have guided the agency since its founding in 1970.\n\nBecause, as we know, there is no public cost to environmentally inflicted disease or industrial pollution.\n\nMr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would unwind more than two dozen protections against air and water pollution. It would overturn limits on soot from smokestacks that have been linked to respiratory problems in humans and premature deaths as well as restrictions on emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin. It would get rid of the “good neighbor rule” that requires states to address their own pollution when it’s carried by winds into neighboring states. And it would eliminate enforcement efforts that prioritize the protection of poor and minority communities.\n\nGive Zeldin credit. He may have decided that his job is to help Republican donors poison the whole damn country, but he has by God learned his lines well.\n\nIn perhaps its most consequential act, the agency said it would work to erase the E.P.A.’s legal authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by reconsidering decades of science that show global warming is endangering humanity. In his video, Mr. Zeldin derisively referred to that legal underpinning as “the holy grail of the climate change religion.” Mr. Zeldin called Wednesday’s actions “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history.” He added, “today the green new scam ends, as the E.P.A. does its part to usher in a golden age of American success.”\n\nIt is a well-established fact that the average American corporation doesn’t have the social conscience God gave the Gaboon viper. Now that attitude has a friendly administration. Zeldin’s brief is to keep the Environmental Protection Agency from doing anything substantive to protect the environment. Here is what passes for optimism.\n\nThe announcements do not carry the force of law. In almost every case, the E.P.A. would have to undergo a lengthy process of public comment and develop environmental and economic justifications for the change.\n\nFirst of all, Zeldin and the administration couldn’t care less about what is said in the “process” of public comment, and they will pull their environmental and economic justifications for the despoilin’ out of the collected works of Professor Otto Yerass. And nobody will be there to stop them. And not for nothing, as Senator Sheldon Whitehouse points out, Zeldin probably lied during his confirmation hearings.\n\n“Today is the day Trump’s Big Oil megadonors paid for,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said. He called the E.P.A. moves a series of attacks on clean air, clean water and affordable energy. “Administrator Zeldin clearly lied when he told us that he would respect the science and listen to the experts,” Mr. Whitehouse said, referring to Mr. Zeldin’s confirmation hearing.\n\nNot that anyone who matters cares. Rivers will die now, choked to death by Fox News talking points.\n\n",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "As long as nobody calls it a cult or anything.\n\nOn Monday, two United States senators, Tommy Tuberville and J.D. Vance, took a pilgrimage to the Manhattan courthouse in which Michael Cohen was explaining to a jury everything he did while being paid by the former president* to be a schmuck to the entire outside world. By all accounts, Cohen was a model witness, though we should hold all tickets on that bet until we see how he does under cross-examination. Far more interesting were the two legislative acolytes who came to pay homage. It’s like the courthouse is now Fatima, with farts. From Politico:\n\nOn Monday, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen faced ridicule from Trump’s entourage visiting the courthouse, including GOP Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, as the prosecution’s star witness had his first day on the stand. “This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse. “Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says?”\n\n“We got a courtroom, this most depressing thing I’ve ever been in,” Tuberville said. “Mental anguish is trying to be pushed on the Republican candidate for the president of the United States.”\n\nAnd they weren’t alone. The senators were joined in their witness by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, as well as the attorneys general of Iowa and Alabama, who apparently have little to do these days. Taxpayers in those two states certainly got their money’s worth paying the salaries of these two clucks. Moreover, Tuesday promised even more pilgrims to the shrine. Vivek Ramaswamy, re-emerging from having his operating systems updated, promised to come and pay tribute, as did Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson.\n\nFor the benefit of those keeping score at home, Speaker Moses, who is a very good Christian man, is going to New York to support an unapologetic defendant in a criminal scheme that violated at least half the Ten Commandments. That should be a tinhorn tent revival of a type unseen since Jimmy Swaggart took to the podium and tearfully copped to doing missionary work in various motels in the neighborhood we like to call Out by the Airport. It is Politico’s analysis that these pilgrims are coming to court in order to meet the press and say all the stuff the defendant can’t say because Judge Juan Merchan may toss him in the hoosegow. How did these young journos ever get so cynical?",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "At the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, the last Sunday of October 2023 was Pastor Appreciation Day. The church was festive, the service well attended. There was strawberry cake, Pastor Copeland’s favorite, and special music in his honor by two of his closest friends, who sang a program of Baptist hymns, accompanying themselves on piano. Bernard Vann, the church’s elder statesman, spoke from the pulpit on behalf of the congregation, testifying as to how blessed they all felt that Bubba Copeland had entered their lives and bestowed his gifts, bound them together as a spiritual community. After reading a very long list of duties that make up a churchman’s life, Vann ribbed Bubba that he sure was getting a lot of attention that day for a job that’s just “one day a week.” Then he turned to Bubba and said, “We as a church love you, and we appreciate you for everything you’ve done,” with the true feeling of an old man, as he embraced his pastor.\n\nOnce Vann took his seat, Bubba stepped up to the pulpit. “I am so undeserving,” he said. “I don’t come from a background of being a pastor. I come from a background of loving people. And I believe there’s a giant difference between being a Christian and being Christlike. I try my best to be Christlike. There’s a lot of Christians that hurt people. What we should strive to do is go out of our way to love people unconditionally, despite who they are, what they are—because you know why? Jesus loves me.”\n\nBubba would often talk about how his life had been suffused with a grace that was beyond his comprehension. He believed that was the essence of God, and today he was telling his congregation that if God could love him—of all people—it was a sure sign that God loved everyone created in His image.\n\nThat last Sunday of October 2023 would be the last Sunday of Bubba Copeland’s life.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Copeland was forty-nine and the mayor of his hometown. In his corner of the world, he was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The world can be an unforgiving place, quick to judge, and friendships can be fleeting. Would the people whose regard means the most to us look at us differently if they learned of our hidden selves? Would they abandon us? Surely God knows our secrets. What does He think of us?\n\nThis is a story about just that—what God thinks. It’s also a story of identity and exposure, of revenge and public humiliation. Of deep love and senseless loss, and the unending grief of a small town.\n\nAnd secrets. It is a story about secrets.\n\nBubba Copeland had many secrets. And as a servant to both God and man, the judgments of heaven and earth were the alpha and omega of Bubba’s existence. What God thinks of anything, much less any of us, is difficult to discern, if we are honest. But the people of the First Baptist Church of Phenix City, Alabama, unabashedly adored Bubba.\n\nHe was empathetic and industrious and always seemed to be doing something for somebody. By last fall, he had been the senior pastor at First Baptist for four years and the church’s youth minister for fifteen years before that. Bubba was not seminary trained and was not what you might call an intellectual from the pulpit, but what he lacked in academic theology he made up for in his eagerness to answer to the spiritual and material needs of others, no matter the time or expense. According to the people in his church family who knew him best and loved him most, Bubba possessed an enormous capacity to serve, and his sermons were personal, compassionate, and often funny. As a Christian and as a pastor, he thought that in a pinch the Sermon on the Mount was just about all the Bible a man would ever need, and his favorite verse was Matthew 7:1—“Judge not, that ye be not judged.” All he knew about the ministry he had learned by the side of his first father-in-law, Dr. Eugene Langner, who pastored to the souls of the congregation at First Baptist Church for thirty years until his death in 2013. Even after Bubba and Merrigail, Langner’s daughter, got divorced, the two men maintained a loving friendship. Bubba and Merrigail had given Langner a grandson, after all. Young Carter Copeland would grow up underfoot at the church, singing hymns from the pulpit with a poise that would make his father cry. Grandfather, father, and son remained exceptionally close, their relationships unburdened by the strain that often comes with divorce.\n\nBy the last Sunday of October 2023, not only were Bubba and his second wife, Angela, and his two stepdaughters the first family of First Baptist Church, but the Copelands were also the first family of nearby Smiths Station, Bubba’s hometown, where he was finishing his second term as mayor. He was renowned for bringing a Love’s truck stop to the main highway through town, a feat of economic development that most mayors of towns the size of Smiths Station (population: 5,470) can only dream of—to hear the awe with which the people there talk about that truck stop, you’d think Bubba had brought IBM to town. When a tornado struck Smiths Station in 2019, killing twenty-three East Alabamians in the neighboring community of Beauregard, he was a twenty-four-hour one-man rescue crew—removing debris, providing supplies and reliable information to his people, and offering hugs when nothing else would do. That same year, when a high school senior in Smiths Station named Lexi Webb took her own life, Bubba initiated #SSNotOneMore, a suicide-prevention campaign. On the night before school started, without telling anyone they were doing it, Bubba and a group of volunteers scattered hundreds of signs all over town: YOU ARE WORTHY OF LOVE. YOUR MISTAKES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU MATTER. DON’T GIVE UP. He had Post-it notes printed with the same affirmations and had volunteers pass them out at all the schools.\n\nIn his spare time, Bubba also owned and operated the Country Market over in Salem, where he had a reputation for employing local folks who might have trouble finding work elsewhere. His social-media feed was always full of cheerful posts about the latest specials on pork butts and paper towels. Life was good, if maybe a bit hectic.\n\nIn his corner of the world, Bubba Copeland was needed, and he loved being needed.\n\nDavid White, a retired doctor and chairman of the First Baptist Church board of trustees, was always urging Bubba to take a break, get out of town with Angela and the girls on vacation, disconnect for a while. “My only concern for Bubba was that he was spread too thin,” White says. “But his idea of a vacation was thinking up new outreach programs for the church.”\n\nThe Reverend Ralph Wooten, who for several years was pastor of the First United Methodist Church in Phenix City, says he first saw Bubba “emerging from a cloud of barbecue smoke” at the First Baptist annual cookout, and the two men became dear friends. “Bubba was a father of a blended family. He was a husband. He was a pastor. He was a successful small-business owner. And he was the mayor of a town that he loved,” says Wooten. “Any one of those things is enough for one human being, and yet he was all of those things. I knew it was a lot and encouraged him to take care of himself. He seemed to be taking it all in stride.”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Carter Copeland, Bubba’s son, is a student at Auburn and was asleep when the story about his father broke. He awoke to a text from his best friend: “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say.”\n\nDaniel Windsor, a dentist in Phenix City and a longtime member of Bubba’s church, says that Bubba was a “five-finger friend”—that is, he was one of a small group of cherished people in Windsor’s life so vital that you can count them on one hand. “He was an indispensable friend—and I loved him dearly,” Windsor says.\n\nJay Jones, the sheriff of Lee County, Alabama, says that “Bubba was hard not to like. He was that selfless and that reliable, the sort of person who rushes toward need, no questions asked. There aren’t that many people like Bubba in this world.”\n\nThe sign on the lawn in front of Bubba’s church read ALL ARE WELCOME. And all were welcome. For Bubba, that was how God worked in people. You might call it the essence of the Copeland theology. “Ain’t God good?” he would say to friends and strangers alike. And with Bubba, you were never a stranger for long.\n\nDan Elkins became a member of First Baptist Church in 2018. He was himself a Baptist minister and for ten years had successfully tended his own flock in an “itty-bitty” town in southern Alabama. Married with two kids, Elkins had tried to make his marriage work even though he had known for years that he was gay. After he and his wife divorced in 2003, he resettled in Phenix City, where he would meet his husband, Jason Price. Their first date was at the Home Depot. “In case it didn’t work out, you always need something at Home Depot, right?” Price says with a laugh.\n\nBoth Elkins and Price have a deep faith and struggled to find a church that would be a true spiritual home for them, where they would be welcomed as full-fledged members, not “as lesser than.” “There’s churches that will cash our checks and let me and my husband sit in the back pew, but we didn’t want that. We feel that we have a lot to give and love being involved in a vibrant community,” Elkins says. They had heard good things about First Baptist in Phenix City, but Price had serious reservations about committing to a Baptist church. “I thought, I ain’t going to no Southern Baptist church,” he says. “Been there, done that.”\n\nElkins first wanted to talk to the pastor, have a frank conversation, and manage everyone’s expectations from the start. Elkins called the mayor’s office in Smiths Station, and Bubba said to come on by. “We sat there across from each other, and I told him that Jason and I wanted to be members of a church where we would be treated with dignity and respect and welcomed without reservation.” Instantly, Bubba responded, “Dan, you are my brother. God has blessed our church by sending you to join us.” Bubba added that his son was gay and that he was “not sure how to relate to him. God has brought you into my life to be Carter’s gay stepdad.”\n\n“So we joined First Baptist and never looked back,” Elkins says. “It’s hard for me to express the depth of my gratitude for what Bubba gave us.”\n\nIt’s not that Bubba’s friends idealized him or thought he was perfect—they didn’t, and he wasn’t. For one, he had to keep a laminate of the Lord’s Prayer in a right-hand corner of the pulpit at First Baptist, as he sometimes forgot the words. A bigger problem for Bubba was that he worried too much about what people thought of him. And he spent way too much time looking at his phone. These days, of course, there is a direct correlation between those two things. Bubba felt an unending sense of responsibility to the people of his church family and to the people of Smiths Station. An unkind comment on Facebook could keep him up at night. If this is a common modern affliction, Bubba had an acute case.\n\nIt would be his undoing.\n\nAt the end of the Pastor Appreciation Day service, Bubba joined Dan Elkins and Daniel Windsor at the piano on the altar to sing a favorite song. The Lord did not bless Bubba with much of a singing voice, but what he lacked in talent he made up for in effort. The song was “Sweet Beulah Land,” and the second verse goes like this:\n\nI’m looking now, just across the river\n\nTo where my faith shall end in sight\n\nThere’s just a few more days to labor\n\nThen I will take my heavenly flight\n\nThree days later, on the morning of Wednesday, November 1, an online news site called 1819 News, which states as its mission the promotion of “Alabama values,” published a story about Bubba Copeland and all his secrets. Titled “The secret life of Smiths Station Mayor and Baptist pastor F. L. ‘Bubba’ Copeland as a ‘transgender curvy girl,’ ” the story was about Bubba’s hidden online life and featured pictures of him in makeup and a blond wig, wearing women’s underwear and clothes. He had posted the pictures to Reddit subgroups, including one called TransLater, where they would collect comments such as “Sister you look beautiful. Cute outfit,” and Bubba would reply, “Thank you doll!”\n\nAndrew Hetherington Dan Elkins and David White at White’s dinner table, where a somber group gathered the morning after Bubba’s death to plan the future of First Baptist Church.\n\nWhen the 1819 News correspondent, Craig Monger, had called for comment, Bubba had begged him not to publish the story, fearing that news of his private life exploding into public view would embarrass his family, his town, and his church. Dressing up was something he and his wife had done on a lark, he told Monger. He then went further, saying that cross-­dressing was something he had done on occasion since he was a young man, a hobby to relieve stress. “I have a lot of stress,” he told Monger. “I’m not medically transitioning. It’s just a bit of a character I’m playing.”\n\n“The more I talked to them, the more turned around it got,” Bubba would tell a friend.\n\nWhen the story hit the next morning, Bubba’s son Carter, a junior at Auburn, was still asleep. He woke up to a text from his best friend that read, “I’m so sorry. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to do.”\n\n“I had no idea what she was talking about,” Carter says. “I called her, and she told me what had happened. Immediately, I looked up my dad’s name online and saw it everywhere. It was early in the morning, and every news outlet I’d never heard of had already jumped on it, like piranhas. I watched the whole world tear him down almost instantaneously.”\n\nCarter and his father were extremely close. Over the years, each had confided in the other about their innermost struggles—in high school, Carter had come out to his father, and Bubba had shared his secrets with his son. Carter was shocked at the meanness of the story and was overcome with a visceral fear that he had never known before. In a panic, he called his dad.\n\n“He picked up and said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘What are you talking about, Good morning?!’ Trying to calm me down, he again slowly said, ‘Good morning, buddy.’ And I said, ‘Okay, good morning.’ And then I said, ‘Dad, we have to talk.’ And he said, ‘No, we don’t. I need to get into a meeting. I have people I need to take care of. We’ll talk later.’ ”\n\nAfraid, and not knowing what else to do, Carter wrote to the story’s author, whose email address was posted on the 1819 News website. He received no response. The next day, Thursday, November 2, he wrote to him again:\n\n\n\nMr. Monger,\n\n. . . I am Bubba Copeland’s son. What you have done is not by any means journalism. You have hurt the man who has been here for me my entire life. My father is my hero, always has been, and always will be. I have seen some awful things in this world and experienced a great deal of hatred myself as a gay man. You have fueled a fire of hatred and bigotry unlike any other I have ever seen in my life. I have over the last 24 hours watched my father completely break down. I truly wish I could express to you the emotions and the feelings I feel towards you and your colleagues, but I am unable at this time. My only wish now is that you are able to carry on with your life and have the peace which you have so heartlessly taken from countless lives by writing this article. . . . If you find time in your day to step aside from your [duties] I would greatly appreciate a call. More than anything else I would like to tell you the kind of person my father really is. You should truly be ashamed of yourself.\n\nBy that day, Bubba’s family, his church family, and several of his closest friends in Smiths Station had become concerned that he might harm himself. The 1819 News story was all anybody was talking about. And another story—more lurid, more humiliating, harder to explain—was on the way and would reveal the last of Bubba’s secrets to the entire world. He was in disbelief at the coverage, and the brutal anonymity of the hate pouring onto the First Baptist website and Facebook feed beggared belief.\n\nHypocrite!\n\nHAHA faggot.\n\nYou should kill yourself.\n\n\n\nJason Price and Dan Elkins were the administrators for the church accounts. Along with another volunteer from the church, they would stay up all night taking down the comments so that Bubba wouldn’t see them. But Bubba couldn’t sleep and was fixated on the velocity and reach of the Internet and its lacerating judgments. As the calendar turned from Thursday to Friday, the community of people who knew him best and loved him most—the people you have just met, and many more besides—desperately tried to form a bulwark between him and the ugliness of the world.\n\nBubba, hold your head high. You are so loved and have so much support.\n\nBubba, you are going to get through this—we are going to get through this, together.\n\nBubba, just hold on, brother—get out of town for a few days, this will blow over.\n\nBubba responded: These are dark days.\n\nSensing his growing despair, his friends and family began sending more urgent messages:\n\nBubba, where are the guns?\n\nBubba, we can’t do this without you. How are we going to live our lives without you?\n\nWhen the world comes at you, though, it comes at you.\n\nThe story had gone global, and Bubba couldn’t look away from his phone. Have you seen the New York Daily News? he would ask friends, obsessing over the latest headline.\n\nThis article appeared in the April/May 2024 issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nElizabeth White, a WRBL News 3 crime reporter based in Auburn, Alabama, who reported on Bubba in his capacity as mayor of Smiths Station, says that “Bubba was down, and they just kept kicking and kicking and kicking. It wasn’t enough for them to just expose him. They wanted to hurt him. It’s devastating to know that for all the good he did, he spent his last days and moments in unbearable anguish.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, November 3, feeling all but destroyed, Bubba Copeland finished the job and killed himself.\n\nThe Lee County coroner, Daniel Sexton, would write in his report that the cause of death was a .38 slug to the right side of Bubba’s head, just above the ear. But no clinical description of what a handgun can do to flesh and bone will ever capture the true cause of Bubba Copeland’s death.\n\nThe next morning, Bubba’s son again wrote to Craig Monger:\n\nI hope if you ever have children, they never have to face what I am now going through. I hope that they never have to find out that their father caused another man’s death by his own hand. You and your colleagues took my father from me. . . . I hope the Lord’s judgment for you is swift and deliberate.\n\nCarter Copeland is still waiting for a reply.\n\n\n\nWhen a stranger comes to a small town asking painful questions of a grieving community, the third degree is not only understandable, it’s to be expected.\n\n\n\n“You like coffee?” David White asks me. “Well, if you’re in Phenix City anyway, then I guess you should come by so we can look each other in the eye and size each other up.”\n\nThe doctor and his wife, Lori, live across the street from First Baptist Church. He is quick to point out that on Easter Sunday in 1865, Union general James H. Wilson began one of the last battles of the Civil War from his yard, staging his attack on Confederate fortifications across the Chattahoochee River in Columbus, Georgia, before going on to capture Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. White is bemused at his proximity to this history. In fact, he seems to wear a bemused expression as his face’s default setting. The staging area used by Wilson’s Raiders is now used to stage White’s beehives; his family’s annual “canning kitchen,” in which they put up thousands of jars of fruit preserves and jellies and pickles to give away to friends and strangers far and wide at Christmas; his own small vineyard, where he cultivates grapes for a wine that’s “best served in Dixie cups”; and the pits for the church barbecue on the last Saturday in April, where they’ll smoke two thousand pounds of pork.\n\nCourtesy of family Bubba would describe his cross-dressing as “a hobby I do to relieve stress.”\n\nWhite is from Phenix City, fifth generation, and grew up in this house, which was built in 1906. During the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, as there were no hospitals, the house was made into a flu infirmary, with the sick and dying in the front and concerned family members coming and going from the back, the two halves separated by a heavy curtain that no one was allowed to cross except for the nurse. The doctor would come once a day to leave morphine and aspirin, pronounce the dead, and figure out where to put the new arrivals. “There’s a Black community a quarter mile that way,” White says. “We all grew up together. That’s the way it was. And in those days, nobody had anything, so there was no economic distinction between neighbors. It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t good, but it was a lot of people striving together to get by. It wasn’t all Ku Klux Klan.”\n\nPer the census, Phenix City has a population of thirty-eight thousand, spread out along the Chattahoochee River, straddling Lee and Russell counties. But it has the feeling of a smaller town, essentially a modest suburb of Columbus, Georgia, directly across the river. Roughly half Black and half white, the diverse population is reflected in First Baptist’s congregation.\n\nWhite’s father was born in this house in 1917 and was a newborn when both of his parents became gravely ill with the flu. The nurse was caring for White’s grandparents, who were laid out in the front of the house, and the baby was quarantined on the back porch. The need was so great, and the nurse was doing the best she could, but at one stretch she forgot about the newborn and went forty hours straight without crossing the curtain. When she realized what she’d done, she just knew that the baby was dead. She rushed through the curtain to the rear of the house only to find a six-year-old Black boy named Roy Pierson—who had sick family in the front of the house, too, and had himself been lost in the shuffle—caring for the baby, who was quite alive. “Roy was not big enough to pick him up. So he would sleep under the cradle and rock him, and he did his best to keep him clean, but he couldn’t figure out how to feed him. So he would get food and he would chew it up, and he would take it from his mouth and put it into my father’s mouth,” White says. “So when I came along in the South in the early sixties, my Uncle Roy was a Black man. He was my father’s brother, as much of a brother as my father would ever have, and they could not have been any closer had they been related by blood. That’s kind of the weave of the history here.”\n\nHe is wearing that bemused expression, but just the night before, White had been on the phone for half an hour, sternly interrogating me about why I had come to Phenix City. “We are hurting, our friend is gone, and we don’t need more salaciousness and scandal,” he said. “The press—so-called—did this to Bubba. Why would we talk to the press? People are concerned.”\n\nHe pours the coffee and says, “The people you are here to meet are still in shock at what happened and feel a profound sense of failure at not being able to save our friend. But if we are talking to you, it’s because we don’t want 1819 News to be the last word on Bubba Copeland.”\n\nThe people who exposed Bubba’s secrets said they presumed several things about him, chiefly that he was a hypocrite, preaching hate publicly for the life that he led privately. Bryan Dawson, the founder of 1819 News, would say publicly the week after Bubba’s suicide that Copeland was “pretending to be one thing—uber-conservative, Baptist, Trump, Christian, all of that”—while living a life that made a lie of those claims. Maybe Dawson was making broad assumptions about what it means to be a Baptist preacher in Alabama, but if he and his editorial team had known more about Bubba Copeland, they would have known that that assertion was far from accurate. Dawson would also admit that not only had he never heard of Bubba Copeland before receiving “a tip” about his online life, he had also never heard of Smiths Station.\n\nThe story of the Internet is of tribes hurling rocks over the horizon at targets they cannot see, doing damage that they do not care to measure. In this case, those assumptions and that ignorance would make Bubba less a human being than an ideological target in a raging culture war, and the damage radiating through these towns is now plain for all with eyes to see. And it’s not just these towns. Coinciding with the breakdown of our social order and abetted by technology of astonishing power, we find ourselves in a conflict over rapidly changing conceptions of gender and sexual difference. In the backlash to this upheaval, the casualties are mounting.\n\nTo learn about Bubba, who he actually was and what he cared about, it’s important to meet his church family, and the best place to do that is here, at David White’s dinner table. Here is where so many people have broken bread and laughed and carried on. Here is also where the trustees and deacons held an emergency meeting the Saturday morning after Bubba died to figure out if and how the church would continue. Lori White made biscuits and coffee, and a somber group sat around this table to plan the next day’s service, which is about all they had in them to do. One service at a time. Get through Sunday, then give some thought to the funeral.\n\nIt was decided White would lead the service the next day. He is an easy public speaker with a deep familiarity with scripture, and it was not unusual for him to offer a sermon. Bubba was eager to share his pulpit with speakers he saw as more talented than himself, and White had already been scheduled to do the talk that Sunday. But his sermon would need to be very different now. From there, he and Dan Elkins would share pastoral duties, and other area clergy—even including a Methodist pastor named Laura Eason—would be invited in to help keep the church going.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON The evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1-6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death.\n\nTo keep going is the point of a church. Just as White and his family are fed at this table, so too are they fed at the church across the way. The need for spiritual sustenance doesn’t explain why we believe what we believe, but the two are intimately related, as with common purpose comes community. Coming together in awe and doubt in the face of eternity might be the last human feeling that AI can’t take from us. If a religion splits over a breach in heavenly doctrine or earthly politics or a combination of the two—as the Baptist church did in 1845, cleaved down the middle due to the belief held by what would become Southern Baptists that slavery was an “institution of heaven”—then the community splits, too, profoundly and perhaps irrevocably. The Southern Baptists are no longer confined to the South and now have churches in forty-one states, which makes them the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, church leaders apologized for the faith’s racist origins and at the same time repented for the church’s opposition to the civil-rights movement and interracial marriage.\n\nThere have been other fault lines more recently, involving the enduring Old Testament penchant of more-conservative Christians to take it upon themselves to cast people into hell, as well as contemporary social issues—whether women can preside over services (an emphatic no in Southern Baptist churches) and whether God loves gay people (the Southern Baptist position might best be described as “hate the sin, love the sinner”).\n\nWhat they all seem to agree on is that the Bible is a well-worn daily instruction manual and not some ancient relic. It is important to White that I understand the First Baptist ethos and the mark that Bubba left on the church in Phenix City.\n\n“Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” he says. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man. But time after time after time, it tells you to love your fellow man. No matter what. That was Bubba’s attitude. It’s the attitude our church shares.”\n\nIt seems an uncontroversial point and a handy distillation of the foremost of the Christian commandments, familiar to anyone with a passing knowledge of the New Testament. All of the gospels enunciate a version of this basic tenet of Christianity, and the Gospel of Mark makes clear that there is “no commandment greater” than to love God and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n“It’s not that complicated,” says White, “although because we are human, we keep pretending not to understand how this is supposed to work. We keep pretending that God intended for us to rough each other up using his Word. Buddy, there but for the grace of God go I. Maybe we don’t cross-dress and that kind of stuff, but we all have our faults, and none of us deserve the harsh judgment of other flawed humans. First and foremost, Bubba Copeland was my friend. I don’t fully understand what was going on with him, in his life and in his home, but I also don’t know that I’m supposed to. I don’t think it’s my business.”\n\nThe evening of November 1, after the 1819 News story had broken, Bubba led his last Bible study at First Baptist. He chose a fateful passage to teach: Psalm 23:1–6, which had him walking through the valley of the shadow of death. After the session, he walked into a very tense meeting of the church’s board of trustees that began in anger and ended two hours later in tears and hugs. The trustees, led by White, had, like everyone else, been blindsided by the story and just wanted to know one thing: Bubba, is it true?\n\nHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . .\n\nYes, the pictures were real, he told them. They were private and never meant to be public. It was dumb to post them on the Internet. He was abjectly sorry for the embarrassment he would cause, adding that he would never purposely do anything to hurt the church or his friends.\n\nHe restoreth my soul . . .\n\n“We did not suspend him. We did not reprimand him. We did not fire him,” White says. “We talked to him frankly. We expressed our shock and disappointment, and then we replaced that with our concern and our love and our support for our brother, who was suffering. The church would be fine. Now it was Bubba we were worried about.”\n\nI will fear no evil, for thou art with me . . .\n\nThe next morning, one of the trustees from First Baptist who had been in the meeting the night before received a call from a man from the Russell County Baptist Association. The caller wanted to know what First Baptist planned to do to punish its pastor and why it hadn’t done so already.\n\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . . .\n\nThe First Baptist trustee told the caller from the Baptist Association that as First Baptist had not been aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention for decades, the situation with Bubba Copeland was none of the association’s business.\n\nThou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over . . .\n\nThe trustee added that just as the New Testament instructs in the books of Matthew, Luke, and Galatians, when a brother goes astray, as Paul wrote in his letter to the early Christians of Galatia, “you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.”\n\nSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.\n\nMatthew emphasizes that this counseling should be done privately; Luke, the importance of forgiveness after repentance. And that, the trustee told the caller, was how First Baptist planned to address the situation with its brother Bubba Copeland. Thank you for calling.\n\nAndrew Hetherington Phenix City is roughly half Black and half white, and the town’s diversity is reflected in the First Baptist congregation. “Our philosophy is this: We open those doors,” says David White. “You can read your whole Bible, and nowhere in it does the Bible give you permission to judge your fellow man.”\n\n“We haven’t been Southern Baptist for twenty years,” White says. “And you’re probably not going to find another Baptist church in a small town anywhere that has gay couples that come to church every Sunday. Of course, you have to be sensitive, because we have members that are old-school, in their eighties and nineties, and they might not be ready for all of that, but they’re accepting. After Gene Langner died, we started looking for a pastor. I was on the search committee that brought the next pastor here, and we had people in church that were gay. It was generally known but not discussed. And the older members, some of them—the staunchest, most Republican, redneck guys, I mean—I grew up around them and I watched God change them, but they’re still very conservative. And more than one of them came up to me and said, You’re looking for a pastor, but, you know, so-and-so sits over there in the third row. They’re kind of different. Don’t you bring anybody here that’ll hurt them or turn them away.”\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention still regards sexual difference as an abomination against God, and even homosexual desire not acted on is “always sinful, impure, degrading, shameful, unnatural, indecent and perverted,” according to the denomination’s “Resolution on Homosexual Marriage.” As a remedy for impure thoughts, the SBC endorses sexual reorientation.\n\nWhen Dan Elkins had his country church in southern Alabama and was struggling to reconcile his ministry with his sexuality, he came out to his then wife. That was 1996, and it would be seven years before they would divorce. “We did counseling, and I was told, You can beat this with prayer and fasting, and I prayed, and I fasted, for years—ever the good little Baptist boy—but I was earnestly trying to change something that simply can’t be changed,” Elkins says. “I had come out to a confidant at church, and that person betrayed my trust and it got out in the community, but I didn’t know it. We showed up for church one Wednesday night and the parking lot was full, and I’m like, Something’s going on. This was January 2002. Oh my word. If Facebook had been around then, I’m not sure I’d be here. I’m not sure that I would have seen the way out. Like Bubba couldn’t see the way out.”\n\nIn this pocket of East Alabama, though, the church doors are open, and the Bibles say that God loves everybody. “That’s how this church has evolved,” says White. “We have members who are gay and married and accepted, and that’s relatively new. And we have older members who are accepting even if they don’t understand. It’s been a long trip for them. You cannot fail to recognize how far they’ve come.\n\n“And that’s Bubba’s legacy,” White adds. “I can tell you that his legacy is not defined by that week. His legacy is defined by the friends he leaves, by the people that he led to the Lord, by the life and values he lived. That’s his legacy. Not 1819 News. 1819 News is to journalism what a quack is to the practice of medicine.”\n\nBryan Dawson believes in redemption narratives. Especially his own. The founder of 1819 News (so named because 1819 is the year Alabama became a state) has a compelling personal story that he has honed into a performance piece on various podcasts and pulpits across Alabama for the past several years, although he is not from the state or even the South.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON When a high school student in Smiths Station took her own life, Bubba started a suicide-prevention campaign, putting up affirmations all over town.\n\nAs a young man, Dawson lived in Colorado Springs, and it’s there that his life of crime gave him the material for his story. He trafficked in weed, cocaine, and meth; was the kingpin of a “motorcycle, automobile theft ring”; and in spring 2007 beat a “snitch” over the head with a chain with a padlock at the end of it, for which he would be charged with attempted murder, among other felonies. (He would eventually plead to reduced charges and receive a sentence of sixteen years in prison.) These experiences have been memorialized numerous times in the press, in stories such as “From Breaking Bad to Redemption: The Story of Bryan Dawson” in Newsweek and in an interview on his own website titled “From Tragedy to Triumph, the CEO of 1819 News Shares His Story.”\n\nIn his story, he tells of a sad and lonely young man with no self-esteem raised in a broken home, who is always put in the “friend zone” by young women and who only ever feels comfortable as himself when he is high or drunk. And then he becomes a violent criminal, faces hundreds of years in prison, is extended grace and kindness over and over again by strangers and the state, finds God, and is ultimately salvaged by a community that forgives him seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21–22). In the details and framing of his story, Dawson is pleading for understanding, and his adoring interviewers give it to him; one even adds at the end, “I think if you had been born way back, you would be in the Bible.”\n\nYes, you might say that Dawson’s Colorado Springs redemption epic is like Saul on the road to Damascus, if Saul had attempted to murder a man with a padlock on a chain, causing “permanent disfigurement,” according to the attending physician in a police report, who added that “the victim was lucky to be alive.”\n\nSaul of course repents, calls himself the “foremost of sinners,” and becomes Paul, the greatest writer of the New Testament. In his redemption narrative, Dawson also becomes a different person, but when he tells his story this new person doesn’t mention the man he tried to kill, doesn’t indicate how he feels about him or whether he ever thinks about how he might be getting on with his permanent disfigurement. Instead, in his redemption story, Dawson occasionally shines a little light on his supporting cast—his wife, his mother—but mostly he finds satisfaction in the power of his own narrative. His interviewers feel the same way, and they interrupt him to say things like It’s just like in the movies!\n\nSARA PALCZEWSKI/OPELIKA-AUBURN NEWS/AP (COPELAND). MARK WARREN (SIGN). JULIE BENNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES/REDUX (MEMORIAL) Left: The memorial in front of the church in the days after Bubba killed himself. Right: One of the signs with affirmations that Bubba put up around Smiths Station after a local high school student took her own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to his fresh start in Alabama, where he grew an apostolic beard, started to allow the slightest bit of a twang in now and then, joined a Baptist church in Wetumpka where he sometimes preached from the Old Testament and where just ten days before his life intersected with Bubba Copeland’s he delivered a sermon that revealed him to be an aspiring theocrat. Preaching from Deuteronomy and Samuel, he refers to “God’s government”; is entranced by the “rod of correction,” the “power of the sword,” and offenses against God that are “punishable by death”; warns of the consequences that will come when a church “neglects to use the sword properly”; and says things like “We’ve done a great job of rooting out the rubbish and the refuse of the Philistines in our church. We’ve done a phenomenal job” and “Right now in the state the fear of God is not before their eyes, so they just do whatever they want.”\n\nAppearing on a podcast this past January about the “Dangers of Progres­sive Christianity,” Dawson said that “progressive Christianity comes from feminism creeping into the church” and that the one true faith had fallen victim to “soccer moms” and their tendency to be more welcoming and less judgmental. In the same broadcast, he trained particular fire on a prominent evangelical minister who had sparked controversy by advocating that churches be more supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. For this, Dawson called the minister an “apostate” and a “full-blown heretic” and then went on to improvise that the man was gay and was cheating on his wife, and to finish the point he said, “I wish there were Old Testament lightning strikes that happen to people when they blaspheme the Lord the way that he does.”\n\nThe Lord did not bless Bryan Dawson with a talent for public speaking, but what he lacks in fire he makes up for in brimstone. His Christianity seems somewhat unfamiliar with its namesake. In that, he is a familiar figure, older than time, and not only among Christians—a religious enforcer who knows just enough of a holy book to be dangerous. You might say that he put down his padlock, picked up his Bible, and didn’t skip a beat.\n\nDawson then merged his brutal version of the Christian faith with the often brutal politics of Alabama on the always brutal platform of the Internet and in late 2021 founded 1819 News to counter the most prominent news site in Alabama, AL.com, which is, he says, “communist propaganda.”\n\nThese details of Dawson’s story are important, because in the moral calculus of 1819 News, Bryan Dawson is allowed a redemption narrative sanitized of victims, but Bubba Copeland is not. Perhaps that is because Dawson’s violent felonies were manly crimes, just like in the movies, whereas Bubba Copeland’s transgressions were of thought and behavior that Dawson could not square with his version of the faith and would not tolerate, and rather than extend Copeland the grace that he himself had been the beneficiary of so many times, he ignored Bubba’s plea for mercy and leveled him instead. He and his editor in chief, Jeff Poor—an alum of the Daily Caller and a regular contributor to Breitbart—would make the case that it was Bubba Copeland, who did not preach violence from his pulpit, who was the dangerous one. After his death, they would assert publicly that he was a troubled man, that he had victims, that it was their duty to expose him, and that, as Poor would say, “the people at First Baptist Church, Phenix City, had a right to know what their worship leader was doing.”\n\nOn the day that Bubba Copeland took his own life, 1819 News published its second feature on his fantasy life online. This story was even more lurid than the first, detailing pieces of erotic fiction that Bubba had posted as his alter ego. Some of the fiction was gruesome—one story in particular dealt with a trans protagonist who stalked and killed a woman so that she could have a relationship with her victim’s husband. The story was titled “Dangerous Obsession”: “In my cubicle I scanned her page. She posted a new picture! Excited I screenshot it to add to my ever-growing collection. To say I was a stalker would be a bit of an understatement. Every post she made I studied it, analyzing and taking notes of her daily routine. What she ate, what she drank, from her favorite coffee to her favorite alcoholic drink. Her life had become my obsession.”\n\nIn the two days since 1819 News had posted its first story, it had been alerted that Bubba had used pictures of at least two real people from the Phenix City area in at least one of his posts—a meme about transitioning. The two were a brother and sister, and people from the community have confirmed for me that the brother was a minor when the picture that Bubba used was taken. In his second feature, correspondent Craig Monger wrote that the father of the children pictured had called 1819 News, informed the site that the pictures were of his children, and asked them to remove the images. (The photo of the boy was taken from the father’s social-media account.) In his posts, Bubba seemed to use photos from the Internet both purposefully and indiscriminately, once including an image of a teenage girl who was not from the area.\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Lisa Deason worked with Bubba in the Smiths Station mayor’s office. She engaged in a physical strug­gle with him in a vain effort to keep him from ending his life.\n\nA local woman had contacted the site to say that Bubba had used pictures of her in some of his posts. Monger also discovered that Bubba had used the name of another local woman in “Dangerous Obsession.” I reached out to the father of the brother and sister but did not hear back, and also to both of the women. One did not reply, the other wrote back, “No need to bring all of that back up as those . . . families heal.”\n\nWhen Dawson and Poor had published their exposé on Bubba two days earlier, the 1819 News editorial team had apparently not been aware that he had used the names and images of people he knew in posting to his online community. But in the days after his death, his poor judgment would become their justification for having published the stories in the first place. 1819 News’s initial imperative—to expose a cross-dressing pastor that its editorial team had assumed to be a hypocrite—would no longer be enough.\n\nThe week after Bubba’s suicide, Dawson and Poor released a thirty-­four-minute video podcast on which they outlined all that had gone into their decision to publish their exposé. The timeline, they say, is that they received a tip about Bubba’s online life on Monday, October 30. They called him for comment. They published on Wednesday morning after deliberating for three hours the night before on whether to go through with it.\n\nIn the video, the two strike a sober pose. “It’s a tragic situation where no one wins,” says Dawson. They grant themselves absolution for doing the right thing and say that they feel besieged by criticism on social media that 1819 News had acted irresponsibly. Dawson does not allow himself to understand the reaction in anything other than ideological terms. “This story,” he says, “has shaken things up in the leftist community!”\n\nPoor wears the look of a man surprised to find himself in the middle of a matter of such consequence and bristles at the suggestion that decisions he was party to might have contributed to the death of a man. Don’t assume that Bubba Copeland killed himself because of those stories, he says. “We may never know, but don’t assume that.”\n\nAs they hash out their reasons, Dawson and Poor repeatedly refer to “Dangerous Obsession,” acknowledging that the story is fantasy while nonetheless treating it as if it were evidence of real conduct. Poor becomes exercised and shouts, “What if people don’t ever find out about this? What if it just is allowed to continue on into the future?” And then, with no apparent basis in fact for saying so, he adds this: “We don’t know what else is out there—don’t assume that there’s nothing else out there. This behavior does raise a lot of unanswered questions. . . . I think maybe a little caution here is warranted.”\n\nSix days after Bubba Copeland killed himself and his family and community had been devastated, the editor in chief of 1819 News began to urge caution while continuing to assassinate his character.\n\nNear the end of their podcast, Poor says that although he was “not celebrating the death of Bubba Copeland,” he was “at peace” with the decision to publish.\n\nIt’s easy to see that Bubba was wrong and crossed an ethical line in using the names and images of people he knew in his fiction and other posts. One can only assume that it must have been an awful experience for those two women and the father of that brother and sister to be unexpectedly swept up in this story. But in this Alabama skirmish in a hellish culture war—over gender and speech and objective reality itself—with its dehumanized politics and competing conceptions of heaven, suffused with rage and loss and bereft of much clarity, two things are clear: First, 1819 News wanted the whole world to see Bubba’s posts, without fully understanding what they contained. Before posting its stories, the editorial team there also didn’t seem to know much beyond the few facts they had discovered, things they saw as sensational and repugnant. And second, Bubba Copeland was desperate for his hidden life to remain hidden and never intended for anyone other than perhaps his wife and the other pseudonymous members of his online community to see his posts. He was shattered at the sudden collision of his private and public identities and killed himself.\n\nThe last story 1819 News published about Bubba Copeland came on November 11, eight days after his death. It was a short essay in support of the editorial decision to run the stories, and its conclusion was that Bubba had completed “his rejection of God’s laws” because he had “murdered himself.”\n\nI wrote to 1819 News four times, asking to discuss the stories it published about Bubba Copeland. I did not receive a reply.\n\n\n\nHe gave himself the nickname, as he didn’t much care for “Fred Copeland Jr.” and thought that “Bubba” sounded friendly. He was a standout linebacker for the Smiths Station high school football team, but his real passion in school had been acting in drama productions, because, as he would tell his son, “you can become someone else for a moment.”\n\nWhen he and his first wife, Merrigail, were dating, Bubba sat her down one night and said he had something to tell her. “Have you heard of transgender?” he asked her.\n\n“Bubba, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she answered. He explained it as best he could, and then Merrigail asked, “Why are we talking about this?”\n\n“Well, I dabble in that,” he said. “There have been times that I have dressed up.”\n\nThe news threw Merrigail, but the attraction between them was so strong that she thought their relationship could withstand anything. The couple were married in 1997, and she would soon come to believe that Bubba had a compulsion that he couldn’t control. When they’d been married for a year or so, they decided to buy a dog. When the day came to pick up the dog, Bubba was working, and so Merrigail and her father, Pastor Langner, walked out to the garage to get some rope to secure a large crate. When she opened up the tool chest on Bubba’s truck, she found that it was full of women’s clothes. Merrigail turned to her father. “Dad, I don’t want to embarrass him,” she said.\n\n“I won’t,” her father said.\n\nA few years later, when she was pregnant with their son Carter, she discovered some “transgender stuff” on his computer one afternoon. When Bubba got home from work, he found Merrigail crying. He apologized profusely, saying that the stress at work was too much for him and that dressing up was an escape. “I’ll try to do better,” he told Merrigail. She knew how bad her husband’s stress was. Bubba worked with his father, who, she felt, “talked to him like he was a dog.” Fred Sr. was a hard man, a combat veteran who had returned from Vietnam and made his fortune in the grocery business in Georgia and Alabama. Bubba would often come home saying that he wanted to do something different with his life.\n\nMerrigail’s father told her, “Sweetheart, he can’t help it. This is who he is.” Langner would counsel his son-in-law with compassion, saying, “Bubba, Christ didn’t come into this world for us to be two people. You can only live one life. You need to decide which life you’re going to lead.”\n\nBY ANDREW HETHERINGTON Mechanics­ville Cemetery, where Bubba would often go to meditate when he was troubled and needed to “calm down.”\n\nIn East Alabama, though, Bubba couldn’t imagine a world where he could be himself in a way that people would accept. The marriage broke down, and when the couple divorced in 2009, Bubba was so despondent that he seriously contemplated suicide. One morning, when Carter was eight years old, he found his father sitting on the floor in the shower, sobbing. “I said, ‘Dad, are you okay? I love you,’ ” Carter remembers. “And he said, ‘I’m okay, buddy. I just need a second.’ ” There’s a nineteenth-century cemetery—Mechanicsville Cemetery, it’s called—near the grocery store Bubba owned, and he would sometimes go there to think when he was troubled. After dropping Carter off with the babysitter, Bubba went to the cemetery, intending to kill himself. He had the barrel of a handgun in his mouth when his phone rang. It was an old friend from town, who told Bubba, “Hey, buddy. The Lord put you on my heart, and I just wanted to tell you I love you.”\n\nThe call stopped Bubba. But his torment would continue.\n\nAfter the divorce, Carter lived mostly with his father and attended the Glenwood School in Smiths Station, a private Christian academy. Bubba was a devoted father, and in the years before he met Angela, his life revolved around Carter. Two things happened in the years before Bubba remarried that would define the relationship between father and son. When he was twelve, Carter came across a digital camera in his father’s closet full of pictures of Bubba dressed in women’s clothes. “This is not something that I ever wanted you to find out,” Bubba told his son.\n\n“I just need to know if you’re doing something really wrong, Dad,” Carter replied.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Bubba answered. “This has been a hobby of mine for a while. It’s my escape.”\n\nWhen Merrigail found out that her son had discovered his father’s secret, she said, “Your dad is an incredible man. Don’t let this change the way that you feel about him.” It didn’t. In fact, it gave Carter the feeling that he could talk to his father about anything.\n\nTwo years later, when Carter was a freshman in high school, he told his father that he was gay and that he was struggling with how to live honestly at school and in the world. He wanted to be free to be himself. God had made him this way. Why would he hide who he was? His father was afraid for Carter and angry that he couldn’t talk him out of coming out publicly. He knew what would happen to him, doing so at such a young age in such a small town, and the two fought bitterly. Bubba wanted him to wait until college to come out, wanted him to go far away, be happy, live his life. Carter decided instead to come out to a cherished teacher who betrayed him to a school administrator, who called Carter into his office and told him that he was going to hell. Once the news spread, Carter experienced what felt like torture. Students would spit on him in the bathroom, throw food at him in the lunchroom, and threaten to physically attack him. The teachers were of no help, as they now hated him, too. There was no safe harbor for the gay kid at the Christian school.\n\nThere is nothing like being the singular locus of a compounding hatred, in a closed system that justifies the hatred and calls it good. After school one day, Carter went home, his head full of monsters, and he swallowed a bottle of pills. And then he walked into his favorite room, the family library with its cathedral ceilings, and lay on the floor and looked up and watched the ceiling fan turn. His father found him there, saw the empty pill bottle, and dragged him to the bathroom, where he put his fingers down Carter’s throat.\n\nIt would be the first of several suicide attempts for Carter. Time after time, his father would save him. And the last time, Bubba just held Carter and told him, “God loves you, Carter. And I love you, too. Don’t listen to those people at school. There’s nothing wrong with you. The only thing wrong with you is the judgment of the world.”\n\n“And then he said this: ‘Carter, if I can survive this, you can survive this, too.’ And we made a pact with each other that day that we would live. We would make ourselves happy, we would make others happy, we would live fulfilled lives. And as long as one of us had to do it, the other had to do it, too. ‘No suicides. Promise?’ ”\n\nCarter says now that he realizes that by coming out when he did, he was trying to show his father that it’s okay, that you can be who you are. It’s all right.\n\n“I had reached a point in my life where I had begun to accept myself,” he says. “I had finally gotten to that point, and now my own father had to go through it. And the people that hated me and wanted me to be morally punished were the same people that took my dad from me.”\n\n\n\nAndrew Hetherington A memorial to Bubba, which was unveiled on March 26, 2024. Part of the Smiths Station memorial sidewalk, the marker is located in front of the Historic Jones Store Museum, a local heritage project that he had championed and that opened in 2019.\n\nIt was the afternoon of Friday, November 3, 2023. The last hour of Bubba Copeland’s life. For days, those who knew him best and loved him most had encircled him, lifting him up, trying to hold tight to keep him from slipping away. Their efforts had seemed to be working. Earlier that day, Bubba had gotten a couple new tires for one of his cars, he’d stopped by the government center in Smiths Station to pick up his new city credit card, he’d checked in at the country market. He’d also sent a long and heartfelt letter to the congregation of First Baptist, thanking them for Pastor Appreciation Day, in which he seemed to see a future. “I look forward to continuing our journey of faith, growth, and service together,” he’d written. Now he’d gone missing. In Auburn, Carter Copeland received a call from his stepmother, Angela. “Your dad just called me. And he said that he loves me and that he’s always loved me and to go to my parents’ house. And then the call dropped off, and now every time I call him, it goes straight to voicemail. I don’t know what to do, Carter. You know him better than anybody. Where is he?”\n\nBy then, the Lee County sheriff’s department had fanned out all over the county to find Bubba and make sure he was okay. It wasn’t just law enforcement, either—Bubba’s friends and family had also begun searching for him, and as Carter ran to his car to make the drive from Auburn, Lisa Deason, who had worked as Bubba’s communications director in Smiths Station, had gone looking for him, too, and was pulling up at Bubba’s house. Deason had helped him draft letters of resignation as mayor and pastor just the day before. The letter resigning from his position as pastor read, in part, “Admittedly, there have been instances where my wife and I have taken private pictures within the confines of our home, which should have never been shared online. I realize this was a significant lapse in judgment and a personal failure, for which I bear complete and absolute responsibility. . . . I apologize for any distress or humiliation my actions may have caused. Love to all, Bubba.” The letter would never be sent.\n\nLike many of his other friends, Deason had been urging Bubba to get out of town for a few days, let the Internet find somebody else to destroy, let things blow over. That morning, though, 1819 News had dropped its second feature on Bubba and, mesmerized by the coverage on his phone, he had started telling people that he didn’t know if he could go on. The night before, Dan Elkins and Jason Price had had a long talk with Bubba about his growing despair, and Elkins had asked him, “Bubba, where are your guns?” Bubba said that he had surrendered his handgun to a safety officer in Smiths Station. As several of his friends would say, though, he lives in the South and his name is Bubba—he’s got more than one gun.\n\nThe latest 1819 News piece seemed to break something in Bubba, unleashing a lethal shame, and by that afternoon his phone was as dangerous a weapon as his gun.\n\nNot finding Bubba at home, Deason stood in the driveway of his house and called 911, saying that her friend was suicidal, and at that moment, his Tahoe pulled up in front of the house on Oakhurst Drive. He got out and left the motor running. “What are you doing here?” he asked her.\n\n“I came to check on you.”\n\n“Who’s with you?”\n\n“I’m by myself.”\n\n“Do not tell Angela where I am. I mean it. Don’t you tell a soul where I am.”\n\nBubba went into the house for no more than thirty seconds, and when he came out he was walking fast and moved to get back in his truck. “I love you,” he told Deason, “but I got to go.”\n\nShe said, “No, I’m not going to let you do this, Bubba! Please don’t do this. You have way more people that love you than you can even imagine. Don’t do this. Don’t do this to your family. Please. Don’t.” Deason was sobbing now and trying to hold on to Bubba, with her arms wrapped around him. No, I’m not letting you leave. Realizing she couldn’t restrain him, she let go, ran around him, jumped into the driver’s seat, turned off the ignition, and grabbed the steering wheel. I’m not going to let you leave.\n\n“I’m going to do it in front of you if you don’t move,” he said. Bubba pulled her out of the truck, and in desperation, she was thinking, What the hell can I do? In that instant, 911 called back, and instead of the operator, it was Jeff Pitts with the sheriff’s department on the line.\n\n“What’s going on?” Pitts asked.\n\n“He’s trying to leave and he won’t listen to me! He’s adamant. He says he’s got to end it.”\n\n“Let me talk to him.”\n\n“Bubba, it’s Major Pitts, Jeff Pitts.”\n\n“Jeff, man, I love you,” Bubba said. “But I’m done. I can’t do this no more.”\n\nBubba handed the phone to Deason, got in his truck, and peeled away.\n\nAs he drove, a cousin who had joined the search pulled up behind him. Bubba told him, If these deputies make me stop, you’re going to see something that I do not want you to see.\n\nCarter was driving 100 miles per hour toward Mechanicsville Cemetery, because he knew his father might be there. He called his father’s number over and over. Nothing. And then his father called him.\n\n“I love you, buddy,” Bubba said. “I’ve lived my whole life to make sure that you are successful and that you have what you need. And I just want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world.”\n\n“I knew immediately what that meant,” Carter says. “And I just said, ‘Please, Dad, please tell me you’re not doing what I think you’re doing. Please, we can get through this.’ ”\n\n“It’s too late, son. I love you. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“I told him, ‘You have nothing to be sorry about. There’s nothing to be sorry for. I love you. You’re my hero. Always will be. This is going to be horrible. We’ll get through it.’ ”\n\n“I’m sorry. This is what I have to do. This is the only way out.”\n\nCarter remembers feeling desperate to hold on, desperate to find the words that would make his father stay, desperate. He screamed at the top of his lungs and felt a rush of emotion such that he thought his vocal cords might explode. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! “I screamed it as loud as I could for as long as he was on the line, because I knew he was listening. I knew. I could see he was still on the call. I kept screaming. That’s all I knew to say was, I love you! It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay!”\n\nAnd then silence.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Bubba’s death, along a country road in the town of Beulah, Lee County sheriff Jay Jones took possession of his electronic devices, and his office searched them for evidence of criminal conduct. They found none. “In my view, Bubba Copeland would never intentionally do anything to harm anyone,” Jones told me. “I just don’t think that he was that type of person.”\n\nDavid White would write a new sermon for the Sunday after Bubba’s death, staying up well past midnight the night before, sitting at his dinner table, writing in longhand. He would preach Psalm 23:1–6, just as Bubba had in his last service. And he wanted to make sure the world knew that the church had remained true to its pastor and always would. “Despite what may have been implied in the media,” he wrote, “members of this church have been steadfast in their love and concern for our pastor.”\n\nWe all have things that we don’t want other people to know about us. Things that might be hard to explain, even to ourselves. The First Baptist Church of Phenix City did not abandon Bubba Copeland, even after learning the secrets that he might not have been able to explain even to himself.\n\nBubba’s body would be turned away by the two Baptist cemeteries in Smiths Station, his hometown, the town that he loved. He is buried in a private family plot many miles away.\n\nAs I finished my reporting for this story, I took to asking the people in Bubba’s life what they might say to the people at 1819 News if they had the chance. Several told me that they are required to love them and will be praying for them. As Bubba Copeland always said, “God loves you, and so do we.”\n\n",

        "content": "By a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a lower court ruling that would force the president to release $2 billion in previously appropriated USAID money. This, of course, was a ruling that confounds the basic business plan that has guided the president through his entire career—namely, stiff your creditors and dare them to sue. It turns out that the agencies of the government may be more formidable opponents than the gardeners and glaziers of New Jersey. From The Washington Post:\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court’s three liberal justices in the 5-4 order, which was the high court’s first significant move on lawsuits related to President Donald Trump’s initiatives in his second term. … As is customary in emergency orders, the majority did not explain the reasoning for its decision. It directed the lower court to clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to global health groups, with consideration of the “feasibility of any compliance timelines.” Soon after the ruling, U.S. district Judge Amir H. Ali ordered the government to develop a timeline to restart the payments.\n\nThe primary dissenter was Justice Sam Alito, who seems to be a bit confused about how this whole judicial system is supposed to work:\n\nDoes a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? The answer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No,’ but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned.\n\nThat parenthetical is a bit of typical Alito snottery. The money in question represents payment for work that already has been done. Alito’s assertion that the money is something “probably lost” is a barely camouflaged assertion that the money somehow was not earned by the people doing USAID work around the world. This is money that literally will save lives around the world. Alito’s petulance is not only tasteless, but also, in the most profound way, it is inhumane.\n\nI wish the majority had issued a formal argument for why it ruled the way that it did. Not having done so leaves the Alito dissent as the only formal stated argument for the record—an odd position for the argument that did, after all, lose. But once again, justices Barrett and Roberts seem to be gingerly stepping around the crude Trumpist version of the unitary executive theory. I have no idea of the depth of Roberts’s tortured judicial conscience, but Justice Barrett seems to be finding her feet as a kind of wild-ish card in the deck. You find the sunshine where you can.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "There are other courthouses in other places. They’re not in Washington. They’re the repair shops of the law. They hammer out the dents that result from the collisions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. And they’re where the law comes closest to Atticus Finch’s optimism. They’re where the leveling happens. —Something I Wrote Once\n\n\n\nLong ago, I learned a valuable lesson about verdicts in criminal cases. The lesson conforms to the late William Goldman’s classic assessment of Hollywood: Nobody Knows Anything. This is especially true in that tremulous time between when the case goes to the jury and when the jury comes back with a verdict. Once, while covering a political-corruption case at The Boston Phoenix, we killed that time in the best possible way. Somebody got up a poker game in the press room. (Heavens to Hildy Johnson!) At one point, a court officer poked his head in to remind us that gambling in a federal courthouse was, you know, non-legal. “Yeah, right,” we replied. “I’ll raise you a quarter.”\n\nRelated Story The Truth About Trump That Only the Courts See\n\nThe chatter over the nickels and dimes was all about what the extended deliberations “meant.” This is the oldest sucker’s bet in journalism. Nobody can tell what twelve individual minds can divine from the evidence presented, let alone how they can come to agree unanimously on what that evidence proves one way or another. Nobody knows anything, and only a fool would bet on it. (Brief Historical Note: The jury in that trial came back quickly, and the defendant was acquitted. I came away half a buck ahead.)\n\nWhen the jury—and, therefore, the System—brought down the ten-pound hammer on the former president* Thursday afternoon, it also shattered much of the instant, freeze-dried speculation. There was no acquittal. There was no hung jury. There was no “mixed verdict.” There were thirty-four felony counts and there were thirty-four guilty verdicts, and it took the jury less than a day to bring that gravid judgment back. I would never call their job easy. There were death threats in the air throughout the trial. There were thick clouds of squid ink billowing from the defense table. And the defendant was formerly the president* of the United States. But when the jury left the courtroom and went in back to deliberate, all extraneous ballyhoo evidently fell away and all the crooked places were made straight. Left alone with the evidence and their own common sense, the members of the jury brought strength and clarity to the proceedings, to themselves, and, one hopes fervently, to the country as well.\n\nThe Executive was crooked. The national legislature was inert. And the independent judiciary, at its most common level, stepped up and did its job. This is how that whole “separation of powers” thing was designed to work. Now we can only hope that a good New York jury and a brave New York judge have shamed the Supreme Court into tossing the spurious “executive immunity” claim onto the ash heap where it belongs and that, down in Florida, Judge Aileen (Slow Loris) Cannon will take a lesson from Juan Merchan on what being a judge is supposed to be about.\n\nDonald Trump is a convicted felon. Stormy Daniels is an American hero. And a little porn star shall lead them.\n\nCase closed, motherf*ckers.\n\nRelive the Magic: More Charlie on Trump’s Hush-Money Trial",

For the man sent to prison as a boy for something he didn’t do. Does anyone ever allow the reality of a false accusation to sink in and upset the equilibrium for even a moment, or is it just in and out and on to the next, like everything else? That accusation, after all, was leveled on our behalf. State power is derived from us. Justice is meant to make us whole. But what does an injustice do to us? When an innocent person serves a full prison sentence, gets out carrying the excruciating knowledge that justice is for other people and facts and innocence don’t matter when you’re a kid raised by your mom in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, uptown—Harlem, U. S. A. Spare a thought for the falsely accused.\n\nHe can’t walk down the street for getting stopped by people who have never met him but to whom he is famous. In this neighborhood, the man who was falsely accused is well-known. The elders have known him for decades, since he was a tall, skinny kid with a flattop, on the front page of all the papers. The city was coming apart in 1989—you could’ve lit the air with a match, the racial tension was that combustible. And the crime that he was accused of committing was so terrible that once he and his codefendants were identified to the public on the word of the police, the case was over before it even began. White victim, a young professional out for a jog in Central Park, raped and beaten nearly to death with a tree branch, three quarters of the blood in her body soaked into the ground. The accused were Black and brown, five of them, aged fourteen to sixteen, four confessing on videotape. What more is there to know? New York in the aftermath was a tinderbox, braying for justice, instead finding vengeance, which is supposed to belong only to God, according to God Himself.\n\nRead We are celebrating our 90th anniversary with a wildly ambitious package called The Next 90. Learn more about it, as well as Esquire’s living legacy, in this letter from Editor-in-Chief Michael Sebastian.\n\nA local man who had inherited a real estate fortune even took out full-page ads in all the local papers calling for the state to bring back the death penalty, writing: “What has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police for those who break the law . . . ?”\n\nBut that was a lifetime ago, and so some others here in Harlem seem to recognize the falsely accused man not as Yusef Salaam of the Central Park Five but as Yusef Salaam, current candidate for public office, running to represent Harlem on the New York City Council. He’s not yet even in office, but the expectation invested in him is daunting. On the street, Harlemites are taking him in, greeting him with broad smiles and queuing up for selfies, bumping elbows and shaking hands, happy that this gracious man of forty- nine has not only come through the time the state stole from him without bitterness but has agreed to be a voice for the ambitions, grievances, and despair of this beautiful, historic, and desperate neighborhood in America’s largest city. He has a ready smile and a welcoming face. “Blessings, blessings, blessings!” he will greet old friends and new. As a politician, he is a complete novice, but for the retail politicking that is the bedrock of democracy—hearing from people on the street where they live—he has a natural gift. He is inexperienced enough at the game that he will stay and talk until you’re done with him. And a city-council district may be democracy in its purest form—big enough to require a proper campaign in order to prove your worth, small enough that an officeholder, especially a rookie, might legitimately feel responsible for every soul and pothole in it.\n\nSalaam likens any neighborhood to a human body, and each of us to cells in the body—if you put healthy, nutritious food into a body and take care to educate the mind, do things in moderation and get good rest, the body will be functioning, flourishing, and happy. If you eat badly or partake in unhealthy habits, do drugs or sleep irregularly, then the body gets sick. Dies. It’s not a bad metaphor for how society works, and it allows for just how interdependent we actually are much more than our current politics does. If some of us are left out or are doing poorly, the health of all of society is put at risk.\n\nThe needs of this body, of Salaam’s neighborhood, are intense. And as he makes his way up and down its streets, from all sides, his fellow Harlemites come to him:\n\n“You know how long it’s been since the senior center had a coat of paint?” says a man holding a cue stick at the Lieutenant Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Center. “And we sure could use another pool table—gives people a place to gather in the evenings. . . .”\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY\n\nThis article appeared in the 90th Anniversary issue of Esquire\n\nsubscribe\n\nA woman buttonholes him at a community meeting at Graham Court, a Gilded Age gem on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard that has seen better days: “What are you going to do about the defecation and the urination that goes on outside my front door?!”\n\n“I applied for affordable housing, but affordable housing ain’t affordable!” says a man who stops him on 135th Street and comes in for a hug. “We need a two-bedroom, and they’ve had us in a studio for twenty years! . . . I sound Black, right?” He is Asian, and points this out by circling his face with his index finger. “People here don’t look like me, but they sure live like me.” He complains to Salaam about the conduct of corrections officers. “But they just scared. I don’t talk from no textbook—I did fifteen years.” As Salaam begins to walk away to his next appointment, the man reaches out for his hand and issues a plea: “You’ve come too far. Don’t sell yourself out.”\n\nAn older woman on 110th Street stops short of asking for his attention, instead holding back as he speaks to a small cluster of people. Her eyes brimming with tears, she clutches your arm and shakes it gently. “I just can’t get over how much time he lost,” she says. “They are so hard on our men.”\n\nYou point to him and say that Salaam somehow seems unbroken by an experience that might well have destroyed him—publicly vilified at fifteen, wrongfully convicted at sixteen, imprisoned for almost seven years in appalling conditions upstate, on parole for three years, required to register as a sex offender for another three. She dabs her eyes with a tissue and shakes her head hopefully.\n\nEvery concern, every conceivable “issue” that a human life encounters finds its way to Salaam on these streets—hunger, housing security, economic insecurity, public safety, public health, lousy landlords, race discrimination, the human capacity to produce trash, the human tendency to triple- park, for starters.\n\nSpare a thought for the city-council candidate. We drive from Central Harlem down toward his old neighborhood at the northeast corner of Central Park, and Salaam is careful not to go a tick over the speed limit. He’s been pulled over during the campaign and is very mindful not to give anyone any excuse to interrupt his peaceful movements. He pulls into a parking space on 110th Street across from Central Park, not a hundred yards from the building he lived in growing up, just a few hundred yards from the spot in the park where the state said he had committed the crime that altered the course of his life. Salaam hops out of the car and walks around to the passenger side, opens the door for his mother, a soft-spoken woman of regal bearing with shoulder-length salt-and-pepper dreadlocks, who steps out onto the sidewalk, into the neighborhood that her son will soon represent on the New York City Council. Yusef starts to walk his mother in the direction of home when a young man, slight and intense and wearing a backpack, approaches him.\n\n“Excuse me,” the young man says. “You’re running for office?”\n\n“Yes,” Salaam says. “I recently won the Democratic primary.” He smiles. “And my opponent in November is apathy.”\n\n“His opponent in November is Write In,” his mother corrects.\n\n“Okay, great,” says the young man. “Let me ask you—what’s the . . . what’s the point?”\n\nSalaam hesitates for just a moment, uncomprehending. “The point of . . .” He leans forward toward the man, as if trying to better pick up his signal. “. . . running for office?\n\n“No,” the young man answers. “I’m out here every two and four years, and I listen to all of you, and I just need to know What’s the point?” He flashes a brilliant smile and projects a crackling energy. There’s a touch of violence in his eyes. In this moment, though, he is intently waiting for an answer.\n\n“Well,” Salaam says, “I believe that in this neighborhood we hold great power that we have never fully exercised. We are too busy dividing ourselves, going after each other—”\n\nThe young man interrupts. “We play by their rules—they play by no rules,” he says. “Oh, they go on about their rules and their Constitution, but when it comes to keeping n***ers down, they just make it up as they go!”\n\n“Okay, okay,” Salaam says. “Now, I know something about them keeping us down.”\n\nIt is pretty clear that the young man doesn’t know who Salaam is. He looks to be about thirty, and although he grew up in Harlem, he likely wasn’t yet born when Salaam was sent to prison. He interrupts again.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve been through some things,” he says. “Well, I’ve experienced some things, too.”\n\nThe air between them bristles.\n\n“Tell me about your life, brother,” Salaam says.\n\nThe young man has a wide view and is well versed in politics, local and national—and he speaks urgently. He also has a specific issue. He sells weed, is an “entrepreneur,” and has been paying keen attention to the city’s pronouncements and actions, as over the past two years, Harlem has steadily filled with smoke shops that are killing his business. “I’m trying to figure out why outsiders are now selling legal marijuana on our streets. These shops aren’t licensed and could be a danger to the public. I want to participate in the legit economy, but these motherfuckers . . .”\n\nSalaam has been watching the young man closely as he flashes rage with his eyes and immediately takes it back with his smile. An astonishing dynamic is emerging on this sidewalk in Harlem. Yusef Salaam, who had every reason to give up on society, or “the system,” or America, is straining to prevent the young man from doing the same. And the young man, well, he is desperate for a reason to believe and is not yet sure that he is finding it.\n\n“Brother, we are trapped inside of someone else’s hundred-year plan,” Salaam says. “The only way to break out of it and make our own plan is together. The only thing I know is that we as a community have never used our power—”\n\n“Is there a we?!” the young man snaps. “Am I a we?” He flashes that smile as he looks inward, momentarily amused by the wordplay. “Who are we?”\n\nAnd then he drops the smile and levels his gaze. “Because I’m not playing—I’m ready to burn this motherfucker down. What is the strategy, and why should I give a shit in the first place? Why be involved?”\n\nSalaam: Because I know enough from when the spike wheels of “justice” ran over me and my family thirty-four years ago that if we are not involved and in numbers, and using our voice to change the world, then they will use our voices against us. Brother, you have to trust me when I say that divided, we won’t stand a chance.\n\nYoung man [more urgently this time]: Hear me out. Do we have to burn it down, or what kind of political changes you talking about?\n\nSalaam: I’m not a politician, brother.\n\nYoung man: Then what are you?\n\nSalaam: I’m you.\n\nNORMAN JEAN ROY The future councilman in Harlem. “There was a saying in my neighborhood: When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do.” He is careful to spell out the word.\n\nThere were twenty boys rampaging in the park that night.\n\nThere were thirty-two. There were forty.\n\nIt was the Central Park Ten.\n\nThe Central Park Six.\n\nThe Central Park Five.\n\nThere was “plenty of physical evidence” linking the five to the attack.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking any of the five to the attack.\n\nThe police interrogations were conducted by the book.\n\nThe defendants were coached, their confessions were coerced, and they were told that if they just admitted involvement in the jogger attack, they could go home.\n\nFor a case that has now been closed twice, there remains a lot in dispute. Well, maybe better to say that some very powerful people cling to a version of events that has since been abandoned as untrue. What is now clear is that the convictions of the Central Park Five were won in spite of grievous flaws in the evidence—perhaps it’s better to say in spite of a grievous lack of evidence. Because what is also now clear is that there was physical or biological evidence connecting only one person to the assault on the jogger that night—a person not among the five defendants. For that night in April 1989, there is no reliable accounting for exactly where those five teenagers were and when, nor exactly what they may or may not have been doing. Maybe better just to say that the Central Park Five didn’t commit the terrible crime for which they were convicted.\n\nWhat is not disputed is that on the night of April 19, 1989, a young investment banker named Trisha Meili was out for a run in Central Park when she was attacked, raped, viciously beaten, and left for dead in the bushes three hundred feet from the park’s 102nd Street crossover. Unconscious and near death, she would be found by passersby at 1:30 a.m.\n\nEarlier that evening, witnesses would tell police that some kids had been assaulting pedestrians near the Central Park reservoir, several blocks south. In response, cops had flooded the park and hauled a large group of teen–agers to the precinct located at the center of Central Park. Among them were fourteen-year-old Raymond Santana and fourteen-year-old Kevin Richardson, who did not know each other. The boys were expecting to be sent home when Meili’s near-lifeless body was found. A call from a detective at Metropolitan Hospital would stop their release and mark the beginning of a legal and social nightmare that would come to be recognized as one of the most shameful failures in the history of American justice.\n\nThe next day, April 20, based on descriptions from the boys already in custody, fifteen-year-old Antron McCray was also questioned by police. No one seems to know for sure how the police came to be looking for Yusef Salaam, but it seems that the cops had a description of another boy—tall kid with a flattop—that sounded like Yusef.\n\nSalaam’s brother Shareef had heard that the police were looking for his brother and begged him not to go outside that afternoon. Salaam’s sister, Aisha, remembers that Shareef, who was bigger than his older brother, wrestled Yusef to the floor to keep him from leaving the apartment. “Aisha!” Yusef yelled. “Get him off of me!” Shareef finally let go of his brother, and Aisha and Yusef took the elevator down to the lobby, where they ran into Yusef’s friend Korey Wise, sixteen, who also lived in the building. The building security guard told them that at least three police officers had just taken the elevator up to the Salaam apartment.\n\nAisha is the oldest of the siblings and says she thought that if she could just talk to the police, they’d understand their mistake. Her brother was a placid young man, averse to physical confrontations, she says. When a mugger once demanded his money, he emptied his pockets without hesitation. Another time, when Yusef was on his bike and a thief approached him and said, “Get off,” Yusef got off.\n\n“Let’s go up and talk to them,” Aisha Salaam remembers telling her brother. Korey Wise went upstairs with his friend and offered to go with Yusef to the precinct to keep him company. Those five—Santana, Richardson, McCray, Salaam, and Wise —would become the Central Park Five.\n\nWhen the police came for Yusef on the evening following the rape and beating of Trisha Meili, they knocked on his apartment door on the twenty- first floor of 1309 Fifth Avenue. Shareef Salaam answered the door in his underwear. Get dressed, you’re coming with us, they told him. What? Why? the confused teenager asked the cops. Are you Yusef Salaam? they asked. That’s my brother, he said. And that, Yusef Salaam says, is how close his brother came to also being a member of the Central Park Five.\n\n“There was a saying in my neighborhood,” Salaam tells me. “When the cops come looking for you, any n-i-g-g-e-r will do,” taking care to spell the word rather than say it.\n\nSharonne Salaam was a single mother who taught fashion design at Parsons School of Design in Greenwich Village. When she got home from work that evening, Aisha and Shareef were both hysterical that the police had taken Yusef in for questioning in connection with the crime that was exploding in the news across the city that day. Sharonne at first thought they were joking. She walked through the apartment, looking in closets and under beds. Okay, that’s enough—you can come out now. When she realized that her oldest son really wasn’t there, Sharonne sat Aisha and Shareef down and said, Calm down and tell me the full story again, from the beginning.\n\n“I was a pariah. They said I was born a mistake. I’m not a mistake,” Salaam tells me. “And I think that what I have been through gives me perspective on what people go through in life. I never thought about politics or holding elective office until recently, but I feel that this—I guess you might call it empathy—will be helpful to me as I serve my community. If, as Nietzsche says, you can find the why, then you can live any how. We all need a reason to live. This is mine. I was supposed to go through what I went through.”\n\nWe are sitting alone in a cluttered little office on 135th Street—a local Democratic club that doubles as his campaign office. There are mismatched photographs of past club officers on the wall, the flooring is peeling, and campaign literature is piled haphazardly on every surface. It was from here that Salaam took on and defeated two establishment candidates in the primary for his council seat. He now has a fully germinated idea of how his story fits into the larger story of loss and struggle and perseverance that defines the Black experience in this town and in this country, and he speaks it in full paragraphs, only occasionally lapsing into the rote poetry of the motivational speaker he now is. “For Black Americans, robbed of our names, our culture, our God, it is just a short step further to lose your mind, too,” he says. “But what if a person doesn’t lose his mind? What if a person instead taps back into the memory in Sankofa, which is the sacred knowledge from your past that enables you to live in your present?”\n\nHe takes special meaning and great comfort from this African concept—Sankofa—of looking back to live forward. With meaning comes purpose, with purpose comes acceptance. So that in part explains how he came through the fire, as his uncle Frank describes the experience. Many people never come through it but instead are consumed by it. The other part was the unstinting support of his mother, his grandmother, his siblings, and his uncle, who is a father figure. Without their belief, he says, he may well have lost his own.\n\nIt was Salaam’s grandmother who told him to find meaning in the tribulation. She told him, “Yusef, I don’t know why they’re doing this to you, but be still and listen.” When he was in prison, she wrote to him every week, addressing the letters to “Master Yusef Salaam,” because she wanted whoever processed the letters to know that her grandson was somebody.\n\nIt was Salaam’s mother who made sure that he did not confess on videotape, and he was the only one of the five who didn’t. It was Salaam’s mother who repeatedly refused consent for police to question Yusef. It was Salaam’s mother who insisted instead that her son be given an attorney and who told him to stop talking to investigators immediately. “She told me: ‘You will not participate in your own destruction,’ ” Salaam says. “They were breaking us down. They would have broken me, too, without my mother.”\n\nAfter his conviction, his mother would keep vigil at the prison, making the trip upstate from the city once or twice a week for the entire six years and eight months that he was incarcerated—to Dannemora, Harlem Valley, wherever they moved him to. She would often switch the days of the week so as to disrupt routine—a sort of surprise inspection, so that prison staff would never know for sure when she might show up. “It was the only way to make sure he stayed alive,” she says. “I had to keep Yusef alive.”\n\nIt was his mother who would call him in 2002 to tell him that the person who had actually committed the crime for which he was convicted—a serial rapist and killer named Matias Reyes—had confessed to the rape and assault of Trisha Meili. By then, Salaam was living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, trying with difficulty to put together some kind of life. Reyes had found Jesus, she told her son. Knew details only a crime’s perpetrator would know. The swabs taken from the victim that night so long ago had immediately matched Reyes’s DNA. Sharonne Salaam delivered this news, and then they both sat in stunned silence on the phone for what seemed like a long time.\n\nSpare a thought for the mother of the falsely accused.\n\nThe young man’s eyes narrow as he processes what Salaam has just said: “The spike wheels of justice ran over your family?” His eyes widen as the identity of the man he’s talking to dawns on him. Not fifty yards from where we stand there is now an entrance to Central Park called the Gate of the Exonerated, dedicated last year as a monument to the falsely accused men, and as an admonition to the unwritten future to do better than we have done. It also stands in stone as a reminder that even in a time defined by our seeming inability to acknowledge error, extend grace, apologize to each other, and correct course, lost truths can still be found and long-delayed justice is not always justice denied. The young man’s shoulders soften, the brilliant smile takes over his face, and he offers Salaam his hand but instead comes in for a hug. If Salaam has reason for hope, the young man seems to concede, how insurmountable could his grievances be?\n\nThe young man walks into the afternoon, and Salaam stands on the street in his old neighborhood, thinking of the exchange and of the challenge of persuading others to believe in a system from which they feel estranged. If anyone understands that, it is Salaam. No one in a position of power and direct responsibility for his indictment, conviction, and imprisonment has apologized or even acknowledged error. When the prosecutor who oversaw the case against the Central Park Five heard of Reyes’s confession and the conclusive evidence of his guilt, she said, “I think Reyes ran with that pack of kids. He stayed longer when the others moved on. He completed the assault. I don’t think there is a question in the minds of anyone present during the interrogation process that these five men were participants not only in the other attacks that night, but in the attack on the jogger.”\n\nThe New York police commissioner ordered a review of the investigation, and the resulting report found the department blameless, asserting despite a paucity of evidence that “it is more likely than not that the defendants participated in an attack upon the jogger.” As if “more likely than not” were an acceptable standard of criminal justice anywhere anyone would want to live.\n\nWhen asked if he regretted placing the ads in all the local papers calling for the death penalty in the wake of the attack, ads that contributed to the toxic atmosphere in New York City and potentially compromised the defendants’ ability to receive fair trials, that real estate heir, Donald Trump, who by then was president of the United States, declined to apologize, saying, “They admitted their guilt.”\n\nSpeaking about this ignominious record, Salaam is encyclopedic. The people who are vested in the false accusation are, he thinks, also the people who remain vested in the notion that it is simply inevitable that people who look like him must eventually wind up in the system. The deference to prison is still that powerful. And it is that matrix that he believes must be broken. Yusef Salaam’s time on earth puts him at the nexus of many things that have come to define American life—our never-healing racial wound, our deeply ingrained antipathy between police and communities of color, and, in the most promising instance, our response to the revanchism of the Trump-led reversion to our worst impulses—in the stubborn hope that we can be and do better by participation in public life.\n\nSalaam is surprisingly light and free of rancor. Appreciates complexity and nuance in an era not known for either. As a budding public servant, for instance, he believes in the police. “We can all be victims of crime,” he says. “Some of us are also victims of the police. That doesn’t mean all policing is bad. It means that we need better policing. I know in an intimate way the cops who get away with doing bad things by saying that they were just doing their job—they were not just doing their job.”\n\nHe doesn’t seem to relish obvious opportunities to settle scores. When asked for a reaction earlier this year after former president Trump was criminally indicted in New York City, Salaam offered a simple one-word response: “Karma.”\n\nAs he stands here on his mother’s street, he contemplates what it might mean to absolve those who resist responsibility for their actions. What does an injustice do to us? The state has the power to condemn, to absolve, to forgive on behalf of society, the people, us. But whose power is it to forgive a recalcitrant state when the state doesn’t possess the grace or wisdom to even seek forgiveness?\n\nIt is a supreme irony of our time that that power belongs to the powerless, to the wronged, to the falsely accused and imprisoned. It belongs to the victims of misused state power. It belongs to Yusef Salaam. It is the most aggrieved who must, it seems, also be the most gracious.\n\nSalaam raises his arms and opens his hands, as if releasing something into the New York sky. “I have had to learn how to forgive. It is the only way I know to repair myself. I have to forgive Donald Trump,” he says, gesturing down Fifth Avenue. “I forgive the prosecutors . . . I forgive the police . . . I forgive those who have threatened me and who told me to watch my back forever. I forgive. I forgive. I forgive.”\n\n\n\nStory: Mark Warren\n\nPhotos: Norman Jean Roy\n\nStyling: Bill Mullen\n\nProduction: Danelle Manthey at Somersault Productions\n\nProduction Design: Michael Sturgeon\n\nTailoring: Joseph Ting\n\nCreative Direction: Nick Sullivan\n\nDesign Direction: Rockwell Harwood\n\nVisuals Direction: Justin O'Neill\n\nExecutive Producer, Video: Dorenna Newton",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to the Last Post of the Week from the Blog’s Favourite Living Canadian)\n\n\n\nIt appears at the moment that the reign of error brought to the government by Elon Musk and the Cargo Shorts Crew may be coming to an end. First of all, the White House is showing signs that it’s run out of patience with Musk’s independent rampage through the executive branch. From The New York Times:\n\nYou have fired “nobody,” Mr. Musk told Mr. Rubio, then scornfully added that perhaps the only person he had fired was a staff member from Mr. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Mr. Rubio had been privately furious with Mr. Musk for weeks, ever since his team effectively shuttered an entire agency that was supposedly under Mr. Rubio’s control: the United States Agency for International Development. But, in the extraordinary cabinet meeting in front of President Trump and around 20 others—details of which have not been reported before—Mr. Rubio got his grievances off his chest.\n\nMr. Musk was not being truthful, Mr. Rubio said. What about the more than 1,500 State Department officials who took early retirement in buyouts? Didn’t they count as layoffs? He asked, sarcastically, whether Mr. Musk wanted him to rehire all those people just so he could make a show of firing them again. Then he laid out his detailed plans for reorganizing the State Department.\n\nLittle Marco Unchained!\n\nCabinet officials almost uniformly like the concept of what Mr. Musk set out to do—reducing waste, fraud, and abuse in government—but have been frustrated by the chain saw approach to upending the government and the lack of consistent coordination. Thursday’s meeting, which was abruptly scheduled on Wednesday evening, was a sign that Mr. Trump was mindful of the growing complaints. He tried to offer each side something by praising both Mr. Musk and his cabinet secretaries. (At least one, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has had tense encounters related to Mr. Musk’s team, was not present.) The president made clear he still supported the mission of the Musk initiative. But now was the time, he said, to be a bit more refined in its approach.\n\nWhen this president resorts to How Things Are Supposed to Work, you know he’s cornered. He and his people have to be aware that Musk and what he’s done, while popular in theory, is incredibly unpopular in specific cases. Republicans in Congress, particularly in the Senate, are beginning to find themselves heated up back home. I mean, some of them even pleaded their case directly to the Porcelain Man himself. From The Washington Post:\n\nThough many Republican lawmakers support Musk’s mission, some have in recent weeks complained about a lack of communication about DOGE plans. Musk told a group of Republican senators in a closed-door lunch that he wanted to set up a direct line for them when they have questions, allowing them to get a near-instant response to their concerns, senators said. Some senators were given Musk’s phone number during Wednesday’s meeting, and the entrepreneur said he would “create a system where members of Congress can call some central group” to get problematic cuts reversed quickly, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) said.\n\nThe meeting was the first sign that, after weeks of burrowing into federal agencies and attempting to lay off hundreds of thousands of federal workers, Musk recognizes he needs Congress’s cooperation to make a lasting impact on U.S. spending. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s ongoing freeze of nearly $2 billion in foreign aid—a decision Musk told the senators he had read.\n\nNice of him to realize we still have a Constitution and all that. Somebody strike his Medal of Freedom. It also seems to matter that his chain-saw routine has begun to result in a noticeable losing streak in the federal courts. In his newsletter, Josh Marshall blows the whistle on the whole DOGE and Pony Show.\n\nBut it remains unclear if Republicans are willing to vote to support Musk. Some lawmakers are worried about the political price they could pay for DOGE, as constituents deluge their offices with angry phone calls and show up in droves to town halls that leaders have urged lawmakers to avoid. Some members have resented that lack of communication.\n\nBut the key is that the budget is being changed without anyone actually knowing what’s happening. Even members of Congress. It’s important to note that literally nothing DOGE is doing is public. Everything we think we know is from press reporting based on leaks. So no one knows what’s happening and no one who is accountable to anyone at an election is actually doing it. Some Republican senators are coming in now, as the article explains, and saying ‘hey we get the final word here. Nothing is official until we vote.’ But that’s BS. USAID and CFPB and huge swaths of the federal government have already been shut down. So for calendar 2025 the decision has already been made. And to a great extent DOGE is creating faits accompli into the future. Once you fire everyone and cancel all the contracts you can’t just flip a switch and it comes back into existence. That’s all by design.\n\nEssentially, the Republican legislators are asking Musk to bail them out so they don’t have to vote in public on his foolishness. The fundamental cowardice of Republican officeholders is really something to see.\n\nOver at the DOD, Secretary Pete Hegseth has been beavering away at wringing the DEI out of Defense Department materials. This is being done with the careful processes that are a hallmark of this administration. From the AP:\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given the military until Wednesday to remove content that highlights diversity efforts in its ranks following President Donald Trump’s executive order ending those programs across the federal government. The vast majority of the Pentagon purge targets women and minorities, including notable milestones made in the military. And it also removes a large number of posts that mention various commemorative months—such as those for Black and Hispanic people and women. In some cases, photos seemed to be flagged for removal simply because their file included the word “gay,” including service members with that last name and an image of the B-29 aircraft Enola Gay, which dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II.\n\nSeveral photos of an Army Corps of Engineers dredging project in California were marked for deletion, apparently because a local engineer in the photo had the last name Gay. And a photo of Army Corps biologists was on the list, seemingly because it mentioned they were recording data about fish—including their weight, size, hatchery and gender.\n\nClowns to the left of me, clowns to the right of me, volleyed and thundered...\n\nWeekly WWOZ Pick to Click: “Ghost of the Blues” (Sidney Bechet): Yeah, I still pretty much love New Orleans.\n\nWeekly Visit to the Pathé Archives: It being Women’s History Month and all, here, from 1916, is the first woman zookeeper in the UK. Granted, her duties were limited to working with chickens in an exhibit demonstrating how keeping your own poultry was a good hedge against wartime shortages, but small steps, right? And don’t get too arrogant about the whole thing. This week, in 20freaking25, the Secretary of Agriculture recommended that we keep our own chickens if egg prices continue to rise. History is so cool, especially when it repeats itself.\n\nThe very worst story to come out of the Grand Sellout is probably this one served up by Politico Europe. It seems that the administration has been in touch with Ukrainian opposition politicians in an effort to submarine the Zelenskyy government. If you interpret this news as the administration’s possible willingness to countenance a coup that would install a government that would agree to the kind of draconian deal favored by both the Trump and Putin governments, well, shame on you, anyway.\n\nThe official line from the U.S. administration is that Trump is not interfering in Ukraine’s domestic politics. This week, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick denied his boss was “weighing into Ukrainian politics,” adding all that Trump wants is a partner for peace. But the behavior of Trump and his officials suggests quite the opposite. Trump has accused Zelenskyy of being a “dictator without elections,” and hinted he would not be “around very long” if he didn’t do a deal with Russia. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has falsely accused Kyiv of canceling the election. (In response to the news in this article, Elon Musk tweeted: “Ukraine needs to hold an election. Zelensky would lose by a landslide.”)\n\nPolls suggest otherwise, of course. Musk doesn’t know fck-all about Ukrainian politics. But history tells us that, when the U.S. arranges a coup, they usually work. Zelenskyy needs to watch his back.\n\nDiscovery Corner: Hey, look at what we found! From Smithsonian:\n\nBeginning some 3,000 years ago, Southeast Asian peoples began voyaging out into the Pacific and settling the islands of Polynesia. These ancient sailors navigated by the stars, traversing the ocean in large canoes carved from trees. Now, one of those boats, known as a waka, has been found in hundreds of pieces in New Zealand’s Chatham Islands. Experts say the artifact could be one of the most significant discoveries of its kind. “No matter how old it is, we can’t overstate how incredible it is,” Justin Maxwell, the archaeologist leading the investigation, tells the Guardian’s Veronika Meduna. “It will go down as one of the most important finds of all time in Polynesia.”\n\nAs regular visitors to the shebeen know, we have a preference for accidental finds that change history, and this one is a doozy.\n\n“My son and I were just loading the boat up and taking the dogs for a run up the beach … just after a big rain,” Vincent, a local fisherman, tells Radio New Zealand. Then, Nikau saw pieces of timber in the river. The wood sported strange holes, and it appeared to be well preserved. “We were like, ‘Sweet, some new timber for us to use,’ ” Nikau tells Myjanne Jensen and Hikurangi Jackson of the TV series “Te Ao with Moana.” “We took it all home [and] started putting it together, just trying to find out what it was about. … And we were like, ‘Hey, this is starting to form the shape of a boat.’ ”\n\nA fisherman. His son. Their dog, and a find that thrills the experts. Get me the Netflix people, stat!\n\nHey, Popular Science, is it a good day for dinosaur news? It’s always a good day for dinosaur news!\n\nFrom its well-preserved bones, the paleontologists believe that Chadititan was a small and slender dinosaur, with elongated vertebrae and delicate limbs that set it apart from other titanosaurs. It was an herbivore and belonged to the Rinconsaurian group.\n\nAt 22 feet, this new find is one of the less titanic of the titanosauria, but it was found in the middle of a treasure trove of other fossils, including hundreds of turtles.\n\nThe bones were uncovered near a salt flat in the Anacleto Formation in northern Patagonia, Argentina, and found among fossils of ancient snails, garfishes, crocodile relatives, clams, freshwater turtles, and other organisms. Among this prehistoric treasure trove, the team uncovered the first fossil record of a family of tropical land snails—Neocyclotidae—and the first example of a small, tropical air-breathing land snail in the genus Leptinaria. This area was once a small pond surrounded by sand dunes and palm trees in what was a more arid and dry environment.\n\nNice to know it had company. And “air-breathing land snail” is odds-on to be useful in our coverage of the current administration. Just another way that they lived then to make us happy now.\n\nI’ll be back on Monday, for whatever fresh hell awaits... Be well and play nice, ya bastids. Stay above the snake-line and wear the damn masks, and take the damn shots, especially the boosters and the New One. In your spare time, spare a thought for everyone touched by the floods in Kentucky and in West Virginia, and by the crash in Washington, and by the measles outbreak in the Southwest, and in the fire zones in Los Angeles, and for all the folks in Ukraine, who stubbornly fight on, and all the folks in Gaza, and all the people in New Orleans, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Queens, who were visited by the Crazy before the year had hardly begun. And the folks in L.A., now fighting floods and mudslides exacerbated by the recent wildfires. And the folks in Lahaina, who are still rebuilding. And all the folks we regularly cited here in the year gone by, and especially for our fellow citizens in the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve so much better from their country than they’ve been getting. And for all of us, who will be getting exactly what we deserve.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "(Permanent Musical Accompaniment to this Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what’s goin’ down in the several states where, as we know, the real work of governmentin’ gets done and where the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount.\n\nWe begin in Wyoming, which our friends at the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists have been studying because it has become the Rocky Mountain equivalent of an offshore corporate haven, where hundreds of phantom corporations are based. And in the latest installment of the Wyoming saga, the ICIJ reports that millions of dollars from the Paycheck Protection Act may have disappeared in that maze of corporate sleight of hand during the course of the pandemic.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, in an attempt to avert an economic collapse amid COVID-19 shutdowns, the U.S. government began dispensing billions of dollars in emergency loans to American businesses to maintain their payrolls. Among the millions that received the Paycheck Protection Program funds was a Wyoming-registered firm called the Alo Group*, which received $531,562 to support the wages of 36 U.S.-based employees the firm said it had, according to public records.\n\nBut it’s unclear whether the Alo Group was a legitimate business. The firm has no public profile, and on a state corporate filing it listed a disposable email address—vayapef199@homapin.com—at a domain name that has been used by scammers, according to the fraud detection firm IPQS. After it received the large COVID relief payment, the Alo Group switched its listed mailing address to a building in China, according to corporate records, before dissolving completely for failing to file required state paperwork.\n\nThe Alo Group traces its origin to a single-story storefront in Sheridan that is a hotspot in the state’s thriving corporate formation industry. The small building is home to the Sheridan office of Registered Agents Inc., a national corporate services firm; more than 266,000 companies incorporated using the address of this modest office between 2019 and 2024, according to an International Consortium of Investigative Journalists analysis of information provided by the data firm OpenCorporates.\n\n[Editor’s note: *No relation to Alo Yoga]\n\nAccording to the ICIJ, this storefront in Sheridan, Wyoming, was, on paper anyway, busier than 55 Water Street in New York City.\n\nCompanies registered at the Sheridan storefront are listed in a half-dozen criminal indictments of people across the country who allegedly stole millions in COVID relief payments from the federal government, according to an ICIJ analysis. Hundreds more companies that together received tens of millions of dollars in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans share the same Sheridan address: 30 N. Gould St. Some of these appear to be legitimate firms, but dozens, like the Alo Group, have little trace of aboveboard business.\n\nAnd Wyoming is in the middle of an economic boom of corporate malfeasance.\n\nThe fraud indictments add to growing evidence that Wyoming is a major new destination for people outside the state—including criminals, suspected North Korean sanctions evaders, and those with wealth of dubious origin—to incorporate secretive limited liability companies, or LLCs, and other entities to hold and move cash. In December, ICIJ reporting showed that the state had overtaken Delaware in its rising per capita number of incorporations, leaving officials in the least populated U.S. state grappling with how to oversee a proliferation of anonymous shell companies.\n\nDelaware dethroned!\n\nTara Berg, the county assessor for Wyoming’s Fremont County, told ICIJ that over the past several years residents have begun complaining about shell companies that, in an apparent attempt to appear legitimate, have falsely used the residents’ home addresses on corporate filings. “We have people bringing us stacks of mail that they’re getting for these companies at their addresses,” Berg said. “People are panicked.”\n\nA single storefront at 30 N. Gould Street in Sheridan is the alleged home of 40 percent of the new incorporations registered in Wyoming in the past five years. And some of them are real prizes.\n\nSuch cases include that of Andrew Marnell, who pleaded guilty to bank fraud and money laundering and was sentenced in 2023 in a Los Angeles federal court for using shell companies to obtain nearly $9 million in PPP loans for hundreds of fictitious employees. Marnell spent the proceeds on, among other items, Rolex watches, a Range Rover, and a Ducati motorcycle, according to federal prosecutors. One of the key firms in his scheme, Slatestone LLC, was registered at 30 N. Gould St. and received more than $1.3 million to support 75 people the firm claimed to employ, according to prosecutors.\n\nAccording to a 2024 indictment and corporate records, a Florida-based man named Jared Dean Eakes established an array of shell companies—all registered at 30 N. Gould St.—that took in $4.8 million in fraudulent loans from the federal government. Eakes, a former Merrill Lynch financial adviser and broker, also allegedly used companies registered at the address to steal more than $2 million from people who transferred him funds believing he was a private wealth manager, according to the indictment. Eakes pleaded not guilty to the charges and the case is pending.\n\nIn August 2024, Andre Shammas, in San Diego, pleaded guilty to helping to set up shell companies, including one registered at 30 N. Gould St., to defraud the government’s emergency relief program and obtain more than 40 PPP loans with a total value exceeding $5 million.\n\nSheridan, Wyoming—the Caymans of the northern Rockies. Aren’t business-friendly environments great?\n\nWe move along to North Carolina, where the state’s Republicans simply cannot stop themselves from playing monkey-mischief with the state’s reapportionment processes. From the NC Newsline:\n\nExperts say it would run afoul of the U.S. Constitution and long-established U.S. Supreme Court precedent, but that hasn’t deterred a group of Republican members of the state House from reintroducing an amendment to the state constitution that would dramatically alter how North Carolinians elect state senators. Under the proposal, each of the state’s 50 senators would represent two of the state’s 100 counties, rather than a roughly equal number of state residents, as is the case now. Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba), who is one of the measure’s chief sponsors, filed House Bill 234, which is entitled “Little Federal Model NC Edition,” on Feb. 26. Adams introduced the same proposal in 2023, but it died in committee.\n\nRep. Adams is nothing if not persistent, and he has a specific goal in mind.\n\nThe proposal would almost certainly have the effect of further expanding Republican dominance in the Senate—where it currently enjoys a 30–20 advantage—by allotting many more senators to conservative, rural areas. Wake and Mecklenburg counties, the homes of Raleigh and Charlotte, respectively, are the state’s most populous. They each have six senators representing portions of the counties in the 2025–2026 legislative session, according to the General Assembly’s website. Of these 12 lawmakers, only one is Republican: Rep. Vickie Sawyer, whose district covers part of Mecklenburg County and all of Iredell County.\n\nIf the proposed amendment were to become law, one senator would represent Wake and a neighboring county—the text declares districts must consist of “contiguous territory.” This means that instead of six Democratic lawmakers representing portions of Wake County, there would be only one, whose constituency would be comprised of North Carolina’s most populous county and an additional adjoining county.\n\nI don’t think the Republicans in North Carolina have any intention of letting an election be decided on the square ever again. Issues? What are those?\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, whence Blog Official Portuguese Man of War Friedman of the Algarve brings us one small step short of faith healing. From Oklahoma Voice:\n\nHouse Bill 1224, authored by Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, moved through the Health and Human Services Oversight Committee Monday with a 7–6 vote with bipartisan opposition. Around 30 health care providers from around the state gathered at the Capitol and filled the committee meeting to advocate against the bill. They said they were disappointed by the outcome of the vote. The legislation, which West said has been successful in a handful of states, could allow a physician, or an entire hospital, to choose not to offer procedures that conflict with personal beliefs. This excludes emergency care, although the bill does not define the parameters that create that situation. No specific procedures or types of care are outlined in the bill, meaning a health care provider, institution or payor could choose to stop offering STD testing, blood transfusions or elective procedures.\n\nNaturally, because you want as much ambiguity as possible while you’re bleeding out on the floor of the ER.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it.",

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "From Politico:\n\nTo fulfill conservative demands to cut non-defense funding, Republican leaders are seeking to zero out funding for a slew of programs—much of which had previous been subject to earmarks personally requested by lawmakers. The bill, for instance, does not renew $40 million in fiscal 2024 funding for more than 70 programs that help children and families. Most had been requested by Democratic senators, but not all: Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith previously secured $250,000 for a group that works to prevent child abuse in her home state of Mississippi and GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski requested more than $5 million to help fund homeless shelters and prevent child abuse in Alaska.\n\nAlso forgone are $890 million in grants for health care facilities and equipment. Again, the fiscal 2024 funding had been distributed on a bipartisan basis: GOP Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Roger Wicker of Mississippi were among those who requested funding for clinics and hospitals in their states. Bipartisan emergency preparedness and disaster mitigation projects funded through $293 million of earmarked FEMA dollars are also not renewed, as well as $116 million in Small Business Administration funding and $107 million in workforce development projects. Clean water projects, law enforcement grants and tribal assistance are also targeted in the bill.\n\nThis is the “stopgap” bill that Speaker Moses plans to pass in the House on Tuesday, whereupon he reportedly intends to adjourn the House, dumping this extraordinary lump of toxic cruelty in the Senate’s lap. With a Friday deadline for a government shutdown, this allegedly would put pressure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. If enough Democrats don’t cross party lines to vote for the bill and the government does shut down, they could get blamed for it. But Speaker Moses needs eight Senate Democrats for this strategy to work—Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul already has come out against the bill. (Senator Aqua Buddha has his reasons, but I think paramount among them is his unquenchable desire to be a pain in the ass.)\n\nI don’t think Schumer can lose eight members of his caucus over this bill, but given the mixed signals from all parts of the Democratic Party these days, I’m not sure anything can be taken for granted. What I do know is that this bill should have been smothered in its cradle by any legislator with a soul. Targeting clean-water projects? Man, fck these people.",

Now, I find all of the president’s attempts at charm to be offensive, but I don’t think that was NYT’s point anyway. But let us take a look at how the charm offensive was going this weekend.\n\nOur own Logan Airport apparently has been turned into an immigration black site, complete with enhanced interrogation. Dozens of stories have emerged of the human costs on the ongoing DOGE and Pony Show—graduate schools rescinding acceptances because federal funding for programs has been cut, Social Security recipients being denied benefits because somebody somewhere declared them dead, pediatric brain-cancer patients being abandoned mid-treatment, court orders now being routinely ignored to the point where tin-pot Central American presidents are mocking them. The president is now threatening to ignore the lawful pardons granted by former president Biden, basing this latest power grab on a theory even more laughable than the one he used to justify his reverse human trafficking to El Salvador. Arlington National Cemetery and the U.S. Army scrubs its website records of Black and Hispanic and other minority military members, including the 442nd Infantry, the famous Nisei unit in World War II that was recruited from Japanese Americans out of the detention camps where they were being held. He’s demanding that Columbia University knuckle under even more than it already has and has said quite plainly that Columbia is merely the lab rat for a genuine assault on the country’s colleges and universities.

        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "One of the thousand lawsuits a’blooming as we come into spring is this massive one filed against practically every official of the administration, but especially against Elon Musk and the leaders of the DOGE and Pony Show. The plaintiffs are an impressively varied array of organizations: the Japanese American Citizens League, the OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, the Sierra Club, and the Union of Concerned Scientists...\n\nThe actual casus belli is the promiscuous bloodbath that the DOGE and Pony Show has unleashed among the administrative agencies—the firing of the forest rangers; the elimination of National Park personnel at, among other sites, the national monuments dedicated to the memory of Japanese Americans held in concentration camps during World War II; and, of course, the complete incompetence demonstrated in connection with nuclear safety. But the real meat of things can be found in this outburst of old-fashioned plain talk that introduces the plaintiffs’ filing.\n\nDefendant Elon Musk is not, legally, the President of the United States, nor is he a federal elected official of any kind. And Mr. Musk is not a Senate-confirmed officer of the United States. But he and his so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE)—not, in fact, a federal executive department—are lawlessly and unconstitutionally wielding sweeping power across the executive branch. As Mr. Musk and DOGE lawlessly seize power over large swaths of federal spending, decimate the federal workforce, and dismantle federal agencies, they are severely harming, and threatening further imminent harm, to everyday Americans. 2. Mr. Musk and DOGE are running roughshod over the constitutional separation of powers.\n\nFurther, Mr. Musk is exercising the authority of a principal officer of the United States without Senate confirmation—and, indeed, exercising authority even in excess of a principal officer. These actions are ultra vires, violate the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers, and, as to Mr. Musk, also violate the Constitution’s Appointments Clause. Mr. Musk and DOGE’s lawless actions threaten the bedrock of our democracy, and they are already causing severe harms in a wide array of areas of daily life.\n\nSee how easy that is?",

        "content": "I paid no attention to the appearance before Congress of a vulgar-talking yam, because I have tired completely of the threadbare lies and the inevitably unhinged rant. Here’s one example of the kind of line I cannot stomach:\n\nI believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that.\n\nYeah, no time for that blasphemous swill. Not from the most thoroughgoing heathen ever to hold high public office in this country. No time, either, for triumphal pronouncements about freeing us all from “unelected bureaucrats” shortly after praising Elon Musk’s idiotic clear-cutting of the executive agencies. Not only did I not vote for Elon Musk, but he doesn’t believe anyone should get to vote for anyone ever. Don’t waste my time with this bullshit. I feel the need for a decontamination shower just reading the transcript.\n\nI was more interested in the official Democratic response from Senator Elissa Slotkin just to see how appalled the Democratic legislative elite would answer the genuine threat that hides behind the lies and the delusions of competence.\n\nThe answer ... eh?\n\nYou can find that same sense of patriotism here in Wyandotte, Michigan, where I am tonight. It’s a working-class town just south of Detroit. President Trump and I both won here in November. It might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist all across the United States—places where people believe that if you work hard, and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids do better. It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat. But it was never a big deal. Because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party.\n\nOh, my dear God in heaven, it is not 1992 any more. The American republic is in genuine peril. Democracy is hanging over the abyss on a very thin thread. And if that thread gives out, a lot of people everywhere, including Wyandotte, are going to feel the impact very deeply.\n\nPresident Trump loves to promise “peace through strength.” That’s actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling over in his grave. We all want an end to the war in Ukraine, but Reagan understood that true strength required America to combine our military and economic might with moral clarity. And that scene in the Oval Office wasn’t just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump’s whole approach to the world. He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends, like Canada, in the teeth. He sees American leadership as merely a series of real estate transactions. As a Cold War kid, I’m thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s. Trump would have lost us the Cold War.\n\nJust shoot me now. I never have been thankful for Ronald Reagan in any goddamn context whatsoever. In fact, just yesterday, one of the guys who really won the Cold War, Lech Wałęsa, formerly of the Gdansk Shipyard, and several of his fellow freedom fighters wrote to El Caudillo del Mar-a-Lago reprimanding him for his betrayal of Ukraine and for being subservient to Vladimir Putin.\n\nWe were also terrified by the fact that the atmosphere in the Oval Office during this conversation reminded us of the one we remember well from interrogations by the Security Service and from the courtrooms in communist courts.\n\nBut Elissa Slotkin summons up Ronald Reagan. It’s not 1982 anymore, either.\n\nThere followed banal encomiums to American greatness and to citizen involvement, as well as the standard rhetorical wha-dee-doo-dah that has been rendered obsolete in the face of the bonfire into which this administration is feeding everything that truly is great about the country. I’m sure Elissa Slotkin is completely sincere, and I do hope she gets reelected to the Senate every time she runs again. But as for responses to what the president said on Tuesday night, give me Rep. Al Green, the Democrat Congressman from Texas who stood and shook his cane at Trump until House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered the sergeant at arms to remove him. After all, I believe that every citizen deserves to give exactly the same amount of respect to this president as he gives to the office he holds and to the oath he took just over a month ago. Which is to say, not a damn bit.",

        "title": "The Alien Enemies Act Has Been an Offense Against the Constitution Since Birth",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "The good folks at the Brennan Center for Justice have delivered a helpful primer on the Alien Enemies Act, that dusty, tattered old fig leaf being used by the administration to cover itself for its new mass deportation project. You will be shocked, I’m sure, to learn that the administration is misusing this Revolution-era relic to serve the president’s own mad purposes.\n\nAs the Supreme Court and past presidents have acknowledged, the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority enacted and implemented under the war power. When the Fifth Congress passed the law and the Wilson administration defended it in court during World War I, they did so on the understanding that noncitizens with connections to a foreign belligerent could be “treated as prisoners of war” under the “rules of war under the law of nations.” In the Constitution and other late-1700s statutes, the term invasion is used literally, typically to refer to large-scale attacks. The term predatory incursion is also used literally in writings of that period to refer to slightly smaller attacks like the 1781 Raid on Richmond led by American defector Benedict Arnold.\n\nToday, some anti-immigration politicians and groups urge a non-literal reading of invasion and predatory incursion so that the Alien Enemies Act can be invoked in response to unlawful migration and cross-border narcotics trafficking. These politicians and groups view the Alien Enemies Act as a turbocharged deportation authority. But their proposed reading of the law is at odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice, all of which confirm that the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority. Invoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse.\n\nThe problem is that there is enough leaky precedent regarding the use of this law for the administration to use for its own purposes. (For example, President Truman used it to extend wartime detentions and deportations until 1951.) Moreover, as the Brennan report makes clear, there is a yawning loophole through which the courts can dive if they choose to do so.\n\nThe courts should strike down any attempted peacetime use of the Alien Enemies Act, but the political question doctrine may prevent them from doing so. This doctrine cautions the courts against addressing issues that fall within Congress and the president’s constitutional duties and that lack judicially manageable standards for resolution. The courts have used the political question doctrine to avoid resolving claims that touch on matters of war and peace, as well as other sensitive foreign policy matters.\n\nNevertheless, this was a law that was an offense against the Constitution almost from birth. It was part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, President John Adams’s lasting gift to future American autocrats that Thomas Jefferson deemed to be part of the “reign of witches.” In fact, the Alien Enemies Act is the only one of those noxious statutes still on the books, as the Brennan Center said in an earlier report, because it was the only one of those acts without a “sunset” clause. Attempts to repeal it have failed, repeatedly. So like the Espionage Act and other laws enacted to respond to temporary (or imaginary) threats, it sits in our laws like a sleeping virus awaiting another outbreak, like this one.",

        "content": "So we’re disappearing people now? Nice to know.\n\nFrom Zeteo:\n\nAccording to the advocates, at around 8:30 PM, Khalil and his wife—who is eight months pregnant—had just unlocked the door to their building when two plainclothes DHS agents pushed inside behind them. The agents allegedly did not identify themselves at first, instead asking for Khalil’s identity before detaining him.\n\nThe agents proceeded to tell Khalil’s wife that if she did not leave her husband and go to their apartment, they would arrest her too. The agents claimed that the State Department had revoked Khalil’s student visa, with one agent presenting what he claimed was a warrant on his cell phone. But Khalil, according to advocates, has a green card. Khalil’s wife went to their apartment to get the green card. “He has a green card,” an agent apparently said on the phone, confused by the matter. But then after a moment, the agent claimed that the State Department had “revoked that too.” Meanwhile, Khalil had been on the phone with his attorney, Amy Greer, who was trying to intervene, asking why he was being detained, if they had a warrant, and explaining that Khalil was a green card holder. The attorney had circled back to demanding to see a warrant when the agents apparently instead hung up the phone. Khalil is currently being held in an ICE detention center in Louisiana, per the ICE detention tracker.\n\nThat’s a comfort to his wife, I’m sure, and to those of us who remember being angry at the Bush Administration’s rendition policies. Are we now allowing the rendition of legal residents to black sites in the United States? Where would he be in Louisiana? Angola? That would be fun. There are six federal prison facilities in that state. One of those facilities in Oakdale was the subject of a Department of Justice report in 2020 for refusing to follow the Covid protocols mandated by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons during the pandemic. Eight prisoners died there.\n\nIn any event, what the hell is this? Disappearing a legal resident because he led a protest against the actions of another country? . From The New York Times:\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement on Sunday night that Mr. Khalil had been arrested “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting antisemitism.” “Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,” she said. “ICE and the Department of State are committed to enforcing President Trump’s executive orders and to protecting U.S. national security.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio shared a link on X to a news article about Mr. Khalil’s arrest and issued a broad promise: “We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.”\n\n“Aligned to”? That’s what they have? Until there’s a complete airing of the reasons for Khalil’s detention, I have no problem believing this to be an attack on protected political speech—and a dress rehearsal for what this administration has planned if widespread protests of its other policies break out. (And that may be closer than you think. There were large demonstrations in Chicago this weekend, and the president and his lacke ... er ... officials already have made ominous noises about revenging themselves against people and institutions that harsh their mellows. Maybe Vice President J. Divan Vance can lecture his boss about free speech the way he lectured Europe a few weeks back.",

The move, expected as soon as April, would be a stunning reversal of the welcome Ukrainians received under President Joe Biden’s administration. The planned rollback of protections for Ukrainians was underway before Trump publicly feuded with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week. It is part of a broader Trump administration effort to strip legal status from more than 1.8 million migrants allowed to enter the U.S. under temporary humanitarian parole programs launched under the Biden administration, the sources said.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the White House denied the report, calling it “fake news.” Later in the day, Trump acknowledged he’s weighing the decision. “There were some people that think that’s appropriate, and some people don’t, and I’ll be making the decision pretty soon,” he said.\n\n\n\nIt is possible that this move is just part of the draconian anti-immigrant policies that a group of mayors—including Boston’s Michelle Wu—tore up before a congressional committee on Wednesday. As the Reuters story points out, the rollback was ongoing before the Oval Office ambush of Zelenskyy last week. But it should be seen in the context of other events, not merely the ambush but also Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s ordering the cessation of U.S. cyber operations against Russia. (The Pentagon has subsequently denied that this ever happened. YMMV.) It should be colored by the accurate perception that the administration is doing the Kremlin’s business by selling out Ukraine for a “peace” deal by which Ukraine gains nothing, and by edging toward an abandonment of NATO that is so obvious that French president Emmanuel Macron took to the electric TV machine to warn that the lamps are beginning to dim all over Europe again. The president has allied the country with a failing kleptocracy run by an international thug who is even money one day to flee to a Pacific island with all of his country’s wealth he can grab on the way out of town.\n\nUkrainian refugees were an international feel-good story in the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion. (Among other places, Ireland welcomed them with open arms.) Now—in this country, anyway—they’re just another bargaining chip in a rigged game between a couple of incompetent autocrats. It is to weep.",

        "title": "Trump’s Call to Annex Canada as a State Should Have Invoked the 25th Amendment",
        "source": "https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/",
        "content": "What has become plain this week is that the entire administration has committed itself to the president’s pipe dream of annexing Canada as the 51st state. It wasn’t just the president’s bizarre appearance with Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, in which the president took a short stroll around the Izonkosphere.\n\n“Canada only works as a state. … This would be the most incredible country visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S., just a straight artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many, many decades ago, and makes no sense.”\n\nIt is necessary at this point to mention that the so-called “artificial line” is usually referred to as a “border.” The president seems to grasp the concept when referring to the “artificial line” separating the United States and Mexico. Strange, that. The president went on.\n\n“It’s so perfect as a great and cherished state. I love [O, Canada]. I think it’s great. Keep it, but it will be for the state, one of our greatest states, maybe our greatest state.”\n\nWonderful. He’s going to let them keep their national anthem, one of the world’s most stirring, but only as a state song, like “On the Banks of the Wabash,” “Georgia on My Mind,” or “On, Wisconsin.” I suppose he’ll let them keep their hockey teams, too.\n\nThe whole episode should have brought about an instantaneous Cabinet meeting at which the 25th Amendment was invoked. The president was clearly irrational. Instead, there was Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick seconding the motion. From the Hill:\n\n“The best way, the president has said it, the best way to actually merge the economies of Canada and the United States is for Canada to become our 51st state. If they want to merge it, that’s how you make it the 51st state,” Lutnick said on Fox Business Network’s Varney & Co.\n\nIt really is a cult, you know.\n\nOn the Bluesky app, journalist and author Garrett Epps shrewdly pointed out that in Fletcher Knebel’s Night of Camp David, one of the first manifestations of President Mark Hollenbach’s mental illness was his secret desire to merge the United States and Canada—as well as all of Scandanavia—into a single entity called “Aspen.” In fact, the book was reissued during the first Trump administration, and it was referenced on TV by both Rachel Maddow and Bob Woodward. Now, though, with the president’s grand design seeming to parallel the grandiose foreign-policy proposal of the fictional President Hollenbach, the book has taken on an even greater salience.\n\n(By the way, the hero of the book is a young, ambitious first-term senator named James McVeagh with whom the crazy president shares his notions in the aforementioned night at Camp David. Maybe you can see J. Divan Vance in that role, but I can’t.)\n\nIn the novel, the crazy president sounds almost rational in explaining the irrational.\n\n“Canada is the wealthiest nation on earth.” Hollenbach’s words raced after each other. …“The mineral riches under her soil are incredible in their immensity. Even with modern demands, they are well-nigh inexhaustible. Believe me, Jim, Canada will be the seat of power in the next century and, properly exploited and conserved, her riches can go for a thousand years. ...\n\n.. But the merger of know-how, power, and character, the United States, Canada, and Scandinavia, the new nation under one parliament and one president could keep the peace for centuries. The president of the union should be the man who dreamed the dreams of giants. ...\n\n… “I only exclude Europe at the start,” said Hollenbach, and his face quickly lighted again. “Right now, Europe has nothing to give us. But once we have built the fortress of Aspen, I predict the nations of Europe will pound at the door to get in. And, if they don’t, we’ll have the power to force them into the new nation. … There are other kinds of pressure, trade duties and barriers, financial measures, economic sanctions, if you will. But, never fear, Jim. England, France, Germany, and the Low Countries, too, can be brought to heel.\n\nWhen Knebel wrote his classic Seven Days in May, about an attempted military junta in Washington, he was drawing on inside knowledge about the turmoil in the Kennedy administration between the president, the Joint Chiefs, and the intelligence community—turmoil that would do a lot to feed suspicions after the president’s murder in 1963. JFK was a big fan of the book, so much that he allowed director John Frankenheimer to photograph the White House so he could make the sets for his film adaptation.\n\nIn the case of Night of Camp David, Knebel was able to draw on American attempts to absorb Canada that dated back to the founding of the nation. In fact, Article XI of the original Articles of Confederation read as follows:\n\nCanada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this Union.\n\nThe American Revolution helped the new country break off those parts of British North America in and around the Great Lakes. We tried to seize the entire country in the War of 1812, but we failed, and we got Washington burned in the bargain. Through the years up to the American Civil War, there were annexation groups on both sides of the border.\n\nIn 1860, Secretary of State William Seward came close to annexing the territory from Washington state all the way up to Alaska, which at the time was owned by Russia. For a while, it looked like Great Britain might actually swing for the deal. But,when Seward bought Alaska in 1868, the people in the region began to feel uncomfortable with the U.S. closing in from both the north and south, so popular opinion shifted. Then, of course, there were the Fenians.\n\nThe Fenian Brotherhood was a product of one of the periodic risings in Ireland against British rule. It was the American wing of what was called in Ireland the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The American Fenians were a substantial force. They had money—upwards of $500,000—and weapons and an army made up of veterans of the American Civil War. (They were led by John O’Mahony, who’d fought with the 69th New York, part of the famed Irish Brigade.) After the war, the Fenians launched a series of raids into Canada. They came in two bursts—one in 1866 and another in 1870–71. They occurred all over Canada, from Manitoba to the Maritimes. None of them succeeded, and one of them, a raid around the Minnesota–Manitoba border, never even made it into Canada. The only real result was to strengthen Canadian nationalism; the raids were pivotal in the eventual development of the Canadian confederation in 1867, an arrangement that the current U.S. president believes would make a helluva 51st state. In the debate over forming the confederation, Sir John MacDonald said:\n\nIf we do not take advantage of the time, if we show ourselves unequal to the occasion, it may never return, and we shall hereafter bitterly and unavailingly regret having failed to embrace the happy opportunity now offered of founding a great nation under the fostering care of Great Britain, and our Sovereign Lady, Queen Victoria.\n\nOne of MacDonald’s primary concerns while forming the confederation was American meddling, especially in the rebellious western parts of Canada. He wrote to his minister of finance:\n\nI cannot understand the desire of the Colonial Office, or of the Company, to saddle the responsibility of the government on Canada just now. It would so completely throw the game into the hands of the insurgents and the Yankee wirepullers, who are to some extent influencing and directing the movement from St. Paul that we cannot foresee the consequences.\n\nYou always have to watch out for those Yankee wirepullers. Can’t trust them worth a damn.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the “Last Call with Charles P. Pierce” newsletter. Subscribe here.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Here’s a new celebrity spotting to mull over: Earlier this week, Tom Cruise and Ana de Armas were spotted touching down at the London Heliport together. This marked the second sighting of the actors that week, at the very same heliport. Back in February, they were also reportedly seen engaging in a night out in London (the day before Valentine’s Day, no less).\n\nAs of now, representatives for both Cruise and Armas have yet to confirm whether or not they are dating—so any news of them being a couple is purely speculative. Perhaps these are all secretive work meetings? (They were, after all, seen at Longcross Studios last week—a film and television studio.) But if there is one thing we can confirm, it‘s that their latest sighting did include complementary travel style.\n\nHopping off their private helicopter, both stars opted for a comfy but polished look that is built for being on-the-go. The Top Gun: Maverick star wore classic black jeans and a brown button-down shirt, while Armas sported a chic black trench coat, paired with a white tee, jeans, and white sneakers. Whether they coordinated their minimal looks—both in neutral colors—is up for debate. But if confirmed A-list couples have shown us anything while out and about, it’s that they do often dress alike. Do with that information what you will—and perhaps consider a minimalist, neutral look the next time you travel.",

        "content": "With femininity and its trappings the central subject of the fall shows, this lookbook drop from Phoebe Philo couldn’t be better timed. Philo has always been piquant on this subject, whether that meant putting women in Birkenstock-ish sandals when flats on the runway were almost unheard of, or scaling down her fashion show when she was expecting a child, prioritizing health and happiness over what we’d call Earned Media Value today, even though the Celine phenomenon she had spearheaded was near its peak.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Phoebe Philo Photo: Courtesy of Phoebe Philo\n\nSo what does Philo have to say about how women should get dressed in 2025? Nothing as mundane as an hourglass curve or a power shoulder. Consider, instead, her one-piece jacket and apron skirt combo, which turns to very nearly reveal a flash of backside. So confident and so cheeky. For the customer who prefers to style the look with trousers, the back-zip pants are worth a close look. An elaboration on a pair she showed in her first PP collection, which bared the skin behind the zips, these unzip to fabric, allowing the wearer to adjust the volume of the legs without exposing anything—cool irreverence with a welcome dash of practicality.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Phoebe Philo Photo: Courtesy of Phoebe Philo Photo: Courtesy of Phoebe Philo\n\nOther novelties here include a high necked sweater with a sculptural drape and strap trousers that fully unzip at the knees. For Philo fans, skirts with a neo-Renaissance hip construction made with jersey bonded to neoprene echoed a silhouette she first proposed at her last show for Celine, only here more pronounced. She used a similar bonding technique to give sculptural form to a knit top. Meanwhile, if there’s a shoe that can make women kick their flats habit, it just may be this season’s new mule, which takes its construction cues from a cowboy boot, with a row of silvery nail heads punctuating the sharply angular toe front.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Fashion’s game of musical chairs continues: This morning, it was announced that Jonathan Anderson is departing his post as the creative director of Loewe. Anderson first joined the Spanish luxury brand in 2013, showing his first collection during the spring 2015 season. For over a decade now, Anderson has infused the house with a distinctive point-of-view—and his approach to celebrity red carpet dressing has been equally as identifiable. In honor of the news, Vogue is looking back at some of his very best moments over the years.\n\nCreating custom looks for A-listers such as Zendaya, Greta Lee, and Ayo Edebiri, Anderson has encouraged stars to embrace quirkiness and irreverence—both of which have infused the step and repeats with a sense of off-kilter fun. It is, perhaps, what we will miss most about his tenure at Loewe. Where other stars have adhered to the glitzy gowns and classic suits that you expect to see in Hollywood, Anderson has marched to the beat of his own drum instead, serving up everything from voluminous three-dimensional gowns (see: Greta Lee at the 2024 Met Gala), to whimsical suiting punctuated with turnip embroidery (see: Mike Fast at the Met that same year).\n\nBrian Craig/Getty Images\n\nWhat else made the cut for Anderson’s Loewe red carpet highlights? There was Zendaya’s whole Challengers press tour, for which he outfitted the star in perfect method-dressing looks such as tennis-themed evening gowns (and tennis ball heels, too!). At the designer’s fashion week shows, he has also treated VIP guests as his muses—dressing Chloe Sevigny in fur coats and silk bows, and Maude Apatow in his balloon-embellished dresses. These are not your regular LBDs, after all: You could always count on Anderson to infuse looks with a sense of humor.\n\nOne can’t forget his many winning moments dressing performers for the stage, too. He created one of the most viral tour looks in recent times: When Beyoncé performed her Renaissance tour in 2023 wearing his bejeweled catsuit with surreal printed arms all over it. That same year, Anderson also dressed Rihanna for the Super Bowl—and fans will never forget when she announced her second pregnancy in his red flight suit and molded breasplate.\n\nBelow, more of Anderson’s best red carpet moments at Loewe.",

First, there was a not-quite announcement, through a source quoted in The Times, that the Palace would no longer be issuing details on the Princess of Wales’s outfits. “She wants the focus to be on the really important issues, the people and the causes she is spotlighting,” the royal insider said. “There will always be an appreciation of what the Princess is wearing from some of the public and she gets that. But do we need to be officially always saying what she is wearing? No.” The story raised so many eyebrows that a Kensington Palace spokesperson felt the need to backtrack—taking responsibility for the comments before concluding, somewhat confusingly: “To be clear, there has been no change in our approach to sharing information about Her Royal Highness’s clothing.”\n\nRegardless of whether the Palace has changed its tack when it comes to fashion credits, Kate’s wardrobe has remained, as ever, prim, proper and predominantly Catherine Walker-led thus far in 2025 (although she has, on occasion, recycled noughties pieces, such as a Ralph Lauren jacket she first wore in Cheltenham back in 2007). For today’s Wales v England match in Cardiff, however, the Princess wore the polar opposite of a headline-generating look: a navy, military-style coat over a classic black turtleneck.",

from the sun.\n\nThe Therabody face thing.\n\nAnd this is how you know it's mine,\n\nbecause that, something spilled in my luggage.\n\nAnd you can use the cold function,\n\nor you can use the heat function.\n\nI'm using cold because mama didn't sleep.\n\nAnd it stays cold.\n\nI used to just use like a little bowl of ice in the morning.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThe thing about ice is it melts.\n\nIt doesn't stay as cold as I would like.\n\nAnd in this case, yes, I am going inside to outside,\n\nbecause I'm trying to push that inflammation,\n\nthat swelling right on out.\n\nSo, I am a device sucker!\n\nI love a device.\n\nSo, sometimes, you gotta go to the Shani Darden.\n\nThis is when I need backup.\n\nMy whole face is vibrating.\n\nI met Shani when I was doing a little show,\n\ncalled L.A.'s Finest\n\nwith one of her best friends, Jessica Alba,\n\nJessica swears by Shani.\n\nAnd so, Shani's a homegirl now.\n\nIf I had a hero product, it's the resurfacing compound.\n\nI started using U Beauty in September,\n\nabout this much I use,\n\nI've never gotten more compliments on my face.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWell, I wish I was the one who got my husband into skincare.\n\nWe have the same amazing facialists.\n\nThe more he started doing work on TV\n\nand retired from the NBA,\n\nhe was like, Oh, I need to get into a routine.\n\nAnd he moved this beautiful chair\n\nthat was in our living room into his bathroom.\n\nBecause he really likes\n\nto luxuriate during his skincare routine.\n\nIt's quite cute.\n\nThis is the vitamin B brightening serum.\n\nUse exactly what the directions say,\n\nbecause I have a problem with that.\n\nIf it says like a dime size, girl,\n\nI'm going for a half a dollar.\n\nAnd with all the things I've used thus far,\n\nyou have to commit to sunscreen.\n\nBecause these products left without any protection\n\nfrom the sun will work against you.\n\nWe have the U Beauty, the return.\n\nThis right here helps to bring these girls back.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nKaavia is obsessed with beauty, all things beauty.\n\nShe is the girliest girl ever.\n\nAnd she loves more makeup.\n\nShe's not really into like the skincare part of it.\n\nBut makeup?\n\nChild, she could do a beat.\n\nShe does eyes better than me.\n\nBut Zaya definitely has a skincare routine.\n\nI mean, but she's also,\n\nwhen you're walking the runways of Miu Miu,\n\nshe's gotten very much into skincare\n\nand the whole like having her own beauty routine.\n\nI don't know who else out there has a problem\n\nwith TikTok Shop.\n\nI can't stop myself.\n\nThe Babe Lash lash serum,\n\nthe new organic lash serum.\n\nAnd I use one on one eye and the other on this one.\n\nAnd I just wanna see which one is better.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSunscreen, I go 50 and it's Invisible Sunscreen Gel\n\nand it just disappears right into my face.\n\nHonestly, I didn't think black people needed to,\n\nI didn't think we needed to wear sunscreen.\n\nAnd that was a lie!\n\nBecause I used to think,\n\nOh my God!\n\nLook at all these freckles and moles.\n\nThey are so cute.\n\nAnd then, they started changing shape\n\nand I had to get them removed.\n\nMy girl Winnie Harlow came up\n\nwith this line called Cay Skin.\n\nThis is her lip balm, which I'm obsessed with.\n\nChocolate for the chocolate girls.\n\nBut I also discovered probably around 40\n\nwhen I was going through a lot of hormonal issues\n\nthat if I give up gluten, dairy, alcohol and caffeine,\n\nI was getting rid of a lot of inflammation\n\nand a lot of those perimenopausal challenges,\n\nhormonal challenges kind of disappeared the more I worked\n\non eliminating inflammation.\n\nSo, I'm just doing tinted moisturizer.\n\nToday, we're gonna go with the Laura Mercier slanted brush.\n\nI'm just gonna load her up like that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe beautiful thing\n\nabout more people getting into the beauty business,\n\nis that there's so many more options\n\nand there's so many more FUBU options, For Us, By Us.\n\nThere was a time though where I'd go to work\n\nand they wouldn't have the shade, child\n\nand I would look gray.\n\nSo, you start bringing your own makeup,\n\nyou start buying your own makeup.\n\nSo, now, you're paying for things\n\nthat you shouldn't have to pay for.\n\nAnd it's completely unfair and it still happens.\n\nAnd there was a time\n\nwhere there were only a few brown girls.\n\nThey're like, Be lucky girl!\n\nAnd I'm like, I don't wanna be the only one.\n\nI want there to be the range of black beauty.\n\nI want you to see the diaspora\n\non screen, behind the screens,\n\nin front of the camera, behind the camera.\n\nBut it's a fight, it's still a fight.\n\nConcealer next.\n\nI use Makeup by Mario, my honey Mario.\n\nI feel like I'm just gonna go with the darker one.\n\nAnd this is number 440.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI think, the first time I got my makeup done professionally,\n\nI had been discovered at Trudys dress shop.\n\nTrudys was known as the prom dress capital of the world.\n\nThis lady comes up and she's like,\n\nWould you ever consider being\n\nin our prom dress commercial?\n\nAnd so, when I was getting my makeup done,\n\nit was the same products\n\nthat you could get at any drugstore,\n\nbut it was the touch, it was the feeling like a star\n\nthat I really loved, I really did love it.\n\nI learned to do my own makeup\n\nwhen I started going to the teen clubs.\n\n[Gabrielle giggles]\n\nAnd I was like, I want a boyfriend.\n\nI don't know if you guys are familiar with Danessa Myricks\n\nand this is magic.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSee, it's giving me a little yellow,\n\nso, maybe, I will go back over it with a little Mario.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSo, my next thing is CHANEL.\n\nIt's a little blush.\n\nSo, sometimes, when you've pulled an all-nighter,\n\nyour eyes might not be as white as you'd like.\n\nAnd these LUMIFY, first of all,\n\nyou can see this is my real stuff,\n\nbecause there's not even a label.\n\nAnd it's just,\n\n[upbeat music]\n\ntake a breath.\n\n[Gabrielle breathes out]\n\nI wasn't meditating, you guys.\n\nI was just thinking about fun songs that I like.\n\nI personally only love songs if they came out before 1995.\n\nAnd that's mainly because I know the lyrics.\n\nSo, this morning, it was Dionne Warwick.\n\n♪ Do you know the way to San Jose

Fenty classic\n\nand I literally have 51100 of these\n\nin every purse, every drawer.\n\nKaavia has taken several.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Gabrielle mouths sounds]\n\nThey're glossy, they're luscious.\n\nI still want more lip glosses.\n\nSo, I'm not gonna be the friend that's like,\n\nRi, where's the album?\n\nI'm not asking, 'cause I'm like, More please.\n\nSo, this is Damone Roberts,

sophisticated,\n\nbut it just made me look mean.\n\nI'm not really mean.\n\nI played a lot of mean girls, which is fun.\n\nBut I'm so my mother's child from Nebraska.\n\nI'm still trying to give my neighbors May Day gifts.\n\nAnd I don't know if that's just a Midwest thing.\n\nI have been anxious since I was 19.\n\nAnd at 19, I was sexually assaulted,\n\na story I've talked about many, many times.\n\nBut after that, I got PTSD.\n\nAnd a part of that is I just have extreme anxiety\n\nabout everything,\n\nwhich I have been working on for the last 25-plus years\n\nwith the same therapist with varying degrees of success.\n\nAs I've gotten older, it's gotten a little better.\n\nIt's a lifetime thing.\n\nAnd this is my Victoria Beckham.\n\nWhen I get really, really anxious,\n\nI talk to myself and I say,\n\nWhat's the worst that can happen?\n\nWhat is the absolute worst thing that can happen right now?\n\nIt's not gonna happen, you're okay.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work, it's the 10 deep breaths.\n\nDo they make me a little lightheaded?\n\nYes, they do, but the anxiety slowly dissipates.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI'm one of these people\n\nthat this feels like a surgical tool.\n\nWhen

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "When it comes to selecting powder or cream, “it depends on the level of maturity of the skin, but it’s in the application technique,” Westman says. “If you’ve created a radiant finish using foundation, then you can absolutely either use a powder or a cream blush. It really all depends on the skin’s finish and the preparation you used.”\n\nJenny Patinkin, a makeup artist and the founder of Jenny Patinkin Eco-Luxe tools, says: “I generally think that liquid or cream blush is better for mature—or ‘lived-in’ skin as I like to call it—because it has a reflective appearance, even if it’s formulated without any shimmer. A reflected bounce of light off of skin that has started to thin or droop can create the illusion of a smoother, more glowy appearance. Not to mention that as skin ages it doesn't retain moisture as well, so liquid or cream blushes can also give the appearance of being more hydrated and plump.”\n\nAs for powder blush, Patinkin doesn’t generally recommend it for everyday wear on mature skin. “Powder blush formulated with shimmer can give the same effect of making the skin appear more glowy and fresh, but that’s mostly when you view it either on camera or from a distance,” she says. “Close up, powder blush with shimmer can settle into fine lines and pores, which can make them appear more pronounced.”\n\nWestman adds a caveat: Powder blush can work on mature skin types, but only if the skin has been properly prepped—and that’s particularly true for those with moisture loss. “If your skin is very dry to the touch, you would need to add some sort of radiance, whether that be from your moisturizer or a skin enhancer, to ensure the skin feels a bit more alive,” she says. “If skin is prepped, it will ensure the products are blending seamlessly together for a softer finish.” That soft finish is key to Westman’s general makeup philosophy for aging skin. “Less is more, especially with mature skin,” she notes. “You don’t want to overdo it.”",

However, when I heard Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis would be reprising their mother-daughter roles in a Freaky Friday reboot inventively titled…Freakier Friday, I knew immediately just how seated I would be for said film.\n\nWhile Freakier Friday isn’t out in theaters until August 8, we’ve officially been blessed with a trailer as of this Friday (shrewd release date on Disney’s part, IMO).

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "If you’re seeking to achieve an airbrushed complexion, the best pore minimizing primers can do the trick, smoothing things over and helping you achieve the illusion of a seemingly poreless face. “Larger pores tend to make skin appear more textured and oily after hours of makeup,” explains celebrity makeup artist Brittany Whitfield. “A pore minimizing primer creates a film over the porous areas, ensuring the foundation can lay smoothly across the skin.”\n\nVogue’s Favorite Pore Minimizing Primers\n\nIn This Story\n\nBut there’s a difference between blurring primers (a.k.a. pore minimizing primers) and standard ones: “Generally speaking, a traditional primer’s core mission is to boost the staying power of the makeup,” Whitfield says, explaining that a pore minimizing primer takes matters a step further by using ingredients like silicone and plant-derived waxes to fill in enlarged pores.\n\n“If you have larger pores, your best friends are products with niacinamide, alpha hydroxy acid, beta hydroxy acid, and retinol. These will improve your skin texture and tighten your pores with continued use,” celebrity makeup artist Glenn Brownell tells Vogue, adding that many pore-minimizing primers include these ingredients to treat the appearance of enlarged pores and excess oil production over time.

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Most people consider fashion to be a relentlessly forward-facing industry, but as anyone who has studied the runways with more than casual interest will know, it’s a world steeped in nostalgia. Rare is the runway trend that hasn’t already had a turn (or three) around the sun in the past. And while creative directors looking to bygone eras is certainly not a new phenomenon, it has kicked into a higher gear over the last decade, as designers lean into the power of the past—particularly when it comes to iconic moments from their own house archives.\n\nUnder Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior has orientated its references towards the classic Bar jackets and circle skirts of the 1950s. But if the brand’s latest collection is anything to go by, that could all be set to change. The fall 2025 show revived a hit from its more recent past: former creative director John Galliano’s iconic “J’Adore Dior” tees, which became famous in the Noughties, in no small part thanks to appearances in the Sex and the City universe. Lucy Liu wore it for her season four cameo, and Carrie Bradshaw later wore one in the film Sex and the City 2.\n\nDior fall 2025 Dior fall 2025\n\nThe J’Adore Dior tee 2.0 has been rendered in charcoal-grey jersey and printed with the famed fade-effect lettering. For 2025, Chiuri overlaid the look with gothic lace and styled it with tough leathers, brocade corsetry and whip-cracking riding boots: a far cry from both the girl band cargos that Liu championed back in 2002 and Carrie’s characteristically extra Abu Dhabi souk attire (a purple puffball skirt and a silk cropped jacket).\n\nWhile I have no doubt that Dior will not be short of buyers for its revamped tee, I will be diving into the archive and sourcing an original to shop second-hand, an idea that eBay’s pre-loved style director, Amy Bannerman, is in full support of. “Not only is it more sustainable, but they can also be found at a fraction of their new prices,” she says. “It’s the best way to get your hands on authentic pieces from past eras.”",

        "content": "If there’s one thing The White Lotus is going to do, it’s introduce a guy-on-guy incest plotline as casually as some shows bring out a major celebrity for a Very Special Episode cameo. Remember the furor that erupted online when the series’s Sicily-set second season introduced uncle-nephew gay sex to the non-Pornhub cultural lexicon? Well, now Mike White—in his infinite bisexual wisdom—has extended that theme to season three in Thailand, giving hilariously awful dude-bro Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger) and his sweet, malleable younger brother Lochlan (Sam Nivola) the opportunity to lock lips while out of their respective minds on drugs at a full-moon party.\n\nThe suggestion of sexuality between the two brothers has been breadcrumbed ever since the season’s first episode, when Saxon spoke to Lochlan about his airplane-induced horniness and tried to school him in the art of being a sexist creep to women trying to unwind in peace (excuse me, I mean: “in the art of seduction”). Plus, the two are sharing a room at the White Lotus Thailand, which Saxon more or less insists upon in order to keep their sister, Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook), out of the loop—a fact that takes on somewhat more sinister, sexual undertones after last night’s episode. I mean, that’s got to be a hell of a morning-after confrontation around the breakfast buffet, right?\n\nUltimately, seeing the show actually go there feels like a timely reminder that The White Lotus will always find a way to get viewers talking around the proverbial watercooler, even if said talk is along the lines of, “Why did I just watch two brothers make out on a prestige television show?” Below, find the very best social media reactions to The White Lotus’s brother-on-brother kiss:",

The best dressed stars of the week continued the spirit we saw at the shows in New York and Europe, embracing a sense of drama that ranged from low-key (think: subtle suiting) to high-key (think: modern evening gowns with tons of shimmering sequins).\n\nThe more stealthily chic looks of the week included Cate Blanchett, who stepped out in New York wearing a brand new Tom Ford look. The pale pink suit, paired with an electric green bowed blouse, was color-blocking done right. At the premiere of The Actor in New York, actor Gemma Chan also slipped into a sleek Khaite suit that featured a cropped tuxedo jacket. Both looks proved that with a slight update like, say, a sheer top or an unexpected color combo, suiting up can feel entirely fresh.\n\nThere were also bolder style wins on the step and repeats. At SXSW, Daisy Edgar-Jones slipped into a green sequin and sheer design that was fresh off the runway by Gucci; Ruth Negga also embraced gold sequins in Prada, at the premiere of Number One on the Call Sheet in Hollywood. While shimmer is never out in Hollywood, their contemporary silhouettes—like Negga’s crop top and low-backed skirt pairing—made for a new and unexpected take on disco ball dressing.\n\nWhich were your favorite celebrity looks this week?

[laughs]\n\nIt's pretty empty 'cause I clearly use it a lot.\n\nI try not to exfoliate too much,\n\nmaybe like twice a week or something.\n\nAnd then I mainly go in around my nose\n\nand then I'm gonna go on my lips.\n\nOne day she's dry, one day she's oily.\n\nMuch like my personality. [laughs]\n\nI use body lotion on my face before I put my makeup on\n\njust 'cause it doesn't roll.\n\nYou know when you use certain moisturizers\n\nand they react to your makeup and then it starts rolling.\n\nAnd I usually do my makeup when I'm in a rush,\n\nso I haven't got time for that.\n\nSo I love to use La Roche-Posay. [laughs]\n\nThere's no other way of saying it, La Roche-Posay.\n\nBut in Simone's world it's La Roshay Posay. [laughs]\n\nThen I just like to put that all over my face.\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to use like hand lotion\n\nand now I've upgraded to slightly fancier body lotion.\n\nAnd then just to finish off, I'm gonna use a teeny tiny bit\n\nof sunscreen.\n\n[music continues]\n\nMy skin is prepped\n\nand ready to have some makeup on it.\n\nI kind of work backwards with my makeup.\n\nSo I'm actually gonna start with my lip gloss.\n\nI wanna see the vision\n\nas it's developing, if you know what I mean.\n\nSo I start with a little lip gloss.\n\nPlump Ambition [laughs] from L'Oreal.\n\nThat's my nickname. [laughs]\n\nLips are locked and getting loaded\n\n'cause we'll go back to them at the end.\n\nBut I can feel them like sizzling away\n\nand they're having a bit of a party.\n\nI am then gonna go in with my blush.\n\nI actually sometimes just use a little bit\n\nof the lipstick color that I'm gonna eventually use.\n\nI'm gonna go in with this Armani one.\n\nIt's called Lip Power.\n\nLittle bit, they can be friends.\n\nI actually realize I don't need to put as much on\n\nas I might think I do.\n\nYou know when you're in high school\n\nand you start experimenting\n\nand learning how to do your makeup,\n\nI always loved like a clumpy mascara and I still kind of do.\n\nSo my eyebrows are a little bit crazy.\n\nThey're kind of sparse.\n\nCan you see?\n\nThere's like little gaps in them, which is fine.\n\nI like to stain the skin just a little bit.\n\nAnd then I go in with another brow pencil and I fluff it up.\n\nMe and this eyebrow, we're not friends.\n\nThis one just, there we go.\n\nSo then I go in with my Anastasia eyebrow pencil\n\nin granite or dark brown.\n\n[music continues]\n\nEyebrows are now done.\n\nHappy with those.\n\nTea break.\n\nGirls with dark skin, color correcter changed my life.\n\nI had never really understood what it was\n\nuntil a few years ago.\n\nI get a lot of shadow around my mouth\n\nand color corrector just kind of balances out the shadow.\n\nI go in with my brush\n\nand then do a little bit here, a little bit there.\n\nI think when I was younger I was picking out color tones\n\nthat were maybe a lit a bit too light for me.\n\nAnd then I started just buying stuff, whatever worked\n\nfor me at work on set\n\nand I just stuck to that shade for a bit.\n\nAnd then maybe on another job I'd be like,\n\nOh, this one's actually better.\n\nI would just kind of follow what the pros are using.\n\nI've got a little friend over here, so we're just gonna\n\nask him to go away.\n\nMy first experience as an actor was for a kids show\n\nand they asked me if I was okay with my makeup\n\nand I was sat in the chair and they were like,\n\nOh, you happy with everything?\n\nAnd I was like, Me?\n\nLike, you're asking if I am okay with my makeup?\n\nAnd I wasn't used to, I just thought I was,\n\nI had to do what I was told.\n\nAnd they were like, No, it's your face.\n\nThen I really started watching\n\nhow people were doing my makeup\n\nand learn what I liked and what I didn't like.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of a tinted moisturizer.\n\nI like using this Urban Decay one in shade 70.\n\nNeeds some waking up.\n\nCome on, come on. [laughs]\n\nI've put a little bit, literally teeny tiny bit.\n\nThis is actually, I would say this is too much.\n\nI really don't like going out on a date\n\nor going out with my friends and the makeup\n\nlike over a few hours I start noticing it.\n\nI just wanna forget that I've even got makeup on my face.\n\nSo less is more for me.\n\n[music continues]\n\nAnd then this guy's really annoying me.\n\nMy forehead, I don't like,\n\nI don't put too much makeup on there,\n\n'cause that's where I'm prone to getting spots\n\nand unwanted visitors.\n\nI remember Sex Education kind of well,\n\nit feels like years ago.\n\nWe all auditioned for the same role\n\nand then they kind of workshopped characters around us.\n\nAnd that's when I suggested Olivia like had bubble gum\n\nand blue bubbles and stuff.\n\nAnd she wasn't really a mean girl,\n\nshe was just finding her way.\n\nAnd the more I rewatch watch the series, you realize\n\nthat she's just finding her identity still.\n\nI'm gonna go in with a little bit of concealer now.\n\nOh holy concealer.\n\nWhat would we do without you?\n\nFeeling tired?\n\nConcealer.\n\nGot a spot?\n\nConcealer.\n\nI use the shade Walnut.\n\nThis is my NARS concealer.\n\nJesse actually used this on me in Bridgerton\n\nand I never looked back.\n\n[music continues]\n\nBridgerton feels very transformative.\n\nI turn up at 5:00 AM in my pajamas\n\nand then hours later I step out looking like a viscountess,\n\nwhich is just amazing.\n\nI think the girls on Bridgerton really, we all go\n\nthrough such a transformation with the wigs and the makeup\n\nand the dresses.\n\nIt's such a dream.\n\nEvery season I fall in love with Kate's looks more and more.\n\nHer makeup looks are just so, they started off very plain.\n\nShe wasn't wearing much makeup.\n\nAnd then the softer she got, the more lashes were fluttering\n\nand the more color were on her cheeks.\n\nAnd a little bit of lip stick, lip color.\n\nI learnt so much from the makeup department on Bridgerton\n\nand I wish I could say it was my real hair, but it's not.\n\nIt's a wig.\n\nI can't say anything about this season.\n\nI would say as the characters progress, their makeup,\n\ntheir hair, their costumes, all progress with them.\n\nI'm gonna attempt a little bit of eye makeup.\n\nI would happily step out like this, with a bit of mascara,\n\nbut I'm gonna make an effort.\n\nI've got this Rare Beauty bronzing stick.\n\nI'm gonna just get my ring finger\n\nand dab it on my eyelids a little bit like that.\n\nAnd just put it on the lid.\n\nWe're gonna bring it down to the lash line there.\n\nMy mom didn't wear too much makeup.\n\nShe always wore like kohl eyeliner, very Indian.\n\nI'm just gonna get this guy\n\nand I'm just gonna go on like my waterline.\n\nToday I'm in a rush,\n\nso I'm just gonna use a crayon eyeliner,\n\nthe same one I used to stain my eyebrows.\n\nI want to just go in a tiny, tiny bit.\n\nI might be a little bit too smoky.\n\nSo we're just gonna go in with my brush.\n\nAnd then it has a little, it has a jacket. [laughs]\n\nI'm really excited for this year.\n\nI've got some very cool things going on.\n\nOne being the first movie I've ever produced.\n\nPicture This, which is my rom-com.\n\nSo I'm very tired. [laughs]\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nI had lots of creative control,\n\nwhich was really important for me\n\nbecause I grew up watching Bridget Jones\n\nand all the classic studio rom-coms back in the nineties.\n\nAnd I always wanted to be that girl.\n\nI never really saw anyone that looked like me.\n\nSo I was like, you know what, if we're gonna do this,\n\nlet's try and do it right.\n\nSo I had creative say on the character quite a lot,\n\non Pia's character and her background, which was super fun.\n\nAnd I was just really grateful that I could have,\n\nyou know, that the team at 42mp trusted me with that.\n\nI'm gonna use my mascara, which is my L'Oreal Paradise.\n\nNot just Paradise.\n\nIt's Paradise Big Deal. [laughs]\n\nAnd then I also have the F1 movie coming out this year.\n\nIt's produced by Louis Hamilton.\n\nI would say that's one of the dream movies\n\nthat I've ever been part of.\n\nThat was an incredible experience.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with this guy.\n\n[music continues]\n\nWhen I have downtime, when I'm not filming or in the studio\n\nor doing press, I'll go to the banya, which is\n\nlike a sauna and do ice baths and sweat it all out.\n\nI have such a tight knit of girlfriends\n\nand friends in my community in London\n\nand I just hang out with them really.\n\nAnd time with my dog.\n\nMy dog!\n\nLook, I've got this little necklace that has her face on it.\n\nI'm just gonna go in with a little bit of lip gloss.\n\nSo let's take the hair down.\n\nLet's give it a bit of a zhuzh.\n\nI think it's very minimal.\n\nI didn't use too much products on my skin,\n\nso I feel like I'm gonna last all night.\n\nThis was so much fun\n\nand I hope it was helpful for anyone who wants\n\nto learn how to do their makeup\n\nor any girls with skin similar to mine.\n\nWe're gonna put on some Whitney Houston\n\nor some George Michael and dance around\n\nwith an espresso martini.\n\nBye Vogue, thank you.

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "This story contains mentions of gender-based violence and spoilers for the Netflix series Adolescence.\n\nIf you’re a faithful student of what’s trending on Netflix, you might not need any introduction to Adolescence: The British limited series, following the arrest of a 13-year-old boy for a female classmate’s murder, delves deep into thorny territory of how our society has socialized young men and boys to treat the women in their lives as inferior (increasingly with fatal results).\n\nWhile it may be tempting to dismiss the actions of men who enact violence against women as monstrous, Adolescence connects the dots between the global domination of social media and the rising normalization of cultural misogyny to demonstrate just how easy it is for children like Jamie, the show’s protagonist (played by Owen Cooper), to get dangerous and even deadly messages about their roles in society. If you haven’t watched the show yet, or want a primer on its admittedly difficult content before diving in, we’ve got you covered; below, find everything you need to know about Adolescence.\n\nWhat is Adolescence about?\n\nAdolescence can be understood, very broadly, as a dark warning about the potential ramifications of incel culture and the radicalization of young men online. In the Netflix series, a 13-year-old boy named Jamie Miller is arrested on the suspicion of murder and presented with CCTV footage of himself fatally stabbing a female classmate named Katie Leonard. The show follows Jamie and his family from the police interrogation room to the school that he and Katie attended and the youth psychiatric facility where he later awaits trial, jumping forward a year in its final episode to find Jamie preparing to plead guilty while his family attempts to return to some version of normalcy.\n\nWho stars in Adolescence, and what else do I know them from?\n\nOwen Cooper, who portrays Jamie, is a newcomer to the industry—as one might expect, given that he's only 15. However, he has several upcoming projects listed on IMDb, including a role as young Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s 2026 adaptation of Wuthering Heights.\n\nAdolescence’s co-creator Stephen Graham, who plays Jamie’s father, Eddie, has been nominated for a whopping eight BAFTA Awards. He is perhaps best known for his roles in Peaky Blinders, Boiling Point, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\n\nChristine Tremarco, who plays Owen’s mother, Manda, has starred on British series including Safe House, Little Boy Blue, Tin Star, and Wolfe.\n\nIs Adolescence based on a true story?\n\nWhile Adolescence’s story wasn’t ripped directly from the headlines, the ongoing scourge of gender-based violence in the UK and elsewhere definitely served as an inspiration to Graham and his co-creator Jack Thorne. “There was an incident where a young boy (allegedly) stabbed a girl,” Graham told Tudum recently, adding: “It shocked me. I was thinking, ‘What’s going on? What’s happening in society where a boy stabs a girl to death? What’s the inciting incident here?’ And then it happened again, and it happened again, and it happened again. I really just wanted to shine a light on it, and ask, ‘Why is this happening today? What’s going on? How have we come to this?’\"\n\nHow many episodes of Adolescence are there?\n\nUnfortunately, there are only four episodes of Adolescence in the Netflix series’s first (and likely only) season. “We knew that we wanted to end it in that room. We wanted the journey to finish where it began,” creator Stephen Graham told Tudum. “This is where the person who Jamie became was created.”",

        "title": "Recession Blonde: How Economic Uncertainty Spurred the Latest Hair Color Trend",
        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Whether there's truth to these indicators or you chalk it up to mere coincidences, there have been many times when fashion and beauty trends have correctly predicted a recession. The Hemline Index, for example, is a theory created by economist George Taylor in 1926 that suggested the length of a hemline is closely related to how well the economy is doing. Shorter hemlines indicate a thriving economy (think the Roaring ‘20s and the flapper dress or the ‘60s and the birth of the mini skirt) while longer hemlines show an economy that is not (floor-length dresses and pants dominated fashion during The Great Depression). In 2009, the media coined the term “recession hair,” which saw many forgo their regular haircut and styling appointments as a result of the stock market crash of 2008. Now in 2025, TikTok takes it one step further and goes hair color-specific with “recession blonde.”\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research has yet to officially declare a recession in the U.S. But with the stock market in free fall, many industries facing massive layoffs, a trade war affecting many of our imported goods, and egg prices continuing to rise, it’s all starting to trickle down to how everyone wants to spend (or save) their money—especially when it comes to their hair routines.\n\nWhat is “recession blonde?”\n\nRecession blonde (or recession brunette) refers to the darker, more brown-tinted hue that many are letting grow in with their normally bright, golden strands. TikTok users explain that while it may look like “old-money blonde,” letting their natural roots grow actually points to how the economy is affecting their spending habits; many are opting out of their touch-up appointments to save money.\n\nWhile cost still depends on where you get your color done, upkeep for blonde hair can be quite the investment and oftentimes the more expensive option. “There are so many complexities to being blonde, and so many different methods to get to the end goal,” celebrity colorist Jenna Perry tells Vogue. “A double process, hyper blonde, is one of the most labor-intensive on your colorist to provide the biggest blonde impact. Highlights generally feel more natural, although the final may look effortless. A skilled application is akin to that of a trained painter and [cost] ranges depending on your colorist as well.”\n\nOlivia Casanova, colorist and co-owner of IGK salon, agrees. In her salons, located in SoHo and the Upper East Side of Manhattan, blonde highlights and touch-ups can range anywhere from $200 with a junior colorist to $600 with a senior colorist. Lower maintenance color treatments such as a face-framing highlight or partial highlight are on the lower end of pricing, says Casanova, but pricing can still be circumstantial. “Roughly, you can save about $100 to $300 a session as opposed to a higher maintenance blonde [dye job],” she says. “Again, this is dependent on your natural hair color, desired goal, and which colorist you want to see, etc.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "The top 12 trends of the fall 2025 season—which range from cozy to cubist and are designed for work and play—somehow manage to navigate smoothly through a time as distorted as a reflection in a funhouse mirror. It’s not that designers are burying their heads in the sand, “You know, it’s in the air, this sort of darkness,” said R13’s Chris Leba, summing up the general mood. It’s no surprise, then, that many collections had a Gothic or Emo sensibility that acknowledged this vibe.\n\nFight or flight is the instinctual response to fear, and resistance was one of the rallying cries of the season (note the many references to armor). Some designers substituted escapism for physical retreat, conjuring free-flying birds or referencing the comforts of home where you can pull the covers over your head for a little while. Clothes that can cocoon and embrace their wearers were all over the runways, as were soft textures—most notably and inexplicably faux fur—which can activate an ASMR response. Yet if the season were to be personified, it would be as an iron hand in a velvet glove, as control and comfort are contraposed.\n\nAt a time when the manosphere is ascendent, power and the female body (or “the accessories of femininity” as Miuccia Prada put it) have become lighting rods. It wasn’t so long ago that women were excluded from the world of work. When they started climbing the corporate ladder in the 1980s—the era that underpins so much of what we are seeing now—they often borrowed from “the boys.” Tailoring, neckties, and linebacker shoulders are back and as big as ever. And concurrent with the fizzling out of Work From Home, the TikTok generation has become fascinated with Dress for Success uniforms, and Working Girl’s Tess McGill, spawning the terms corpcore and office siren.\n\nSirens are enchanters, and for fall, designers have once again fallen for the hourglass curves of yesteryear. Mae West’s hourglass silhouette inspired Schiaparelli’s Shocking perfume bottle (which in turn influenced Jean Paul Gaultier’s flacons), all torsos that closely resemble a Stockman mannequin, i.e. perfection. With Ozempic in play, beauty ideals seem to be retreating to old standards where traditionally small waists represented discipline and hips (augmented with pads or peplums for fall), fecundity. While some designers sculpted silhouettes, others celebrated the female form by draping the natural body using clothing with no (visible) supports, much like Christo and Jeanne-Claude transformed architectural monuments with cloth. For those simply looking to be immortalized in street style, a touch of neon should do the trick.",

        "content": "You thought the method dressing was over? Uh uh, method dressing is forever, at least for Timothée Chalamet—until the next role-of-a-lifetime comes along, or the parcels of Bob Dylan ephemera pillaged from the online auction houses stop coming through the young actor’s door that is.\n\nPosting to Instagram, the SAG award-winning actor took a moment to shout out the team behind him. “Some of you have been rocking with me for over seven years now,” he wrote, “know how deeply grateful I am…And once it’s seven years plus it isn’t a fad [sic] lol, ur with me for life now.” He tagged a host of collaborators, from his stylist Taylor McNeill to director and photographer Aidan Zamiri and groomer Jamie Taylor. But looking aside from the very sweet caption, what caught the most eagle of eyes in the accompanying pic? The denim patchwork jacket. Strap in.\n\nBack in January, legendary auction house Julien’s ran an expansive catalogue of Bob Dylan memorabilia: “Celebrating Bob Dylan: The Aronowitz Archive & More.” Julien’s hosts an array of artefacts and unique collections from Elvis Presley to Marilyn Monroe, Ringo Starr, Kurt Cobain, and Lady Gaga. This lot featured pieces like a 1983 Fender Japan TL-52 electric guitar owned by Dylan, oil paintings, a signed harmonica, and handwritten lyrics for “Blowin’ in the Wind.”\n\nLot #55 was a hand embellished and trimmed denim Levi’s jacket, with velvet, lace, and textile patches that Dylan wore in the 1987 movie Hearts of Fire. Dylan wears it in one of the film’s central scenes, as his character Billy Parker punches Rupert Everett’s character James Holt. Fun fact, it’s the film where Dylan utters the line “You know I guess I’ve always known I was never one of them rock ‘n’ roll singers that was gonna win any Nobel prize.” Huh!",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nWelcome to Vanity Fair Oscar Party live. This is the hottest party of the year and the\n\none place where anything can happen. Hello everybody. I'm Tan France and I'm so excited to be back\n\nhere live at Vanity Fair's legendary Oscar bash, here in the heart of Beverly Hills.\n\nThe stars are pouring in to celebrate Hollywood's most iconic night as a designer. You know, I'm all about the fashion, and we\n\nalready have had the most amazing looks. There have been so many incredible ones. There's already, uh, Kelly Rowland on the red\n\ncarpet. Looks incredible. We've had Sarah Paulson, who gave us the most\n\nincredible moment. Selma Blair looked magical. Old Hollywood.\n\nUm. Oh, gosh. Who do we have here?\n\nLooking like a vision in gold. But let's kick things off. Let's really get things going with the\n\nwonderful Ben Stiller and his wife, Christine. Hi, Ben.\n\nGood to see you. Hi, Christine. Good to see you.\n\nHi. You lot. How are you?\n\nI'm so. well, I would love to really focus on you and I promise I'm going to come back.\n\nBut your wife, Christine, you look like a knockout.\n\nThank you so much. Do you get a temp check from Ben before you head out of the house?\n\nI do, you do? I feel like he's my biggest fan. Oh, I know.\n\nI mean, this is. Yeah. This was very special, though.\n\nWould you tell her if you were like, honey, I don't know. No, no no, no, I'd say that's the\n\nright answer. That is the right answer. That is the right answer.\n\nNow, can I gush real quick about severance? Oh. Thank you.\n\nNo thank you. I was obsessed with season one. I saw Adam last year, and I'm sure you get\n\nthis reaction a lot at the end of the season. One, I literally stood up from my sofa and held the TV because I couldn't believe that\n\nthat's the way you ended it. Um, the installation you did for the launch of season two was wild.\n\nGrand central station? Yes. Yeah.\n\nUm, can you tell me what the response has been from the audience for season two? It's been so exciting because we were off the\n\nair for three years, as you know. Yeah. And we had a really strong sort of almost\n\nlike a cult audience. I think for the first season, people who were so into it.\n\nBut it wasn't, I don't think, huge numbers. And then the second season, we were offered three years and we came back and somehow a\n\nlot of people discovered us, and we're really happy about that.\n\nI don't know if you know this, Ben, I think. Have you been to England much? Do you know what a tenner is?\n\nWhen I say a tenner, it means 10 pounds. Okay. You might owe me a tenner or 20.\n\nBecause I am the reason that so many people tuned in for season two. I have told everyone I know.\n\nThank you everyone, and I've said it a thousand times over. It's one of the greatest shows I've ever seen\n\nin my entire life. I loved it so much. Thank you everybody who works on the show.\n\nWe have such an amazing team of people making the show so incredible, incredible, um, I did this might be a little controversial, but I'm\n\ngoing to go here. You're one for clapping back on social.\n\nMhm. Um. Oh yeah.\n\nUh, which is really surprising. Yeah. Was it just a night I find it fun.\n\nWas it just one night thing, or are you just like, you just want to comment on what you're seeing?\n\nIt depends. It just depends what mood I'm in. By the way, you're moving your hand.\n\nI'm like, you've got an opinion. I want to hear it. No, no.\n\nDo you tell him not to? I always say do not engage. Yeah, but sometimes you feel like engaging\n\nand you give it a shot. I get, but to be honest, it's hard not to engage.\n\nYeah. Okay, on that note, go engage with everyone behind me.\n\nEnjoy your night. You both look gorgeous. Thank you.\n\nLovely. Lovely to see you. Amazing.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you, thank you. Okay.\n\nWhen it comes to pop culture, no one has their finger on the pulse. Quite like Hannah Berner and Paige Desorbo,\n\naka the Giggly Squad, who are here to chat with the stars the only way they can. Hello, ladies.\n\nWhat's going on? Hello, tan. No, the giggly squad is here.\n\nWe are so scared right now. It's a lot of yelling, but the best people watching I've ever seen.\n\nAnd let's not make her wait anymore. Amy Poehler, can you come in away from us, Amy?\n\nGet right in the middle. Tom. Get in here!\n\nOkay. Stunning. Stunning.\n\nThank you. Thank you. So, since when are women in comedy just so\n\nbeautiful? Since 2025. Since 2025.\n\nSomething happened in the planets. No. Women have always been beautiful and funny.\n\nHave you ever done anything crazy to prepare for a night like this? Ooh.\n\nLike a salmon. Salmon like facial or something. Like a mucin situation?\n\nYeah. I wish I don't do. I don't think I do enough.\n\nEvery time I like, I, you know, I ate a croissant today, which is like, I don't do enough.\n\nYou wrapped yourself in velvet, and I love that. Thank you very much.\n\nI gorgeous. I had the trifecta tonight, which never happens where I liked how.\n\nI'm just going to say I like how I look, which never happens. You can say that Timothée Chalamet say I want\n\nto be one of the greatest. You're the greatest of how you look like the Michael Jordan of this party.\n\nYes. Um, and, um, and I liked how it looked. I had fun with my date, and my feet don't\n\nhurt though. That's it. It's only going downhill from here, Amy.\n\nWhen you go in there, what are you at a party like? Are you the wallflower?\n\nI cannot wait to leave. Yeah, yeah, I get that. I cannot wait to get in there so I can do a\n\nlap and then leave. I heard they have the best food, like at this party.\n\nI saw an In-N-Out truck. Fantastic. Yeah.\n\nNow, Amy, you've had some of the most viral moments in the world. Do you feel pressure?\n\nThe whole world, at least. America. Do you feel pressure to, like, outdo your\n\nviral moments, or have you just settled with the greatness that you already have? Thank you so much for saying that.\n\nI do think award shows are kind of funny, and they should be silly and people take them very seriously.\n\nAnd I, you know, it's a big night for a lot of people. I understand they work really hard, but I do\n\nlike it when people goof around. They work hard. But I think when people goof around, it's\n\nfun. So you're saying if you won an Oscar, you wouldn't cry?\n\nI mean, I feel like I feel like I would just disassociate so much. I'm not sure I would cry, but is that the\n\nprice that like you should want? I feel like you have to shed one tear. Even if it's a fake one.\n\nJust shed one. One just a single tear. When you're getting married, if the guy\n\ndoesn't cry. Immediate divorce, divorce I get. I have a lot of feelings about men that cry\n\nat weddings. It's very strange to me. We have time to talk about it.\n\nActually, when they saw we talk about it, they haven't told us to stop yet.\n\nNo. They said. They just said, wrap it up.\n\nThey said, wrap it up. Amy, you're the best. Thank you so much, Amy.\n\nYou look beautiful. We'll send it to Andy over there.\n\nHi, kids. Here's another star lighting up the red carpet.\n\nHe's right there in the screen. Hi, Andy. Look at him.\n\nOh, a corduroy look. He's right there. She's right there.\n\nWhere are you? Holy. Should we talk?\n\nDo you know what? This interview is over. It's these two chatting to each other.\n\nHi, Andy. Good to see you. How are you?\n\nHow are you? Very well. For those who don't know.\n\nLook, I would love to focus on Andy, but I discovered last year that he is married to an icon, Joanna Newsom.\n\nThat's right. I know she couldn't be with us here today. She's hiding away.\n\nShe is. She doesn't do interviews. That's okay.\n\nBut I would like to pretend that you're her tonight. Give me what you got.\n\nHow's life? How's it treating you? Um.\n\nYou've been to this party before. What's it like being married to Andy Samberg? Uh.\n\nOh, boy. I can't answer the last one. Uh, life is beautiful.\n\nOur life is full. Uh, there's music and love flowing out of our home.\n\nI did ask you off camera if she sings around the house and you said yes. Absolutely.\n\nDo you request it, or is she just voluntarily volunteers it? I never have to request it.\n\nGood. Also, it wouldn't matter if I did. Okay, good.\n\nIt happens when? When she wants it to happen. Dream.\n\nAbsolute dream. Um, can you talk about SNL 50? Oh, yeah.\n\nTell me about it. Stressful. Exciting.\n\nCan you believe it's 50? It was stressful for me because I worked on it a lot up until it was happening, and then\n\nit was absolute joy and so much fun and being there and watching it live and seeing so many incredible stars from the history of the show\n\ninteracting and doing comedy together and Paul McCartney performing and Lil Wayne and Paul Simon and like, it was kind of like\n\nrelentlessly incredible. It was very overwhelming. It was one of the most exciting moments in TV\n\nI've seen in a really long time. And the fact that you got to be a part of it is just mind blowing.\n\nIt was cool. I met Bonnie Raitt. All right, we're gonna end there.\n\nYeah. We can't beat that. Thank you so much.\n\nI'll see you at the party. Yeah. It's untoppable.\n\nIt is what it is. Thank you. Tan.\n\nWe're joined by the one and only Vanessa Hudgens. Hi.\n\nNo. Our Lord and savior. Literally.\n\nI'll take it. Have you had any moments yet with any celebs? Like in the bathroom or anything fun in the\n\nline? Have you have you crossed paths with anyone or are you like, pretty cool because you've\n\ndone this for a long time. I mean, I feel like I've been coming here for for a good minute of everyone.\n\nNo, you're definitely not sick of everyone. I feel like the last carpet I did was literally a year ago here.\n\nWow. So, wait, when you were to be back when you were preggers, I was popping.\n\nOh my God. Should we have a baby or not? Great question, Hannah.\n\nGreat question. Yes. Okay, fine.\n\nAnd we'll do it. Yes. Well, Keke Palmer just popped one out.\n\nYou just popped one out. And you guys are, like, iconic in every way. Thank you.\n\nAre you. You do what you can. Yeah.\n\nOkay. Vanessa, also, we have to talk about your dress because it's stunning.\n\nI love a feather. I'm a big feather girl. I think they're so good.\n\nWhat's like your process when you're picking your Vanity Fair? Look, because it's different from other red\n\ncarpets. Yeah. I mean, like, I am that girl who genuinely\n\ntries on a dress, and the first one I try on is always the dress.\n\nIt's like a man. It's like a man. You gotta go with your instincts.\n\nIt's like a man. Yeah. It's dating.\n\nIf you don't know in the first 30s. It's not for you, honey. I have a controversial question.\n\nYes. Side part or middle part? I'm normally a middle part girl.\n\nI know. Tonight we're rocking. Yeah.\n\nAnd I'm so jealous cause I can't pull off a look at that. You can pull off a side.\n\nYou totally can. Believe in yourself. Okay.\n\nThank you. I didn't think I could either. But you just got to go for it.\n\nI'm making this interview about me, and I need to stop. I need to stop.\n\nSo are you. Is there any fashion look that you're kind of or trend that you're kind of over?\n\nI don't know. I mean, nothing really pops to mind.\n\nI mean, I feel like we saw a lot of, like, bigger is better moments. I mean, Cynthia's dress, that Louis Vuitton\n\nwas so iconic. I don't know how she sat. Yeah.\n\nNo, I don't know if she did. It was art. Yeah, it was art.\n\nIt was truly art. The girls are standing on business today. Yeah.\n\nVanessa, thank you so much for stopping by. We'll see you inside. Have fun and welcome back.\n\nYes. And shout out to your baby tan. Back to you.\n\nThank you. Gosh, I love it. Back to me.\n\nPeople are arriving on the carpet. Have you seen them all? They're looking incredible.\n\nWho we got? Serena Williams looking like a vision. VA VA voom has an incredible two.\n\nWho else we got on that red carpet? You know, I can barely see. I'm short sighted.\n\nHere we go. Okay, who have I got? Do you know what?\n\nNever mind. Now let's go to our fellow co-hosts, actor and filmmaker Francesca Scorsese, who's with\n\nSarah Paulson. Okay, so I'm here with Sarah Paulson. Welcome.\n\nThank you. You've worked with Ryan Murphy on so many twisted Tales.\n\nWhat is your favorite horror trope? My favorite horror trope.\n\nOh, God. You know, it's a hard question. The final girl.\n\nI always loved. The final girl. I've been the final girl a couple of times.\n\nThat's true. I'm looking forward to not being the final girl sometimes, but the final girl trope\n\nworks for me. Good. And you've done everything from horror to\n\ndrama. What genre would you like to explore that you haven't yet?\n\nOh, I'd like to do a big stinking comedy because nobody lets me do it.\n\nSince I'm wearing this dress, I feel like comedy will lend itself because, you know, go big or go home is my my motto.\n\nYeah, I love that. That's amazing. And what is the first thing that you plan to\n\ndo when you get into the party? Go straight to the bar. Amazing.\n\nAnd if anyone doesn't say that, they're a loser. Yeah, totally.\n\nI mean, I mean, for all the sober people out there. I don't mean that about you.\n\nI can just, you know, we live in a world now where I'm going to get 22 tweets about how no tweets.\n\nDoes anybody tweet anymore? Okay. I mean, yes, but blue sky, what are we doing\n\nthese days? I don't even really know. I don't even know what it's called.\n\nBlue sky. Blue sky. Sky.\n\nBlue sky. Or blue sky. I mean, I should go inside now, right?\n\nThank you so much. So much. Amazing.\n\nThank you. Kitty, Kitty.\n\nOver your shoulder.\n\nTurn to your right side.\n\nThey say.\n\nThat.\n\nLoving her. Short bang. Yep.\n\nMy face could never pull it off. I'm so jealous.\n\nLook, I mean, am I just meant to stand right next to both of you beautiful women? You guys.\n\nWe're joined by Sofia. Richie. Sofia.\n\nStunning. Thank you guys so much. You're so good.\n\nThank you. I feel like you are the trendiest girl on this carpet right now.\n\nBut you know what? I love you because I feel like you don't even want to be trendy.\n\nYou. You just do things, and then it goes into, like, you're not planning it.\n\nYeah. You know what? I'm really just waking up and living my life.\n\nBut I'm really glad that everyone's on board. No, you are the coolest one here, for sure. She put, like, conditioner on her hair cause\n\nshe was tired and everyone just copied her and was like. And now we put conditioner, coconut oil\n\nbecause my hair was greasy. Yeah. And it worked out.\n\nA lot of power comes. Great responsibility. What's the next trend?\n\nDo you think is going to be happening? Give us what are we going to do?\n\nGuys don't follow trends. That's the next trend. Don't follow a trend.\n\nSo iconic of you to say that was so iconic. Okay, I have a fashion question. Okay.\n\nYou come to a lot of these. You're always like the belle of the ball. You always get on the best dressed list.\n\nWhat's your process like? How do you know when you like a dress and when you don't?\n\nLike, what's your vibe when you're in a fitting? Like, I take a lot of photos in fittings.\n\nThat's a big part of my process. Um, other than that, it's. I have to feel comfortable.\n\nYeah. And I have to feel like a bad bee. Do you ever care what your husband thinks?\n\nOh, 100%. 100%. We've never.\n\nPaige is never asked a man anything. 100%. My husband has good taste.\n\nMy husband has really good taste. I mean, he wears glasses. He's smart so he can see better.\n\nTinted glasses. Always trust a man with tinted glasses. We love you guys.\n\nWe love both of you and your baby. Thank you. Sophia.\n\nCongratulations. Thank you for stopping by. Thank you for having me on.\n\nBack to tan. Thank you. Los Angeles is the heart of Hollywood, but\n\nthe recent wildfires have deeply impacted this city. Matt Bomer is here to share how the community\n\nis coming together to rebuild. Thank you. Tan.\n\nI am here with Courtney Bailey, who oversees fundraising for Mptf, the Motion Picture and Television Fund, which is a wonderful\n\norganization close to my heart because they're committed to helping everyone in our industry in times of need.\n\nThe recent devastation caused by the LA wildfires demonstrates how critical Mptf is to members of our community who have lost\n\neverything and who are now trying to rebuild their livelihood.\n\nAnd it's not just actors, right, Courtney?

And if you are a member of our entertainment\n\ncommunity who needs our help, please just call our hotline at (323) 634-3888.\n\nHey, kids, can we talk fashion? I would love it. Oh my gosh, do we have a best dressed?\n\nOkay, I don't want to give any early predictions, but who do you like? No, I'm gonna say I loved Kim Kardashian.\n\nI was just about to say it, but I didn't want to be too obvious. She looked incredible.\n\nShe was giving cloud a ethereal. She was honestly giving bed vibes and I loved it.\n\nI also thought that her friend Steph Shep looked amazing. Steph.\n\nGorgeous. Gorgeous. Iconic.\n\nShe's always chic and as you would say, tan. Stunning. Stunning.\n\nAbsolutely stunning. You know who else was stunning? Who?\n\nI'm jealous that you got to speak to Nicole. Oh, well, she's just elegant in every way.\n\nSofia. Sofia. I was gonna say I got her name wrong.\n\nSofia. I was gonna roll with it. I was like, I was like, you are such a ride\n\nor die. You're such a ride. Thank you so much.\n\nI You guys, you guys have got to stop you. Are you looking at the monitor? Look at Jeff Goldblum.\n\nI mean, okay, shades on a red carpet for Jeff.\n\nLook how he's posing. Oh, I love him so much, guy. Okay, you guys, how's your first time going?\n\nThis is your first night hosting this. Are you doing okay? Holding up?\n\nThere's so much adrenaline. We took two beta blockers, and we are in it for the long haul.\n\nWe can't feel a thing right now. Beta blocker.\n\nWe wouldn't feel it. Has there been anyone that you were desperate to talk to that just passed you?\n\nThis is. Well, Serena Williams. Where is she?\n\nOh, don't get me started. She's agile. She got away.\n\nDid she? She's the fastest woman on the planet. So I think I missed her, but I heard people\n\nyelling, so I'm really upset. But I'm a tennis nerd. So that was I was.\n\nI'm obsessed with everything she does. We also we missed Julia Fox, which I'm livid about.\n\nShe did look incredible. I do love that you made a sport reference though, Hannah, as if I might know what\n\nyou're talking about, so I'm gonna have to move on real quick. Francesca's on the red carpet with Leslie and\n\nChelsea. I feel like I'm so excited. You've given me a microphone.\n\nIt's all over. Your job is going to be gone. I know.\n\nHonestly, if I could go. Okay.\n\nI'm so excited to have you guys join me. This is the lovely Chelsea Handler and Leslie Bibb.\n\nThank you. So if the two of you were to team up for a comedy show, what would it be about?\n\nOh, it would have to be some sort of road trip, right?\n\nThink Thelma and Louise. We're on a train. Like a high end train like the Orient Express\n\nor meets Midnight Run. Something like that. Yeah, I think it's Thelma and Louise meets\n\nMidnight Run. And we wouldn't have to do much acting. It would just be improvizational and just\n\nwith, like, loose, loose outlines.\n\nYes, absolutely. This would be exactly what's happening. Her talking and me laughing.\n\nThat's amazing, I love it. And Leslie, The White Lotus is all about secrets and scandals.\n\nSo if this party had a twist ending, what would it be? If this party had a surprise ending.\n\nYeah, we all die.\n\nI mean, that would be very White Lotus. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nBody. One body bag. Not one body bag.\n\nOne body bag. No one. You need Mike white.\n\nMike White I'm not a writer, but Mike white would tell you what's best. I love it.\n\nThank you both so, so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nOh, VA VA VA voom. Gabrielle Union looks absolutely stunning. Gosh, I love a column dress.\n\nAnd she looks gorgeous in that. Um, who do we have next? Who's this vision?\n\nUm, do you know that dress? Couldn't be hotter. Oh, my God, it's Cyd Sydney Sweeney.\n\nHi, baby girl. Oh, she looks absolutely beautiful when she not looked gorgeous.\n\nI've got to say, Julia Garner might be on my best dressed list for the night.\n\nI'm assuming it's Gucci because she is their brand ambassador and looks Heavenly yaskin.\n\nAnd that girl knows how to pose. Gosh that's good. Love that.\n\nI love that she's giving us texture. Christina Ricci ah, we call her Nina. Hi, Nina.\n\nUm, Christina's looking beautiful.\n\nOh, wow. Oh, and here we have Ben. Gorgeous.\n\nBen. Um, okay. Shall we get back to it?\n\nFrancesca's on the carpet with our darling Dan and Clea.\n\nLet's hit it.\n\nSo I am joined by Dan Levy and Clea Duvall. Thank you so much for being here and for talking, for having us.\n\nUm, Dan, you've mastered the art of fashion both on and off screen. How do you stay true to your personal style?\n\nI don't know, I always feel like when you try something on and you feel your best in it, that's generally what you should be going\n\nwith. But often people can put you in some pretty easy stuff.\n\nYeah. Do you think it's fashion, but if you can't wear it, there's no point.\n\nIt's all the confidence of it. So anyway, sometimes the simpler way to go is always the best.\n\nIt's true, it's true. And is there a genre or role that you've always wanted to explore that you haven't\n\nyet? Um, I mean, I'm fascinated for this answer.\n\nI the genre I'm most excited about is one that I've actually been in as an actor, but as a director, I'd really like to do horror.\n\nLove that. I would love to do horror. I love horror.\n\nI don't think anyone would take me seriously in a horror, really. I would put you in a horror movie.\n\nHorror? Yeah. Okay, great.\n\nOkay, done. Thank you. A horror film.\n\nOkay. All right, so who asked who to this event? Do you guys have, like, a kind of promposal\n\nthing? I said, Cleo, will you come to the Vanity Fair party with me in rose petals?\n\nYeah, in front of Cleo's House. I burst into tears. Into tears.\n\nWow. And I said, of course. The rest is history for us.\n\nReally? God. That's amazing.\n\nThat's so lovely. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nThank you for. Thank you for joining me. And I hope you have the best.\n\nThank you for having us.\n\nGosh, Mr. Stanfield, you have never looked more handsome. I love a Saint Laurent suit on a man.\n\nAnd I'm assuming this is his partner who is looking equally stunning. Wow.\n\nCould you imagine being a couple? That's hot. That is that hot?\n\nLike, where do you go from there? You wake up in the morning just knowing this is it.\n\nYou're perfect. Um, you guys, at some point soon, hopefully we're going to see Selena Gomez because she\n\njust rocked up and I see her in line and she's looking she's standing right behind us and we're trying to get out.\n\nI'm so jealous. I know I tried to pretend I was cool too. She looked incredible.\n\nI'm sweating just knowing she's near because I don't want her to know we're talking about her.\n\nNah. Do it. Do it.\n\nShe's wearing so many diamonds. I just burnt out my retina. And you know what?\n\nThe thing is? She's not. They're not on loan, I bet.\n\nLike she's Quincy. She can afford to keep those.\n\nYeah, those are hers. Those are just. Those are her.\n\nHer Saturday night diamonds. Not the regular. Like dishwashing diamonds.\n\nShe'll wear those in the kitchen, I'm sure. She's one of those guys. She also must be tired because she has been\n\non a press run. Do you know what? No.\n\nThat one's got so much energy. She's been doing this for years. She is trained.\n\nShe's a machine. True. I did watch her documentary.\n\nShe's been busy for a long time. Yeah. And she's not stopping anytime soon.\n\nOh, I love when men go for something fun. And they don't just do the traditional.\n\nIt's pirate chic. Pirate chic? Yeah.\n\nI love that you're calling it pirate chic. It is fully Saint Laurent. And you just referred to it as pirate chic.\n\nLOL. Saint Laurent loves a boat.\n\nSaint Laurent has been on a boat before. That's so funny. That's so funny.\n\nAll right. One of the best things about award season is getting to see a more candid, unfiltered side\n\nof Hollywood's biggest stars. Vanity Fair has been capturing such moments for some of our favorite nominees and winners\n\nall season long. They remain. They're still in the city.\n\nThe aspirations of the film really speak to me on many levels. One as an artist, as someone who wants to\n\nleave behind a body of work that is of some significance.\n\nEven distilling work in a film is similar to an architect erecting a building and creating something.\n\nThere's a foundation of work.\n\nSo joining me now is the host of this fabulous party, Vanity Fair editor in chief Radhika Jones.\n\nWelcome. Hi, Francesca. Hi.\n\nWhat is so special about tonight? Well, the Oscar party is always special. It is the end of a long season of hard work\n\nand campaigning on the part of the actors and directors and everyone who comes to the party.\n\nIt's it's such an incredible night of celebration, and it's literally the high point of many people's lives.\n\nIt's like the night that they win an Oscar, so that's great. But, you know, we're also conscious this year\n\nthat it's been a difficult start to the year for LA with the wildfires.\n\nWe are happy to be partnering with Baby to Baby and Mptf to provide help out with some wildfire relief for families and for industry\n\nprofessionals. So it feels good to be here to lift those causes up and also to celebrate some amazing\n\ntalent. That's amazing. And what does this party mean to you?\n\nI mean, well, I was thinking on the way over. This is my seventh Oscar party. Lucky seven.\n\nI know. So I think it's going to be a great night. And honestly, it's just so much fun and\n\neveryone comes in and has a wonderful time, so I'm looking forward to the same.\n\nAmazing. Thank you so much and enjoy. Thank you.\n\nAwesome. We are joined by Madison Beer, who I currently have beef with because we both have\n\nthe same good side. We're both going to talk to her like this. That's so crazy.\n\nBecause Hannah wouldn't let me stand on that side for my dress. It's a real fight.\n\nI actually need to stand like this, too. But the crazy thing is, Madison beer does not have a bad side.\n\nAnd you? You do? What are you talking about?\n\nNo. She does. No, I do.\n\nI really do. I do. She said no, you do.\n\nI Vanity Fair Vanity Fair almost fired me because of it.\n\nWait, you're you're singing. Career is blowing up. Your fashion has never been better.\n\nOh my God. What are the vibes right now? I don't know.\n\nAre you excited to be here and talking to us? Absolutely. I'm so honored that I'm here.\n\nThis is amazing. And I feel like you're so nice of you. Sorry.\n\nYou've done. No, she's really nice. She's not looking over here.\n\nSorry. I'm like. You're so nice.\n\nOh my God. I love you guys.\n\nShould we just go in and have a cocktail? I feel like we just want.\n\nOh, wait. So when you're at a party, who are you like? Are you the wallflower?\n\nAre you socializing? Are you just observing? No.\n\nI'm terrified. You're terrified the whole time. But I'm trying to be more confident just in\n\ngeneral. Even if it's, like, fake it till you make it, you know?\n\nYeah. This is how we got here. Trying really hard.\n\nYeah, we lied on our resume when we got here. It's just been fake it till you make it. Yeah.\n\nYeah, I think I'm just trying to be more confident, but internally, I'm like, who am I?\n\nWell, what's your trick when you're not feeling confident, what's your go to thing to do?\n\nPretend. Yeah, you have to pretend. And that's why you deserve an Oscar one day.\n\nIf there's someone that you look up to that you feel like always embodies, like, confidence and stuff, think about them.\n\nThat's what I do. Honestly, I'll think about someone that I'm like, I know this person is always eating.\n\nThey're always confident I love, and I just, like, honestly pretend that I'm them if I'm feeling insecure.\n\nOkay, we have to talk before you go. We have to talk about your dress. Yes.\n\nUB sass. Thank you. It's giving old Hollywood.\n\nI love the black and white. Yeah. No, she's a tall drink of water.\n\nShe's so gorgeous. And I love the high pony. Thank you.\n\nHow do you pick your hairstyle for, like, to match the dress? I never wear my hair up.\n\nEver. Neither do I. Are we twins?\n\nWe look the same. I hate my ears. We do look the same.\n\nWe're twins. Wait. Someone told me I had elf ears when I was\n\ngrowing up. Someone was like. You should get your ears pinned back.\n\nAnd it ruined my life. So here we are. That's so crazy.\n\nI love my ears. No, no, she loves. And you can hear me so well right now.\n\nYou know what I mean? No, absolutely I do. I can hear them across the street.\n\nNo, but nothing gets past you. I honestly just, like, I don't know, I just feel like I try to look at an outfit.\n\nI honestly did this fitting with my hair up, and I was like, I kind of like it, and I hate that I like it.\n\nSo hopefully I don't hate all the photos that come out. No, you crushed it.\n\nYou're absolutely. We look up to you. You killed all the time to think about you.\n\nWhen we want to be confident, when we get inside. Yes.\n\nWe love you. Back to him.\n\nI'm thinking. No thank you. Thank you for doing this.\n\nYou okay? I don't get this. I could.\n\nI'm sorry. You caught me gossiping. I know we were.\n\nWe were gossiping. Emma's my girl, I love you. You know I love you so much.\n\nSo much. This is all the conversation is gonna be. I love you so much.\n\nWe're just gonna gush, but I'm gonna be professional and say this. Okay.\n\nYou look incredible. Thank you so much. Now, I do need you to know.\n\nI knew as soon as she walked off, I was like Jean-Paul Gaultier, right? Yeah.\n\nObviously, it's Jean-Paul Gaultier. Bye, Ludovic. Unbelievable.\n\nI, like, saw this collection, and I was like, if I don't wear that, I'm gonna be sad. I'm gonna be heartbroken with the hat.\n\nLike, it's all so tough, baby. Thank you. It's so tough.\n\nIt's the best you've ever looked. Wait. Stop!\n\nIs it? Thank you. I know she always looks good.\n\nAnd I need you to know I said it off camera, too. And if I don't like someone's.\n\nLook, I don't say it. I love that about you. I'll find a way to come up with something\n\nelse. I love that. It's the best you've ever looked.\n\nI love the short on you. And it's not easy to pull off for most people.\n\nThank you for giving me 80s. I love that. Well, I just like to be honest.\n\nThe reason why I did it and the reason why I chopped it all off was because, honestly. Well, I wanted a change.\n\nI was kind of sick of, like, long hair. I've had it my whole life. But also, it's so much easier to have short\n\nhair. I wake up. Sure is.\n\nAnd my hair is just done. I love that we are almost twinning.\n\nI'm going to go. I'm going to go for your blond soon, I'm sure.\n\nLet's do it I would love I would love so much. Good.\n\nOkay. We were talking about this before you guys joined us.\n\nChamberlain. Coffee? Yes.\n\nYou launched a store? Yes. Wait.\n\nWhat are we calling it? A cafe. Cafe?\n\nA cafe? A cafe that went nuts. It's been truly like an incredible\n\nblessing. Is this the first of many? It's the first of many, hopefully.\n\nBut I always am like. Oh, God. Now, did I jinx it or something?\n\nBut I would love to give me an exclusive. Where's the next one? Opening?\n\nI actually don't know. You know, I would give you the exclusive, but.\n\nAll right, all right. But we're, like, almost house hunting. Do you know what I mean?\n\nIt's like. Which is so fun. Yeah, we're shopping for the next place, but\n\nit's like you want the aura of the space to be, right? And that takes time.\n\nI'm telling you, this one's going to rule the world one day. She's the baddest around, all right?\n\nRight. If you don't rule the world first, I can't gush anymore.\n\nYou got to go. She's gonna go to the party. I'm gonna see you in the party.\n\nI love you. I love you. I love this girl.\n\nI love you. That's it, that's it. We're out.\n\nI'm going home. I'll see you all later. No.\n\nI'm joking. Well, come join us. Come join us.\n\nLook at this switcheroo. Don't worry about it. Hello, Alan.\n\nHow are you, sir? Good to see you. Very well.\n\nThanks. You're so dapper. You look so dapper.\n\nSo I met you at a party earlier on this year or last year with Corinna.\n\nUm. And you were wearing a gorgeous white suit. And I asked her was that man styled himself\n\nbecause he looks incredible. And you do stuff that most people don't do. Can you tell me about how you get ready for\n\nan event. Do you work with a status or do you just tell yourself?\n\nNo, I work with the stylist Erica Cloud, but do you push that stylist to push you harder because you don't dress like most men?\n\nI do push her to like. I push her to push me. Do you?\n\nYou care about fashion? I do care about fashion. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nIt's very much a, like a, like a big part of my life. And I have, like, whenever the cameras\n\nweren't rolling. Yeah. You know, and, um, living in Los Angeles and\n\nnow living in New York, you know, the style is the is the same, but it's different. It sure is.\n\nAnd. Yeah. Yeah, I think the I, you know, I've never\n\nworn sweatpants on a plane, I'll say that. You haven't? Gosh, I live in sweatpants on a plane.\n\nAbsolutely not. I think it's crazy when people get dressed up for a plane.\n\nOkay, wait. I think it's crazy that people get dressed up for a plane.\n\nAbsolutely crazy. I think it's so insane. I just wanna be comfortable.\n\nOkay, enough about fashion. Because I really want to talk about White Lotus.\n\nAnd I know I don't have you for long, right? Um, the the new season of White Lotus has gone nuts, like everyone is talking about it.\n\nDo you do you feel pressure going into White Lotus because it's such a massive show? Yeah.\n\nI mean, I think anybody would be lying if they didn't. If they didn't say that.\n\nYeah. You feel pressured. You don't want to disappoint Mike white first\n\nand foremost. And you don't want to disappoint the fans. Yeah.\n\nAnd you don't want to disappoint the people that you're working with. Right.\n\nYeah. But all of those concerns, like coming to your mind, even, like working with Quentin,\n\nyou know, like Tarantino a couple of times. You always have that kind of going into an experience.\n\nYeah. And then, you know, pretty quickly thereafter, you realize, oh, wait a minute,\n\nI'm a storyteller. That's what I do for a living. I'm going to tell this story as best I can.\n\nNot just the best you can. You're killing it. I'm loving.\n\nI'm such a massive fan. I'm loving the new season. Thank you so much.\n\nAnd you're so damn good on it. Thank you, I think. Terrifying.\n\nA complete A-hole. But I know that you're a lovely man in real life now.\n\nI promise. I promise you that. That by the end of it, we'll fall in love\n\nwith you when it's all said and done. This guy, Rick Hatchet, and the journey that he's on will say something very profound.\n\nAnd it will be visceral in ways that you could not expect. We love a tease that doesn't really give too\n\nmuch away. I'll take that for now. Thank you so much.\n\nWe'll see you in the party. Have fun tonight. Thank you mate.\n\nCheers, buddy. Cheers, buddy. And then we're going to swap.\n\nWe're gonna do a switcheroo again. Look at all these pictures. Thank you so much, mate.\n\nHello, my darling. How are you? Okay, everyone.\n\nCheryl, look at this vision. Um. We did it.\n\nI think I did this with you last year, and I was gagged. I was left gagged, and we had a lovely time.\n\nWell, because you're an angel sent down from heaven. Thank you very much.\n\nYou know, you have the best reputation in Hollywood. Thank you.\n\nUm, can you talk to me about what goes into planning for tonight? Because this is stunning.\n\nThank you. This is Valdrin Sahiti, and my stylist does such an excellent job.\n\nAnd, you know, I think about where we started three years ago to where we have arrived now. Classic simplicity.\n\nTimeless. I am so thankful. I'm so thankful.\n\nShe's so talented. And you look back in 20 years and say, yeah, I looked incredible.\n\nIt's timeless. Um, I wanted to ask you this for a long time. Yes.\n\nNow, when you get up on stage and you say something, it's always profound. As if I've gone to the most incredible\n\nchurch. Do you plan it in advance or. You just are so beautifully philosophical.\n\nAlways. You know something? I'm going to have to take the compliment and\n\nsay that that's just a part of my makeup. It's just a part of who I am as a human being.\n\nI truly, truly believe life is short, and if people don't acknowledge how short it is by spending their days, by being as good as they\n\ncan, as kind as they can, they are wasting their time on this earth.\n\nI could not agree more, and I don't want to take up any more of your time. So go enjoy that party because it's a good\n\none tonight. It's a real good one. The gorgeous Cheryl upstate.\n\nI've got nothing else to say. What's up man? We got Brooklyn, Queens, Albany in the\n\nbuilding. We're actually starting some kind of some kind of band or cult.\n\nJesse, congratulations. You've been on a crazy press tour. Yeah.\n\nYeah, yeah. And, like, you've been killing it with Kieran.\n\nOh, thanks. How do you hype yourself up before an interview?\n\nEspecially if you have social anxiety like this one. Yeah.\n\nWe're nervous. If you've heard or seen me in any interviews, I don't hype myself up at all.\n\nI'm very, very low. Low wattage? Yeah.\n\nUnderpromise and overdeliver. That's it. Yeah, exactly.\n\nI'm obsessed with that. Yeah. Have you, like.\n\nDo you like this party? Like, what are you, like, at a party? Like, is this one that you're like, oh, I'm\n\ngoing to dance. Well, I am like, at a party is somebody who's doing a favor for my wife.\n\nYou're a good husband. Oh, it's like. Like your wife took you shopping and you're\n\nsitting and waiting for her. That's like the energy. Pretty much that.\n\nYes, it's pretty much that. And then she often will walk out with a bag. Yes.\n\nYeah, it's pretty much the same thing. I like that a lot. What a date night.\n\nThe Vanity Fair. Yeah. This should net me several things that I\n\ndon't have to go to in the next six months. Has anyone come up to you for a selfie? Who's really famous?\n\nOh, no. I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that.\n\nNot one person. I couldn't compute your question of like, wait, why?\n\nI don't understand. Oh, have they asked me for a weight? You mean because.\n\nOh, because you're awesome. Jessie. Yeah.\n\nNo no no, no, but I'm not. I think they could tell that I'm not the selfie.\n\nYou're not the kind of guy. Yeah, I think so. I think I give off energy of you'll ruin the\n\nselfie. Something fun. And we had our phones.\n\nWe would take a selfie with you. Then I would. Then you would be my answer.\n\nYeah, yeah, that makes that makes sense. And when you're coming together with a look, do you have opinions with your stylist?\n\nAre you like, this is the vibe I want to put out tonight or does your wife pick your outfits?\n\nUm, sorry. We're hearing a lot of questions.\n\nListen. I'm prepared. No, I they put this on me five minutes before\n\nI left. Yeah. And then, you know, I could take it off and\n\nnever have to wear it until somebody gets married or bar mitzvah in my family for the next several years.\n\nYeah. Do you ever complain about your feet like that?\n\nYour shoes hurt? No. I complain about my feet for other reasons.\n\nOh, okay. Yeah, it's kind of more of a bunion issue. Maybe we'll get into that a little later.\n\nThanks. We'll discuss our bunions more in depth. Vanity Fair is telling us we can't discuss\n\nbunions. That's actually the one thing we weren't allowed to talk about tonight.\n\nAre you working on any new projects? How do you find inspiration for a new project?\n\nLook at me. Just asking the deepest question I could think of.\n\nYou know, we're on this purpose on this planet, Jesse. Listen, we all float around for it feels like\n\na second. Um, look, we're just feathers tonight. Makes it feel like gone with the wind.\n\nYes, yes, it's been amazing. Yeah, it's been amazing. And I think people are ready for this\n\ninterview. I think people are going to. I think just with everything that's going on\n\nin the world, I think people are going to be ready for this interview. I know that it's going to change the climate\n\nin some capacity. Yeah. If anything, Hannah's wearing extensions.\n\nI wear extensions really important. Yeah. Do you know what extensions are?\n\nOf course I know what extensions are. Where? Where I can't even get in a fight.\n\nJesse. I was just asking if you knew. I do, and they are seamless.\n\nThank you. Thank you so much. Would you ever bleach your hair blond.\n\nUh, yeah. Yeah, I definitely do that. Yeah, yeah.\n\nYeah, definitely. Just like on a movie part, I wouldn't like you wouldn't do it like on a Saturday.\n\nWell, even if you're going through a hard time, you might do it on a Saturday because, you know, usually shooting on Monday.\n\nRight? Okay. So you want to do all the hair dyeing on the\n\nweekend. You're smart with logistics okay. Honestly, he's handled everything we've\n\nthrown at him. And we are so impressed by you. Oh.\n\nThanks, Jesse. You're killing it. Go have fun at the party.\n\nYou've survived. Get away from us! You're so funny.\n\nYou survived. We love you. This was a nice back to you, tan.\n\nThat was great. You guys are great. Oh my God.\n\nJesse, um. Oh, my God, is that Cynthia? Please tell me that.\n\nCynthia. I see the nails. It's got to be Cynthia.\n\nOh, Lina. Love this couple so much. Wow, I love that.\n\nUm, Cynthia's giving us a third look of the night. Well done.\n\nCynthia. Sofia Carson, who said she watched my Netflix specials?\n\nSo obsessed. I love her. We ride at dawn.\n\nLook at this moment. A vision, a vision. You guys.\n\nYou guys look beautiful. How did you decide? Hair up or hair down?\n\nYeah, the hair up was easy because there was a lot. See?\n\nWe're all friends. Sorry. That's Hannah's best friend.\n\nHailey Bieber. We just said hi. Hayley, I'm right here.\n\nThat was crazy. Really cool. No!\n\nStop! It's because she's wearing extensions. I know, she's been acting different.\n\nI Halle Bailey it's the hair. It's the long hair. That's why I asked you.\n\nHair up. There was a lot happening here, so it was an easy decision to take it out.\n\nHave you ever done anything crazy to prep for an event like this? No, I'm pretty boring.\n\nI actually had my first shot of tequila before a carpet. Ever.\n\nJust now. Oh my God. Just now.\n\nHow do you feel? I feel great. Okay, good, good.\n\nNo we're not. It's nice. It's like takes the edge off.\n\nWe're sober. If anyone's wondering, this is us sober. Oh my gosh.\n\nSo when you go to these events, do you have any advice for talking to super famous people?\n\nBecause we've not been doing a great job thus far. What have you guys been doing in your\n\napproach? I just we've just been asking silly questions.\n\nThat's nice though. Yeah. Who are you at a party?\n\nAre you a wallflower? Are you not? I like that.\n\nWe're asking her questions that we asked. We're asking her if our questions were good to other people.\n\nNo. You feel like a girl's girl. And so I feel comfortable.\n\nWe do feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. We do feel comfortable with your energy.\n\nUm, but, yeah, when you go into a party, do you have any advice for, like, looking cool? No, because I'm not cool.\n\nI've never been cool. I was a nerd in school, and I still am, so I just, like, approach them like a fan.\n\nBut I try to be, like, subtle about it. And I still say, like, I just admire you so much and I never know if it's the party to do\n\nit, but everyone seems to take it well. Now I have to ask, did you practice posing in your dress?\n\nYou did practice. What did you come up with? I show you.\n\nYes, yes. Show us please. Okay, so we're fluffing.\n\nWe're fluffing. Keep it down. Yes!\n\nIt's gorgeous. It's like a goddess. This is.\n\nTake note of this. This is important. Right on the hip bone.\n\nRight on the hip bone. It's giving angles. Yes, yes.\n\nOh, my. I'm blind. I'm blind.\n\nThis is crazy. Oh, sorry. Took your mic.\n\nYeah. What's your, like, day to day outfit when you're at home?\n\nThe closest thing to pajamas. Yes. Pajamas.\n\nThe closest thing like to comfy sweats. Oversize everything all the time. Girlhood is about balance.\n\nIt really is. Am I right? When you're right.\n\nWhen you're choosing an outfit. Do you ever choose for comfort? Or do you always go for style?\n\nI've ever chosen for comfort. So to be honest, I will say though, today I was between this dress and another dress that\n\nwas a little out of my comfort zone and this one felt the most me.\n\nYeah. So if that's comfort, then maybe this was the dress, but it's not.\n\nParticularly if you look good, you play good. Exactly. No, it's so true.\n\nIt's about how you feel. Yeah. Yeah, it really is.\n\nSofia, thank you so much for coming. We too nice to us. Such a pleasure.\n\nAnd. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nGet out of here. Get out of here! Go hang out with someone.\n\nCool. Oh my God! Yes, yes.\n\nUm, okay. I don't even know what to say right now, but my best friend is here.\n\nWe're freaking out. Haley bleeping Bieber is Haley.\n\nHow are you? Hi. Nice to meet you.\n\nIt's so nice to meet you. My best friend talks about you all the time. She said my best friend too.\n\nNo, Haley. It's it's. Where's Kendall?\n\nBecause I feel like she's coming. She's coming because that's my best friend you're trying to have, like.\n\nYeah, like a Charlie's Angels moment. You always say crush it on the red carpet. Like, truly, always the queen.\n\nThank you. When you're, like, in the fitting for your dress, for something like this.\n\nDo you know, in the first 30s or are you, like, someone that has to try it on, put it back on, take a picture.\n\nKind of more that because once I try something on, I start conceptualizing the whole thing.\n\nThe hair, the makeup, the whole. You give her a persona? The whole thing head to toe.\n\nBut tonight, I actually was really torn between two dresses. But I went with this one.\n\nIt's custom YSL gorgeous. I love it, I'm super happy.\n\nAnd your skin looks so good. Exactly. That's what I want to know.\n\nWhat road are we wearing right now? Um, well, all my skin prep is always road. And then I also have some of our blush on our\n\npeptide lip shape, a lip treatment. Call it out. Hale's.\n\nCall it out. My mom stole one of my lip treatments. So, mom, we'll discuss this later.\n\nIt's okay. I'll replace it for you. Thank you.\n\nI do, I'm like. Mom, I know someone. I'm good.\n\nSo, Hailey, you go to these parties a lot. Are you ever trying besides me? Are you trying to make any new friends in\n\nthere, or is it kind of. You stick with the group. I'm.\n\nI like to stick with my friends, but I am a social butterfly. I start to kind of just, like, run around and\n\nfly around and talk to people. She literally has an aura around her where you just want to befriend her.\n\nI can feel it. She can literally, literally the best. That's how I feel about you.\n\nAnd now you. Haley. We're the three best friends.\n\nHello. We want to know any posing advice. Because you every carpet you just like.\n\nYou look like you're seven feet tall. I always still get nervous about the way to pose, because, you know, I obviously wanted\n\nto look. Well, they're screaming at you, and it's very overwhelming.\n\nI need a beta blocker. It's very overwhelming. You feel like you're about to get robbed?\n\nYeah. It's crazy. Also, as a mother.\n\nNow on the red carpet. How has it changed your perspective on all these crazy events?\n\nLike having something to ground you? Well, you're just thinking about such different things now.\n\nI'm like, I'm going to go inside and be checking my, my, my baby monitor nonstop. So I have a different mindset.\n\nI have a furbo, so I know I check on my cat. She's a mother. She's a she's a mother.\n\nI'm a mother. To actually Haley as a trendsetter, any trends for that are coming up that you're\n\ninto in terms of fashion because we're just or any trends that you're like, I'm so over it.\n\nYou know, what's so annoying is I just answered that, like, I thought about this the other day and I'm like, people ask me this\n\nquestion a lot. I have to remember my answer and now I forget.\n\nI forget. I'm so annoying. You could literally punch us in the face and\n\nwe don't care. Like you don't have to say anything right now.\n\nYou are incredible. Keeping you. We're obsessed with you.\n\nI'm so happy to see you. Thank you for talking to us.\n\nI'll see you tomorrow for brunch. Get out of here. Get out of here.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Lil NAS x, are you kidding me?\n\nOh my God. Guys. We're just.\n\nYay!

I love a cropped blazer, honey. Yes!\n\nOh my God. And the shoe. And the shoes.\n\nCan you, like, lift your leg up? Because I feel like the people at home.\n\nThis is very in right now. I heard, I heard we, Mr. X, I have questions for you.\n\nWhen do you decide to go tiktoking or when do you stop? Because I feel like you.\n\nDo I stop? You know, you go, you disappear for like ten years.\n\nYou come back. Stop it. Right.\n\nHow do you decide? I randomly do it. I like to do it when I like.\n\nHave fun. I don't like to do it, like. Feel like it's an obligation.\n\nYeah. No, I don't like obligated TikTok. Like we.\n\nI wait for this content. I drool for your content, I can't wait. Um, okay.\n\nHow involved are you with putting together looks? Because they're always.\n\nSo you. Yeah. I'm, um.\n\nI'm pretty involved. I never get, like, too crazy. I don't like to step on, like, the stylish\n\ntoes. Yeah. You're not like, yelling.\n\nThey had this. They had this in black. And I was like, okay, can we get it white?\n\nI want to feel godly. Yeah. Can we get, like, on the arm, like my stencil\n\nfor my my next album. Yeah. Like dream boy.\n\nLike I'm getting it on. Yeah. Always be promoting.\n\nPeople don't talk about he lived.

I need to know, like when you go into a party like this, do you just stunt on everyone\n\nbecause you're a better dancer? Like, are you like, hey, watch this. No, I'm like trying to dance with everybody.\n\nI want to make everybody who looks like they're uncomfortable feel like I'm like. I'm like, yay!\n\nSee if I could dance like you. I'd be like, form a circle around me. I'm going to do something here, you know?\n\nWait, are you guys going to make out? Are you guys going to make out? We're going to do it.\n\nNo, no, not this time. We're streaming so we could. It's not on real time.\n\nNo, no. I'm scared. And also look, his nails look good too.\n\nOh, yes. Oh, yeah. They just came.\n\nThey just came like this. I didn't touch them little things. I used to play your songs all the time to\n\nprep for my stand up. You need to get back to doing it, baby. No, no.\n\nLike when when you're first song came out, you guys aren't going to make out okay. Now he's mad.\n\nNow I'm in a fight. I'm mad. It's okay.\n\nJust scream the next one, okay? I was like, what kind of sexual dungeon are you in right now?\n\nAnd I was like, Lil NAS X. Like, I'm just playing him having fun. No, we are obsessed with you.\n\nYeah. Has anyone, um, like, cool asked you for a selfie?\n\nI'd like to hear tonight. No, because I just got here and I wasn't at the Oscars.\n\nSadly. That's okay. Neither were we.\n\nThis is where the party is. That's cool. Yeah, that was cool.\n\nWhen are you gonna act? When am I going to act? Yeah.\n\nI've had so many opportunities. I keep getting scared. I'm going to do it next time, though.\n\nYeah, do it next time. Getting scared next time. Rooting you on.\n\nYeah. You got it. Euphoria season 18 I'm on you.\n\nImagine if you've been scared in the past. You wouldn't have been where you are today. Okay, I'm not going to.\n\nUm, Mel Robbins, you right now. Let's get back to tan. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you guys so much. Thank you so much. Hi, Lil NAS x.\n\nGosh, that man's handsome. Um. Wow.\n\nGorgeous. Everyone, check out Cynthia. She's always got a look.\n\nShe's one of the best dressed on every red carpet, if not the best.\n\nUm, and this is her third look of the night. She wore two looks at the Oscars, and now she's giving us this drama.\n\nLook at that pose, too. Magical. Magical.\n\nOkay, so we've compared, uh, last year's locks or her past Vanity Fair locks.\n\nIf you see the side of the screen on the right, you'll see what she's worn in the past and she's worn Louis Vuitton in 2024.\n\nIn 2022. Actually, this is the Louis Vuitton look that she wore in 2022.\n\nUm, and the one you just saw was the. Wow. I'm going to repeat that for you.\n\nThis one here is from 2022. And the one with the red backdrop is from 2024 that we saw last year.\n\nAnd she looked gorgeous. Um, and I'm going to throw back to the girls who are with.\n\nLet's see. I can't see I can't see who she's with. Let's see.\n\nShe's with Rachel outside. I will never forget you should. Girls here with Rachel.\n\nWe're literally forgot we were what we were doing as a job. We are here with Rachel Sennott, who's\n\neverywhere right now and is currently going viral for admitting that she's on beta blockers.\n\nAnd, you know, we're on beta blockers. We're strong believers in it. Yeah I didn't.\n\nAre people reacting like it's a big deal? I actually I don't look at the comments. I'm not allowed to.\n\nBut me neither. I think it's a chill, natural thing. Better than heroin.\n\nNatural thing. It truly is. Let me just say it's not something where you\n\nfeel like good, but you just don't feel bad. That's what it is. You don't feel I'm.\n\nI'm literally numb from the neck down. But you know, what I appreciate is we have so much pressure all the time, and people like\n\nto be like, oh, I'm just being me. No, you're like, it gets nerve wracking. And sometimes I pop a pill.\n\nYou can't just raw dog life. That's crazy. No, I'm not being me.\n\nI don't know who this is, but I'm being someone.\n\nI'm obsessed with this dress. You and your stylist, Jared Ellner, are crushing it.\n\nWhat do you tell him before an event to pull off these outfits? Do you have, like, a specific vibe where\n\nyou're like, this is what I want to give tonight? Yeah.\n\nSo, okay. Jared is a genius. Yeah, I would say I want to like Jared, and I\n\nwill mood board. Like, sometimes he'll come over to my house, and then we'll just pull a bunch of photos.\n\nLike, let's just Pinterest a quesadilla. Yeah. But I will say Jared has the vision.\n\nLike he always I'm like, you're amused. He shows me something, and sometimes I'll be like, I don't know.\n\nAnd then I put it on and I'm like, you're a genius. Also, Rachel is hysterical, but also, like,\n\niconically beautiful. You're known for your pout. Can you teach us how to do your iconic pout?\n\nLet's do it in the camera. Like, how do we pull it off? I would say so what?\n\nWhat side of your face do you like better? This. We've been over this.\n\nNo, we've been fighting about it. Okay, so do your favorite side of the face. Okay.\n\nChin down. A little kind of dead eyes. Dead.\n\nAnd then. Sorry, I can't talk because I'm doing it, so.\n\nOh, I feel like I feel like we got the energy of it, though.\n\nBlow out of the lips. I think we got it. I'm obsessed.\n\nAlso, as a comic, you're chatty. You're a yapper. So am I.\n\nTotally. Are you yapping to people in there, or are you playing it cool to everyone?\n\nAre you kidding me? I can't not yeah, yeah. I mean, if you're not yapping, you're not\n\nyapping. Are you alive? You're not living, you know.\n\nRachel Sennott, get out there. We love you. We can't wait to watch your new show coming\n\nout. I'm so excited. Thank you.\n\nThank you, guys for coming. Back to you. Thank you for shopping with us.\n\nAnd we have all been heartbroken by the devastating fires that have ravaged Los Angeles.\n\nFrancesca is with one local organization aiding in the recovery.\n\nI'm here with Nora and Kelly from the incredible organization Baby to Baby. We all know that the Oscars celebrate the\n\nbest performances. What is the best act of kindness that you've witnessed recently?\n\nWell, baby to baby. We've had so many people coming to volunteer to help the cause, coming to donate supplies,\n\nbut also providing, you know, funds and emergency essentials to baby to baby and the families and children we serve.\n\nPeople have been coming in to volunteer just in droves from across the country and here in LA, but also people who even lost their own\n\nhomes have been showing up for us to support the families affected by the Eaton and Palisades Fire.\n\nSo it's been really incredible to see. That's amazing. That's beautiful.\n\nVanity Fair is thrilled to be partnering with Baby to Baby this year, and you've all done so much for children and families here in LA.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about your work so far?\n\nAbsolutely. We're so grateful to Vanity Fair for the resources for coming in and rolling up their\n\nsleeves. And helping baby to Baby provides emergency essentials to children and babies in\n\nparticular. And so already in the last eight weeks, we've distributed 12 million items, including\n\ndiapers, wipes, hygiene products, blankets, strollers, cribs, clothing and those are going to children and families and babies\n\nimpacted by both the Eaton and Palisades fires.\n\nWow. That's amazing. And now that the LA community is turning\n\ntoward rebuilding, What plans does baby to baby have for the future?\n\nWell, we know from our disaster response because we've been doing it for over ten years that families really need help for\n\nmonths and years to come. It's not just these eight weeks, I mean, and immediately, obviously, we were able to\n\ndistribute these emergency supplies to children and families.\n\nBut this will continue and our work will continue for a long time to come. It's a long road ahead for families,\n\nespecially who've lost their homes, their jobs, their livelihoods. So baby to baby will be here.\n\nAnd we can't thank Vanity Fair enough for the incredible support they've given.\n\nThank you Francesca. We are with the one and only Jeremy Pope. This is what my husband wants to do to me\n\nwhen I get too chatty. That's. You look incredible.\n\nWhat is the story of that? What is the story tonight? I'm feeling inspired.\n\nI'm feeling creative. I'm in my Dune era. We're celebrating Dune.\n\nNo, it's. It was a fun look that I love. It's Egan lab.\n\nI pulled it to myself, you are wearing like, are these heels or platforms like a Rick Owens?\n\nCan I, can I lift a little? Okay. Yeah.\n\nNow are they comfy? Are they are a big old chunky platform okay.\n\nAnd if you get tired in the party, you can just literally wrap that around your head. And if you don't want to talk to people, just\n\ncover it up. Wait. I love a man wearing at least some platforms\n\nbecause we're this close to tearing an ACL at all times, and Men Don't Understand has never been the same.\n\nNo, if Prince can do it, then we should all be able to do it. I love Prince, he was a big inspiration in\n\nthis look tonight. Yes. Oh my God.\n\nUm, also, do you get annoyed with people saying your eyes are beautiful?\n\nI appreciate it, that wasn't a compliment. No, you were just saying that was a statement.\n\nJust a statement. I am very grateful. No, JP, we love you.\n\nThank you for coming and getting that party. You're awesome. So much fun.\n\nAh, JP, which does sound like a lacrosse player. JP I did, um, tan back to you.\n\nGood one. Hannah, thank you so much. I am now joined by Conan and his lovely wife,\n\nLiza. Hi, guys. It's a big night for you.\n\nYeah, it was a lot of fun. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, it was really fun.\n\nOkay. Was it fun going in, or is it fun now that it's over?\n\nUh, it was fun when you get to hit the stage. Okay. And then before.\n\nThat is a lot of worrying and work. Okay. A lot of worrying and work.\n\nAnd Liza was very patient. Well, the funny thing is, last couple of months, because I've been a little bit of a\n\nmental case, but once you get on the stage and you're ready, it's fun.\n\nConan, um, I know that this is about you right now, but I need your wife's opinion.\n\nCan you tell me the real, real. What's he like preparing for something like this?\n\nIs he wildly frustrating at home? Not frustrating, not frustrating, not frustrating.\n\nJust very. I have my moments. Does he does he hard working and focused?\n\nAre you his sounding board? Not alone. There are many people who make up the sound.\n\nShe's not the only sounding, but I try a lot of material out on on Liza. But are you honest?\n\nIf you're not feeling something he's going to include. Oh, God.\n\nYeah. No, we had a joke, which I won't repeat, but are you sure you can?\n\nIt's a safe space here. No, no, no, I don't trust you. I don't trust any of you.\n\nUh, but, um, Liza was like, nah, I don't think that's the right way to go. And she was right, and she was right.\n\nAnd it was a joke that the writers really liked. But we got I got rid of it because you\n\nweren't feeling it, and I'm really glad I did. Every writer's favorite way.\n\nNow tell me when you watch him, when he starts to present. Sorry.\n\nWhen he starts to host the Oscars, are you sat there thinking, come on, you can do it. You can do it.\n\nLike, are you a proud, never nervous. Wow. Not at all.\n\nWow. I have faith in him above pretty much anything else.\n\nWill you marry me? Absolutely. I'm a very homosexual man, but very welcoming\n\nin this relationship. It could be a throuple I would love. I've always wanted to be a throuple.\n\nAnd I love my husband. He's great, but he's okay in my life. He's all right.\n\nHe lives for my life. I want to just talk about your hair before we kiss you off.\n\nYeah. Your hair's not as high as it typically is. And I need you to know that I had very high\n\nhair. Also, you know it. It's the weather.\n\nOkay. And my hair is barometric. My hair is barometric.\n\nSo when the hair. When it's humid, when it's just right, it fluffs up, and then it can fall down\n\nsometimes. Conan, you. I don't know if you know, but I had a version\n\nof your hair, so I'm on a Netflix show, and people used to compare me to you constantly. I was the Brown Conan.\n\nYes. And then only a few months ago, I changed it. My question before you leave is, would you\n\never go for something a little different other than the quiff? I think it's too late.\n\nI did it. I went with this a long time ago, and there's nothing we can do.\n\nAll right, all right. Well, on that, we'll let you go. Thank you so much for a lovely evening.\n\nCongratulations for tonight. That's amazing. And thanks for having us.\n\nLovely to meet you. Thank you so much. Thank you everyone.\n\nNow we're going back to Hannah and Bedhead.\n\nThe best of me. I am newly in the Redhead Club. Yes.\n\nWelcome, welcome. Hi. It's nice here.\n\nI do have to say, I watched your documentary on Amazon Prime.\n\nI was so inspired. After that, I wanted I could take over the world.\n\nI'm so sorry. What was your inspiration behind this? Yeah, I just really wanted to give.\n\nLike, she's baring it all at Vanity Fair. Eco friendly. You're crushing.\n\nShe's definitely giving poison ivy. Yes, yes, yes. Green is crushing it.\n\nAnd I love a feather I freakin love. Look at that. The body is body.\n\nNo. It's body. Oh, my God, I'm obsessed.\n\nSo when you go in this party, are you dancing or are you just holding it tight? Posing.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you. I'm standing still. I'm giving statue.\n\nI'm giving Oscar. I feel like they have to pay to, like, see you perform.\n\nI told you that was a different live stream. Yeah, yeah. Don't.\n\nDon't do that for free. That's crazy. I do it for the hotties everywhere, though.\n\nYeah, yeah. No, you do it for the girls. And we appreciate that.\n\nYeah. You give so much confidence to women everywhere.\n\nWhat do you do when you're not feeling confident? I start my day with you and only you.\n\nOh my God. I'm gonna cry. Don't cry.\n\nWe're lying. No I know. No.\n\nYour music has literally, like, made me want. When I want to fight someone. I listen to your music.\n\nYou want to throw that fighting out the window, and you want to get cute and be a bad.\n\nWhen people are talking, I go turn on Megan. Body ody ody. I look beautiful.\n\nI look so great. Wait. No.\n\nYou look so good when you're. But I know because I watched your documentary.\n\nYou've been through so many dark things. How do you get yourself up and inspire people?\n\nI've never seen her this passionate. I just look in the mirror and I'll be like, damn you, that girl.\n\nYeah, right. Yeah, you are that girl. So go outside and act like you're that girl.\n\nNo, we love you. That's how I tackle my day. That I'm crying would be the one that made me\n\ncry. I'll take my pictures. Don't cry.\n\nCry. Do you cry a lot? I do cry.\n\nI'm a crier, I love that. What's your sign? I'm an Aquarius.\n\nOh, I don't cry much when I cry for a reason. Yes, you let it go. Well, keep, keep like letting it all into\n\nyour music. Never, never, never stop. I want to know.\n\nThat was so good. Come on girl. No.\n\nI know we've been staring yourself all the time. Meg, what are you wearing, though?\n\nWhen you're, like, just writing new music. What are you wearing? Big t shirt and panties.\n\nA big t shirt. Like, with stains on it and stuff. No.\n\nNo stains. Oh, sorry. That was me.\n\nLike the perfect big getting ready t shirt. No, just a plain white t shirt. Yeah, or like a graphic T or something.\n\nOne of my favorite celebrities on it or something. Okay.\n\nMy panties. Yeah, yeah, you are, as you should. Your thong.\n\nGranny thong. Always okay. Cheeks always out.\n\nCheeks out. Um, Meg, go in there. You've spent way too much time with us.\n\nWe love you so much. Somebody said they stole my place in line, I gotta go.\n\nOh, oh, oh, I think we should end every stream with cheeks. I'm joined by John Mulaney and Olivia Munn.\n\nWelcome. Thank you for being here. You've been part of iconic SNL moments.\n\nHow did it feel to be back for the 50th anniversary special? Are there any behind the scenes memories that\n\nyou're still laughing about? Um, there was a great pep talk in the cue card department before we started the three\n\nhour show, where they had stacks of cue cards about as high as me and Wally.\n\nThe cue card guy told everyone to just have fun. And everyone laughed because no one was\n\nreally going to have fun until the show was over. The show is over.\n\nYeah. That's great. And John, your Netflix talk show is coming\n\nback in a few weeks. If you could have any guest on the show, living or dead, who would be your dream to\n\ninterview and why? Oh, that's a good question. David Bowie would be my dream guest.\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah, that's a really good one. Yeah, yeah.\n\nAnd between the two of you, who's more likely to end up leading the charge to the dance floor tonight.\n\nIt would be me. 100%. But everyone knows that on site.\n\nI love that. Thank you both so much. Have an amazing night.\n\nHave a great night. Nice to see you. Nice to see you.\n\nOh my goodness. We're live. We are live with the one and only Nate\n\nBargatze, who's changing the world for comedy right now.\n\nThey don't let most comedians in, especially stand ups, because most of us are dirty. Yeah.\n\nHow did you get into this event? You know, I got I got invited this year, I got invited, I feel I still have it.\n\nSo I feel like this is the gateway to the Oscars. Yeah.\n\nSo if you can get here. Yes. Then maybe five years from now, I can get\n\ninto five years, like. Yeah. I figure it's a long plan, but, yeah, I'll be\n\na good game. It's a long game. Yeah.\n\nYeah. So how involved is your wife? Your wife in your fits?\n\nLike, does she give opinions? Yeah, she helps me out. Like she said, put that brooch on and you\n\nsaid okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nI wouldn't have even known that was a brooch if you wouldn't have pointed at it. I would have been like, I don't know what\n\nshe's talking. I go, I go, she's a page, right? Pages.\n\nLose her mind here. Lost her mind. I won't make you spell it, but yeah.\n\nNo, it is a brooch. I saw a lot of people had them. Yeah, there's a lot of guys.\n\nWell, actually, not a lot of people did, because you're wearing it now. All the men are going to start wearing them.\n\nYeah, yeah. Out of the bar. Trendsetters.\n\nThis is where it starts. At the bar. Do you ever.\n\nDo you ever come to these events and you're like, wow. I'm like one of the only comedians.\n\nDo you ever say a joke that just, like, doesn't land with all the respected actors? Yeah, yeah.\n\nI mean, if they don't know the context of, like, me being a comic, you can say something, especially a long story that can.\n\nOh, yeah. That's hard. Like, you will know when you know it's not\n\ngoing to hit even really hear you. You get out of it. They get their security and they're like, can\n\nyou get this guy? I'll wait till someone drags him off, and then I get back to them and go, let me finish\n\nwhat I was. Yeah. Let me get back into it.\n\nSo he golfs with some very famous people all the time.\n\nUm, do you have any advice for dealing with pressure on the golf course and on stage?\n\nBecause you're a calm man. You're a calm man. Like I gotta call you the Ice Man.\n\nIs that. Do they? Yes.\n\nAll right. Oh, God. He lived right.\n\nYeah. I don't know who he is. Uh, the ice man.\n\nWell, isn't that is that, uh, Top Gun?\n\nNate, you've already lost me. I was just trying. Yes, I'm the iceman.\n\nI mean, how do you stay calm before all these intense SNL monologue? Yeah.\n\nIt's, uh, you know, you prepare. Yeah. That's all you do.\n\nIf I get out of the preparation, I'll be in big trouble. And you study hard.\n\nHe goes. Maybe work hard for once. Maybe try a little harder.\n\nYeah. Just give it a shot.

I don't know why I jumped like that.\n\nThat was weird. That was very weird. I just have to say, we've interviewed a lot\n\nof men. Best dressed. Oh, you're my best dressed.\n\nAnd she never. She never says that. And I never compliment a man.\n\nIt's against my religion. I really I can't do it. Oh, my velvet, the satin.\n\nOh, it's so good. I appreciate it. Brunello Cuccinelli, are you single?\n\nI'm not. I'm very married. Oh.\n\nMe too. Very happy. What?\n\nWhat do I not look like? I could trap a man. Well, why did you ask me if I was?\n\nShe's looking for someone. I'm a wingman. I got some homeboys.\n\nOh, okay. Amazing. Thank you.\n\nI'm Paige, I'm doing the live stream. You send them right over to me. Wait.\n\nStart a group chat. You guys look, like, in the same color. Yeah.\n\nWe do. No. I'm obsessed.\n\nWe do? You guys have the same stylist. This looks good.\n\nI love it. So, did you want the red or did your stylist force it on you?\n\nIt looks great. I didn't mean it like that. Yeah, I don't know that.\n\nI thought about the pocket square, to be honest with you. The red is a nice pop, though.\n\nIt does look good. That's how you know. You didn't think about it.\n\nYou didn't even know he was wearing one. Alessio, over at Brunello and Jason Bolden, my stylist, they they they they conspired and\n\ncollabed and then they sent it to you. This whole thing. They said, hey, put this on.\n\nYou said, okay. And I said, okay. Yeah.\n\nHow many different glasses do you own?\n\nWe've all been wanting to know a lot. Yeah, I only take pictures in glasses. Yeah, I'm not sure why.\n\nIt makes you look like you know something we don't know. Yeah.\n\nWhat are you preparing? It's like. It's like the English.\n\nIt's like. It's like my version of a British accent. Yes yes yes yes yes yes.\n\nWho sounds so clever and witty? Everything he says sound unprepared because we don't have accents.\n\nWait. My brother. Oh, that's my brother from another.\n\nHe's running over my guy. Come on. He's literally just jumped over Kylie Jenner.\n\nNo, I'm just kidding. And now the men are hugging, and now the men are hugging.\n\nI thank you so much for coming out. Yeah. Thank you for stopping by.\n\nI'm not really sure why I came over here, but we don't. We're sorry.\n\nThree minutes of. You can yell at your publicist after because that's what she said.\n\nTraumatizing. And we get it. Three minutes that he'll never forget.\n\nThat's what she said. Get out of here. All right, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.\n\nOh, get out of here with your pocket square. Oh my God. Wait.\n\nNow we're joined by the one and only Tinashe. Oh my God. A vision.\n\nA vision. No, do not apologize to us. This corset is insane.\n\nI think it's insane. No, it's the texture. The color, the fit.\n\nIt's gorgeous. I feel like my rib cage is, like, overlapping right now.\n\nI'm obsessed. Wait, you have a sexual energy I can. It's radiating off you.\n\nNot only on the carpet, but in your music. Have you always, like, had just been sexy?\n\nHonestly, I feel like music is a great outlet for me to, like, bring that sex appeal, that ego, that alter ego.\n\nHonestly, I feel like in my day to day life, I'm like very chill, very toned down. Yeah.\n\nAnd so, like with my music, I feel like I can, like, walk, you know. So okay, you say like in your day to day,\n\nyou're toned down. So like, you're not going to the grocery store in this.\n\nUnfortunately not. What's your like normal day style. Like on sweatpants?\n\nYeah. Sweatpants. Hoodie.\n\nYeah. All the things. Like the comfiest clothes, no bra.\n\nYeah. So do you like getting dressed up for stuff like this, or are you, like, my feet hurt?\n\nI mean, it's nice. It's nice to be able to, like, have the range.\n\nYeah, the range to do both. Get a girl who can do both. Who do you like better?\n\nMusicians or actors? I thought you were gonna say me or you. And I was like, please answer.\n\nWe're live.\n\nWe are not going to tell anyone. We won't tell. I honestly, I actors are kind of chill, I\n\nlike them. Yeah. I do have to say.\n\nYeah. Musicians, some of them are a little. They are larger than life at times.\n\nYou have a lot of feelings they can be. I was going to say they can be quite emotional.\n\nOh my God, I dated one. He cried so much, but it was my fault. Yeah.\n\nWhen you go in there, what's your vibe? Are you a wallflower? Are you dancing?\n\nI'm going straight for the champagne. Yes. I'm gonna hit the dance floor.\n\nYes. Where I should be? Yes.\n\nJust bopping and grooving. I love it so much. Are you going to ask for a selfie from\n\nanyone? Or is that like, oh my gosh, I am so not the ask for selfies type.\n\nYeah, neither are we. Like in the bathroom in there. Are you ever just like, oh, and that's\n\nKendall Jenner chill. I'm like, oh my God, I've seen you all. You're all friends.\n\nYou're like, does anyone want a tampon? Yeah. Yeah, exactly.\n\nYou're like, everyone's a human inside. I'm like, oh my God. But you know, keep it chill.\n\nYeah. You always look so good with your fists. Are you very opinionated with your stylist?\n\nLike, I want to wear this. Yes, definitely. You have to be girl.\n\nYou have to be especially. I feel like once you've done a couple of carpets and you come out looking crazy.\n\nYeah, you know that you can't do that anymore. And you have to be kind of decisive.\n\nWell, you crushed it tonight. You truly did. We loved you so much.\n\nLook so beautiful. Thank you so much. So much fun in there.\n\nAnd we love your freckles. Yes. You could not be cuter.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you so much. Have fun and.\n\nYeah. Have fun. Get out of here.\n\nThank you so much for being here. Um, John, we've seen you at a few Vanity Fair parties.\n\nAre there any standout moments that still make you laugh when you think about them? I was here for the slap.\n\nWe were here for the slap. We were here for the mix up. The La La Land mix up.\n\nSo yeah, there's been quite a few standout moments in the bathroom during this lap. Yes, I was in the in the bathroom for both of\n\nthose, but I saw the aftermath. Yes, Ron Howard gave us the play by play. Never go to the bathroom at the end of the\n\nshow. It's going to. It's going to come back to haunt you.\n\nYeah. Oh my gosh, that's wild. Um, and you've both done drama and comedy.\n\nIf you could swap roles with one of your characters for a day, who would it be and why?\n\nOh, jeez. I mean, I don't think I'd want to swap characters, swap places with Don Draper.\n\nThat'd be a real bummer. Um, but I don't know, maybe. Maybe the guy in in Top Gun.\n\nThat'd be pretty fun. Run an aircraft carrier or something?\n\nI have to say, my character from Mad Men, because that would be great.\n\nThat's a good one to be in 1970. In Big sur. So it sounds like a fun time.\n\nYes. Thank you guys so much for being here. Have an amazing night.\n\nYou look. You look amazing. Thank you.\n\nYes. Beautiful color. I am now joined by the hottest couple in\n\ntown. Actually, in the world. We have dove, Cameron and Damiano.\n\nHello, guys. How are you? We're so good.\n\nHow are you? Very well. Thanks.\n\nQuestion. Did we plan the outfits together? Did we want to coordinate?\n\nYes. I knew I was going to be all black. And he.\n\nHe had a secret wish for me also to be all black. Do you typically get to decide first?\n\nI had a fever dream. I came to her and I was like, I want to be like the Beckhams.\n\nWow. So that we're we're working on it. That's a really good inspo.\n\nThat's a wonderful inspo. Now we off camera, we were talking about this and I just want to hit it real hard.\n\nYour style evolution, you were always great, but you were grungier and now you're going for a lot more classic.\n\nWhat was the what was the the impetus for this?\n\nUh, it looks like we are a new band, but we've been actually doing it for quite a lot, and I just need.\n\nI just felt like I needed something different and I needed to be more focused on, like, what I really want to do.\n\nIt's so chic. It's almost like 50s inspired that you're that you're rocking now.\n\nI love it so much, dove. I know we all know what a rock star you are, but is it awkward when you're, like, at a\n\nconcert and everyone's going nuts for this one? No, not at all.\n\nI'm usually the one going the most nuts. I listen, I'm just as obsessed, so I totally get it.\n\nI can listen, I would love to really talk to you, dove, but it's really hard to look at. If you could see close up what I'm seeing,\n\nit's so difficult to look at her. Brown people don't blush easily. But under my skin.\n\nYou are a knockout. Me knockout. It's fine.\n\nI'm a very gay man. He's perfectly safe. I've never dabbled in that.\n\nRight. Do you know Teyana Taylor, by any chance? Yes.\n\nYou're absolutely beautiful. Hi. Come say hi.\n\nJoin us. Hi, love. Hi.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna let you guys. I'm gonna let you guys go. Thank you for joining me.\n\nIt was so good to meet you both. Can I get one mic? Yes.\n\nLovely to see you guys, darling. Hello, darling. How are you?\n\nOkay, I'm going to help you talk. Talk to me about this number.\n\nHold on. What's going on? I see some needle and thread.\n\nOh, no. Okay, listen. In the car.\n\nI'm gonna. I'm gonna do this. Oh, damn.\n\nThe back's even better. Are you willing to show the back?\n\nYou guys, can we see that on camera, please? Damn.\n\nHave you seen that? Okay. Who are we wearing?\n\nLaquan smith. Oh, we love Laquan Smith. Is this custom?\n\nYes, it is runway. Okay. Question.\n\nYou've been to this event many times. Yes. Are you still intimidated by that?\n\nYes I am. See, I'm, like, nervous right now. I'm so shy and people don't know that I don't\n\nbelieve in Red Carpet. I'm trying to practice how I'm going to post up, like, okay, do I stand like this?\n\nDo I? Okay, here's the problem. So I practice my poses in the mirror.\n\nAnd then as soon as I get onto the red carpet and they're shouting, you forget it all. They'll be like, can you stand right here?\n\nI'll be like, okay, I know. And you look back thinking, that was one of my poses, man, it's a dirty game.\n\nWhy do we work on right now? You acted last year or the year before?\n\nLast year. Okay. Are we working on a new movie?\n\nWorking on a new project. Are we focusing on music?\n\nEverything. Yeah, I actually have three movies coming this year.\n\nAnd a show with Ryan Murphy I'm very, very excited about. Where are you finding the time?\n\nOh, baby, I don't even know. You're working every hour that God sends. Yeah.\n\nI'm, like, literally filming multiple things at once. And.\n\nAre you recording my music? Um.\n\nStay tuned. Let's see. That's a yes.\n\nThat's a yes, folks. We know how to read through that. Thank you so much.\n\nOkay, read the carpet. I'm gonna to try and get too many secrets out if I don't let her go.\n\nSo, Tiana, I'm gonna kiss you off for now. You look gorgeous. Thank you.\n\nThe incomparable Tiana.\n\nWe are so excited to be here with Michelle Rodriguez.\n\nWhat up? Okay, I can't drive. I don't have my driver's license.\n\nAn interview question, am I right? Do you have any advice for looking cool when driving?\n\nUh, do it right. Don't like hit people and stuff? Yeah, don't hit people.\n\nKeep your eye on the road. Keep your emotions to yourself.\n\nWell, we just found out she's from Jersey, so. And they learned that in Jersey to keep their\n\nemotions to themselves. I'm super stoked. You know, we got a Jersey boy as a winner for\n\nbest picture today. Yes. No.\n\nThat's so exciting. I love new Jersey I love Sean Baker, he's awesome.\n\nYes. Represent Sean so good. And how do you think the accents were?\n\nBecause I'm from Brooklyn too, and I thought they nailed it. It was pretty intense.\n\nYeah, yeah I he has a he has a tendency to pick like real, real people for the role. And then, you know, they always just come to\n\nthe table with great performances. I think every film that he's ever directed, he's just really he just knows how to capture\n\ntruth. You know what I mean? And you can feel it when you watch any of his\n\nfilms. So yeah, I'm super happy for him. Yes.\n\nShout out to Sean and Michelle. You've taken on so many badass female roles. Is there something you look for in particular\n\nwhen you're, like, reading scripts? Yeah. You know, because.\n\nBecause of the last name. Yeah. And because I'm a woman I've always had to\n\nbattle for the last 25 years. Cartels. Hookers.\n\nUm, maids. Anything that's poverty porn.\n\nSo I stay away from all that stuff. I basically, you know, I don't like to, uh, representation matters.\n\nIt really does. Well, what you're saying, what you're doing with your presence, I think matters.\n\nYou know, if I were, like, if everybody were doing, you know, amazing work and we had lots of representation.\n\nI could probably be an actress and not so much an activist, but for the last, you know, 25 years that's been pretty much my you're\n\nvery purposeful with the roles you take, for sure. I kind of have to be because nobody, you\n\nknow, there's not a lot of people doing it. So you got to kind of like, and you do not want to be just.\n\nYeah, squared into one place. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.\n\nNo. And speaking of not boring. No, we have to talk about your fashion\n\nbecause the cape. I'm obsessed. It's so powerful.\n\nAnd I love that. It's, like, tight and then, like, flaring out a little.\n\nAnd this is the color of the season. You're so on trend. Yeah.\n\nHow did you pick this? Was it between a couple or. You know Hugo is amazing.\n\nAnd he's he's the fantastic genius behind it all.\n\nBecause you know me, I'm such a tomboy. No, you wouldn't know it in this dress. You wouldn't know it.\n\nGorgeous. Is there a story behind this necklace? Because it's cool.\n\nYeah. Um. So, um, Basically, I get this jewelry from\n\nthis Polish designer who 3D prints everything. Wait.\n\nSo cool. Macabre. And so I have all of his jewelry remade in\n\ngold and silver. Wow. A true Jersey girl.\n\nA jersey figuring it out. Michelle, keep rocking it. I'm obsessed with you.\n\nI look up to you and have fun inside, okay? Beautiful night. Thank you for stopping by with us.\n\nThank you. Tan. Back to you.\n\nOh. Thank you.

Yeah, basically, babies are in bed.\n\nI get it. It really is what it is. Like.\n\nYou put your kids to bed and you're like, now it's our time. What do Mom and dad do on a night off other\n\nthan this? Oh, well, we have too much fun.\n\nNever too much, I'm sure. We love our good date nights. We love a good meal.\n\nThat's like my love language. I love good food, but can you go out or do you have people in?\n\nWe go out. Yeah we do. We do a date night every Friday.\n\nSo we make sure that we spend that quality time, which is good, especially when she's looking like this and wearing this kind of\n\ndress. Listen, I have been a gay man my entire life, but Sierra is one of the very few people on\n\nthis planet I've seen thinking, what is it about this lady that's doing something to my heart?\n\nI don't know. Since I was a kid, you've been. Oh, just phenomenal.\n\nCan you talk about what's going on in your life right now when it comes to work? Oh my gosh, so much.\n\nI'm excited.

Of course she plays.\n\nYou loved her music ever since. One, two step and goodies. Don't get me started.\n\nI think that we just have a great time just to be able to raise kids and do this. And obviously we're also getting the\n\nproduction space too, with new productions. And so we're getting going. We're excited about some things we have going\n\non.

Because, you know, we're Valentino folks.\n\nExactly. But I'm wearing Dolce Gabbana tonight. The gloves.\n\nThe gloves that. Oh, wait. Are you kidding?\n\nWait. Coleman, we've taken over. We've fully taken over there.\n\nI have a cat at home. You have a cat? Do you have a cat?\n\nI don't have a cat. I just need one. But my husband calls me the cat, so I wear\n\ncat things. You know. Exactly.\n\nSo. Yeah, but this is like I wanted this this outfit to be called good night.\n\nIt's like. Good night. Oscars.\n\nGood night. Shut it down now. Are you sweating?\n\nNo, no, he doesn't sweat. Colman Domingo doesn't sweat. Coleman.\n\nSweat. If you do anything illegal. No, there's no fingerprints.\n\nThat's why the gloves. Precisely. And that's why we're amateurs at these\n\nthings. You can't steal a snack. I need gloves here.\n\nI need gloves. You don't want to try better next year. That's why I came over here.\n\nI'm like, no gloves. And let's be honest, you don't want to touch us.\n\nBut you're not. We're mere mortals. We look like idiots without gloves.\n\nMore gloves. I'm out of here. We miss the glove memo.\n\nYeah. Yeah. All right, keep going.\n\nGet gloves. This was it. I think we've done it.\n\nYeah, we've done it. We did it. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you.

That's why I'm friends with stand up\n\ncomedians, because they make me funnier. I was in bottom. You were incredible.\n\nI was in bottoms. Okay. I feel like people ask you this all the time,\n\nbut modeling or acting, you got to pick one. What are we doing? I couldn't possibly do that.\n\nThe thing is, you. All your actors are in campaigns, so, you know, you don't have to choose one.\n\nWow. She's right. All your favorite actors are on billboards.\n\nYou're right. You don't ever have to pick one thing. Being multi-hyphenate.\n\nUm, Kia. Thank you for having me. I can't believe, Colman.\n\nThank you for coming. That was amazing. That was pretty cool.\n\nThank you, thank you. Get out of here.

And, um. Uh, one for Agatha.\n\nYeah. I love a group chat after it's gone. I get very sad when something's over, so it\n\nmakes me happy to continue on with the group. It's like a family. Yes.\n\nIt is. Oh. That's amazing.\n\nAnd have you ever been to this party before? A few times, but it's every time as overwhelming as the time before.\n\nOkay. Just by the sheer amount of star wattage.\n\nYeah. It's true. It's true.\n\nConsolidated into one place. Yeah. It's overwhelming.\n\nI remember the first time I was like, I couldn't even make eye contact because it was too much in one room.\n\nIt's true. No, I know that's how I'm feeling. Yeah.\n\nI don't know what to do with myself, but. Well, good luck and thank you. And thank you so much.\n\nPain gowns. I know we're matching. We're matching this evening.\n\nYou look fabulous.

Did you guys just fly here from a second ago?\n\nIn the words of Taylor Swift. Yeah. Jet lag is a construct, a construct.\n\nHonestly, it's for mentally weak people. He got on a 6 a.m.. What is it, 6 a.m.?\n\nFlight to land. JetBlue. You're welcome.\n\nBecause you're a man of the people. I'm a man of the people. My carbon footprint is going to be\n\ndistributed evenly. Yes. Yeah.\n\nThere you go. It's important. Congrats.\n\nLast night was amazing. You two have incredible chemistry. Yeah.\n\nHow long? Now. Come on.\n\nHave you guys actually been friends? Like for real? The year 2008 and then 2009, you had a big\n\nfight when Pink Friday by Nicki Minaj came out.\n\nThat's when that's important. We really. That's your anniversary.\n\nYou're both off book on the same Nicki Minaj songs. And then it was like, okay, because our\n\nfriends were like, I was in the sketch group. He was in the improv group. We were both gay and they were like, be\n\nfriends. We're like, no, we're not going to be friends just cause we're gay.\n\nAnd then we were friends just for two. They're amazing. Podcast.\n\nI feel like, how the hell have we not met before? Have you been?\n\nI know, I know, it's rude. Okay, this is the scoop. We've been trying to get y'all on the podcast\n\nfor ages. No, no, we're coming tomorrow. We're coming, we're coming on it.\n\nWe're coming tonight. Yeah. This is a podcast.\n\nThis is the podcast. Record it actually. Yes.\n\nMe and Matt have hung out before. We've got. We've been in bed.\n\nIt's crazy. We've gotten in bed. I haven't even gotten a Snapchat.\n\nI haven't gotten anything in these streets. So you guys, when you go in there, do you approach people or just vibe alone?\n\nIt depends. We get a little brave. Like he had to convince me to go up to\n\nSebastian Stan number one talent crush. It was amazing. No, I need to go up to Sebastian Stan.\n\nI'm obsessed. Jawline. Look at us talking.\n\nWe forgot we're in. We're actually we're. This is a job we have to do.\n\nWe literally forgot when you guys go in there, we you when you guys go in there, do you separate like, do you break and then come\n\nback? No, no, I'm, I'm glomming on to this one. Come on.\n\nYeah, yeah. Who's more outgoing? It depends on the context.\n\nYou guys are both quite shy.\n\nYeah. You're kind of. You give wallflower.\n\nWait. Have you guys ever hooked up accidentally? No.\n\nNever. No. We keep it.\n\nWe're sisters. Us neither. But like, the night is young.\n\nYou got to talk to this. We're at Vanity Fair. You want to hook up with Amelia?\n\nI love how he's like. Please stop talking to us. No, no, no, we've been eating up so much\n\nairtime. You have to talk to her. No.\n\nAmelia, come. Hello. It's a literal party.\n\nOh, my God, all these funny hot people. I know it's too many. Too many hot, too many hot funny people.\n\nOh, we're getting there. We love you. Yeah, yeah.\n\nGood luck on your pictures. Good luck. I have to let you guys know.\n\nAmelia Dimoldenberg. And I love how they put how to pronounce my name.\n\nDemi Moore. And let's be honest, everyone, everyone says Amelia Demi Moore.\n\nAnd you know exactly who we're talking about. It's Amelia. Dims.\n\nAmelia dims. We went up to you two days ago and said, do you have any advice for the carpet?\n\nYeah. Can I tell you I was very starstruck meeting you the other night.\n\nI'm just very. Is that why I thought you were shy? I am shy, but I'm just very impressed by you.\n\nI was watching you on the television yesterday when I was trying to prep, and I was trying to relax, and you were just on\n\nBravo, and I was like, oh, my God, there you are. You relaxed.\n\nDid it relax you? Absolutely relaxed. Me.\n\nNothing like really hot, funny people in a house to relax me.\n\nNo. Amelia. How does it feel to be interviewed?\n\nYeah, guys, I feel like I'm like, I just had a tequila shot.\n\nI'm feeling. Where is everyone getting the tequila? Yeah.\n\nNo one's offered us over to us. I feel like. Yeah.\n\nYeah. I mean, but then, anyway, um, it feels great to be interviewed, actually, because it's a\n\nbit of a switch to me doing all the questions.\n\nCan I call it out, though? Amelia obviously crushing it in comedy. A journalistic icon, but fashion wise,\n\nyes, it's next level. I'm screenshotting all her looks. This is gorgeous.\n\nGuys, this has, like, texture to it. Yeah, I feel like they're not getting the vibe.\n\nYeah, it actually feels good. It's almost like an animal. It's giving the British JLo I said it.\n\nWait, what? I said. And now we've said it.\n\nObsessed. And now we've said it. Obsessed.\n\nI just said it. Okay. Obsessed.\n\nNow my head's gonna explode. Wait, how? How are you guys?\n\nSee? She's turning it. Turning it?\n\nNo one. No one's asked that yet. No one's asked us.\n\nAnd we haven't. We don't really like reflecting on our own feelings because then we get into a dark\n\nplace. It's true. But I feel like you're killing it.\n\nWe're trying our best, and we haven't looked at the comments yet. We'll find out soon.\n\nDon't read the comments. Our team is going like this constantly. Keep going.\n\nAmelia. Get in there and we'll ",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nWhat's up, Vogue?\n\nI'm Doja Cat and we are performing at the Oscars today.\n\nAnd so I'm getting ready\n\nand I want you to watch and I'm nervous.\n\nA healthy amount of nervous.\n\nLet's go, come on.\n\nIt is 12:15 in the afternoon.\n\nShe needs to be ready by 3:00 PM for the carpet.\n\nThe dress is not here yet,\n\nbut I have all faith within Hollywood traffic\n\nand Oscars madness that it will be here.\n\nWe did our final fitting last night.\n\nIt is an insane piece of couture that Balmain did.\n\nShe looks like Betty Boop.\n\nIt's really crazy.\n\nWith Amala, who's like my sister,\n\nbut then being Doja Cat\n\nand showing up in leopard print,\n\nI don't know if anyone else\n\ncan really pull that off beyond her.\n\nSo I'm performing Diamonds Are Forever by Sherry Bassey.\n\nI wanted to respect the original sound\n\nbeing it's from like the 70s\n\nand so I wanted to channel her\n\nbut also give just like a essence of myself within it.\n\nI love doing things that are not usual to me.\n\nI'm learning how to talk as a singer.\n\nAnd so I'm trying to split the difference between\n\nbeing raspy and myself\n\nand also being like this,\n\njust giving them a little bit of warmth and tone.\n\nIt's protective towards the voice,\n\nbut without also, see, there's two different...\n\nIt's like I'm trying to find the middle ground of that.\n\nAnd I feel like that voice comes with a character.\n\nMy vocal coach did suggest that I speak in a dopey tone,\n\nso I didn't wanna scare you when he walked in\n\nand start talking like this.\n\nSo the dresses for today have arrived.\n\nBalmain has done two amazing custom looks for us.\n\nThe leopard print is where we're going for carpet.\n\nIt's an insane moment.\n\nThis is all hand beaded from top to bottom.\n\nI know there was like 50 different artisans on it\n\nthat were stitching by hand all of these insane beads\n\nand our lovely tailor here in LA has been up all evening\n\nbeating the scarf for us to go around her neck.\n\nThey had this dress that was built I think in 1957\n\nthat this was inspired by, but Olivier did his spin on it\n\nand it has like the sweetheart neckline.\n\nIt's definitely corseted to the gods.\n\nBut yeah, it's just super special.\n\nAmala is moving into this new album cycle that there's a bit\n\nof an 80s essence.\n\nAnd so this is kind of bringing it to life,\n\nespecially with the glam.\n\nSo we were inspired by Mugatu, I'm just kidding.\n\nI love my natural hair and I love playing with it.\n\nI love like the shapes that it can take on.\n\nAnd so I really loved the idea of sweeping it upward.\n\nIt's kind of something that's been calling me\n\nfor the last couple of months.\n\nI'm just loving this kind of square top head shape.\n\nAnd so I wanted to bring it to this\n\n'cause I think the dress is so incredibly strong\n\nand to kind of keep the upper head area more top\n\nand more separate from the dress as opposed\n\nto long trusses hanging over the dress.\n\nI think it lets the dress stand out.\n\nI think right off the bat, you can kind of compare it a bit\n\nto Grace Jones and the silhouette of it.\n\nI love that head shape, I love angular hair too.\n\nI think like it was something maybe more prominent\n\nin the 80s and I want to kind of play with that.\n\nI think that can be really fun\n\n'cause I can take my hair when it's not like this,\n\nbut like in the morning,\n\nI can just go like that and it stays like that.\n\nI go like this, it stays like that.\n\nIf I sweep it back, it's like very malleable\n\nand why not take advantage?\n\nSo I have conversations with him for the most part\n\nbecause hair is like hair.\n\nIt's a very defining characteristic of the body.\n\nMakeup is depending on where you are creatively.\n\nI think for this, me and Ivan\n\njust wanted to be very like, elegant, sexy,\n\nand not anything too experimental.\n\nI think a lot of the energy is coming from the dress\n\nand the silhouette.\n\nWith the gold dress,\n\nOlivier did a blue version of it\n\nthat was a long sleeved a couple collections ago,\n\nand I fell in love with it when I saw it then.\n\nBut when this opportunity came up for Oscars,\n\nit's a really special moment for her.\n\nThis being her first time going to Oscars,\n\nlooking like a female version\n\nof the Oscar made me quite excited.\n\nSo this is what she's wearing after the show.\n\nIt's, again, an insane amount of bead work\n\nthat there was multiple people in the 40s\n\nis what I remember hand beading this.\n\nAnd then at the bottom,\n\nthere's a fringe, there's a fabric fringe,\n\nand then there's a beaded fringe.\n\nSo when she moves,\n\nthere's a lot of beautiful movement to it.\n\nWe have some very amazing pieces from Messika\n\nand this necklace has not been worn yet\n\nand it's super special.\n\nIt's like, I don't wanna say how many carats it is,\n\nbut it's a canary diamond and it's insane.\n\nIt's always experimenting in the end\n\nbecause we don't get jewelry kind of till the last second,\n\njust for insurance reasons.\n\nBut I want to try it with the dress.\n\nBut they did this really beautiful scarf\n\nthat just adds to that like classic elegance on the carpet\n\nthat feels like it's an accessory enough.\n\nBut yeah, we'll see.\n\nWhen we get to the dressing, we'll find out.\n\nAll right, Vogue, I'm done with makeup and hair\n\nand we are gonna move on to getting dressed.\n\nIt's really, really, really special.\n\nYou look incredibly stunning, I want to cry.\n\nI know that this is honoring Barbara Broccoli tonight.\n\nSo I mean, it's an honor for me really\n\nthat I get to do this.\n\nIt really is a classic\n\nand a perfect series of films\n\nthat I really am very grateful.\n\nShe's gonna be a Bond girl.\n\nI hope she enjoys it.\n\nOkay, he wants me to be a Bond girl.\n\nI'm down, but I don't know what that entails.\n\nBut yes, I hope they enjoy it.\n\nI hope everybody at the Bond Industries enjoys that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThat's a wrap and I am going\n\nto go perform now for the Oscars.\n\nWish me luck and thanks again, Vogue, for everything.\n\n[bright music]",

        "content": "How did you each experience emigration growing up?\n\nSaheem Ali: I’m the one who left, right? I had the privilege to leave and I left, very specifically, because I wanted to be an artist. So I have my own guilt about not staying and not contributing artistically to the place where I was born because that drain is one-directional, if you never return. I empathize so deeply with Omara, who feels drawn to stay in her country, because it’s not the version that I chose for myself. It’s so beautiful to show a story where young people decide to stay and invest, and then have that second chance in the future. What I love about Marco’s perspective [is his centering of] the homegrown Juan de Marcos, someone who actually had their foot on the ground, as the engine of this particular story.\n\nRamirez: I grew up around a lot of people who were experiencing a kind of shared nostalgia. For my grandparents, specifically, music was their connection to this place I grew up hearing about as if it was Never Never Land. As the years passed, their memories of it seemed to just get brighter, and nostalgia seeped in. In a way, the memory part—the ’50s part—of this show has been purposely written and designed and performed to feel like it’s being remembered…not too grounded, because it’s not a docudrama. Every time we go to the ’50s, we see it as how this woman remembers things. I think I grew up like that. My own connection to the island was almost entirely through music, and it wasn’t until later in life that I actually got to visit and realize these people are living a shared experience. This is a whole other perspective. This is a whole other place. It was magical being able to do that and realize these people want their story to be told from their point of view, because it’s very often told from the outside.\n\nWere you excited, through this project, to explore the parallel versions of yourselves that stayed behind?\n\nRamirez: 100%. I grew up around a lot of political conversations held around pig roasts and domino games, but I also just heard very human stories. “Did you hear who got sick? Did you hear who got married?” And, once in a while, people would have relatives come visit and we would see these people pop into our lives and then go back, and it was like, Well, whatever happened to that aunt? And I would hear my grandparents on the phone talking to these people, or hear them sobbing when someone passed who they hadn’t seen in 10 years. I was very excited to tell a story about the kind of disconnect that happens between people who really love each other, but are living in almost different dimensions. Though, in some ways, they’re living in the exact same dimension. Those connections never go away.",

        "content": "Transcript\n\nHey Vogue, it's Leighton Meester,\n\nand I'm here to walk you through my skincare routine\n\nand an easy little makeup look.\n\nMy first step is I wash my face.\n\nI use this,\n\nand I use it on this really cool questionable device.\n\nI've been asked a lot of questions\n\nby anyone who notices this,\n\nand you can use it to wash your face.\n\nLet's just keep it at that.\n\nIt vibrates, which is really fun.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nI've been using it for quite some time.\n\nI find it to be really effective in cleaning my face,\n\nand it feels good.\n\nI usually use this, OCuSOFT Lid Scrub,\n\nbecause I have dry eyes.\n\nYes, I do.\n\nIt really just, it seems counterintuitive,\n\nbut I just clean my eyes,\n\nand I guess it helps me not to have dry eyes.\n\nThe next thing that I use is Real Ferment Micro Essence.\n\nI just feel like it kind of like re-wets my skin.\n\nThis is something\n\nthat my sister-in-law told me about.\n\nI saw this like in her van\n\nwhen we were on like a surf trip,\n\nand I was like, What the hell is that?\n\nIt's snail mucin.\n\nAdam gets into the mucin.\n\nWe share, we're like a mucin family.\n\nI feel very moisturized right now.\n\nAnd then can you believe\n\nI have another serum that I put on?\n\nMoisture Boost Plumping Serum.\n\nI did get on the SPF train pretty early,\n\nwhich I'm glad about.\n\nI use these two things usually together.\n\nOne is tinted and one isn't.\n\nI mix it together, and it's kind of lighter.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nIf we're being honest,\n\nthat's like mostly what I just do most days.\n\nBut I'm just gonna bump it up a little bit\n\n'cause this is fun.\n\nThere's no reason why I'm doing this part.\n\nIt's fun, and they're sort of like getting prepped.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nIt is Kosas.\n\nWhen I was like late teens, early 20s,\n\nI got really like into\n\nmy little sitting on the floor in front of the mirror\n\nkind of makeup routine.\n\nI basically would do like five auditions in a day,\n\nand so there was just like a moment of meditation.\n\nI had like hot rollers\n\nand like a full like face of makeup,\n\nwhich over, you know, the last 20 years\n\nI've really just been like,\n\nI actually like how my skin looks without foundation on.\n\nI'm gonna do a little eye makeup.\n\nI'll just use what's ostensibly the lightest color in here.\n\nAnd I do that.\n\nYou just slap it on there,\n\nand I kind of rub in this little zone.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nThe glam stuff is like a really fun element\n\nwhen you get ready to go to an event.\n\nIt's like this really glamorous\n\naspect to the business that I enjoy.\n\nSpeaking of glam,\n\nthis one right here, this dark guy.\n\nI just kind of go a little bit closer,\n\nblend it a little bit, just a little bit.\n\nWow.\n\nTake a look at this cool eyeliner.\n\nIt all squished out.\n\nNot to fear, you use a little brush like this.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nIt's definitely like me time\n\ngetting your little skincare\n\nand even just, whatever, minimal makeup in.\n\nI just think this is so pretty,\n\nand I kind of just wanna like try it.\n\nI'm gonna make my eyes a little bit shinier.\n\nI like this kind of thing.\n\nThis is, I think, for bronzing...\n\nContouring.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nAnd I kind of put it here 'cause I see people do that.\n\n[Leighton laughs]\n\nWell, I should probably do this part.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nI like to try to just be nice to myself.\n\nIt's so basic, but it's very helpful for me\n\nnot to say negative words about myself.\n\nIt would be like in meetings or on set,\n\nI'd be like, This is a dumb idea, but whatever.\n\nOr, I'm sorry to ramble on, I'm sorry to rant.\n\nIt's more helpful generally for me\n\nto just say nice words to myself about myself.\n\nI just sort of instinctively\n\nstart absorbing that and believing it.\n\nOkay, mascara.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nMy kids, they get what we do.\n\nThey come on location a lot.\n\nI don't think that they're phased at all\n\nbecause they get a lot of us off set\n\nand a lot of us like not working,\n\nwhich has been always like a really big benefit\n\nfor both of us.\n\nNow, actually, I'm gonna use this like shiny thing.\n\nI have seen this little thing happen before,\n\nand I don't mind.\n\nI'm gonna do it.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna do this,\n\nwhich is like for your lips and cheeks.\n\nThis thing is real left field.\n\nYou won't believe that I'm using this, an essential balm.\n\nAnd it looks like this,\n\nand I feel like it kind of looks cool up here.\n\nIt just looks a little bit like, you know, dewy and wet.\n\nAnd then I guess this would be the right time\n\nto do this part.\n\nI have more blush, and it's this crazy,\n\nI mean, it's so bright,\n\nbut it's kind of subtle.\n\nI know that I try really hard to be all shiny,\n\nbut now I'm doing this matte powder thing.\n\nLip liners, to me,\n\nthey're just too concrete so much of the time\n\nwhere I'm like, I'm locked in,\n\nand this is what I'm gonna have to do and stick with.\n\nBut if I think if you just kind of like\n\njust do it a little bit and then kind of like smudge it.\n\nGroundbreaking, I know.\n\n[light upbeat music]\n\nSo I'll do this, this little guy.\n\nThis is new to me.\n\nI've had makeup artists do this.\n\nThis smells really good.\n\nThis was so very fun.\n\nThank you for watching.\n\nBye!

        "content": "What happens when Vogue picks up the phone and asks its friends—designers, models, and people with seriously good taste—to clean out their closets? You get the Vogue Vintage Market, an in-person, one-day-only shopping event packed with archival gems, runway relics, and one-off pieces that come with stories worth telling. Plus, there’s a seriously covetable selection of items sourced from eBay—and don’t forget, the event (on Saturday, March 29, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Roll & Hill) is open to the public with RSVP and donation in the Vogue app, with 100% of proceeds supporting those impacted by the recent Los Angeles fires.\n\nAmong the standouts: Kendall Jenner’s 2004 micro mini and matching fanny pack from a cult-favorite Dior collection, one of several pieces she donated. There’s also a slinky Galliano slip dress (the same style Anna Wintour wore to the 1996 Met Gala), generously offered up by Emily Rockefeller. Supermodel Karen Elson is parting ways with a lavender 2010 Givenchy top, gifted to her by Riccardo Tisci himself. And don’t miss the sparkly Alice + Olivia dress Taylor Swift wore when she was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nAnd that’s just a taste of what’s in store. Each piece at the Vogue Vintage Market comes with a backstory—whether it’s been plucked from the runway, worn by a cultural icon, or handpicked by one of Vogue’s closest friends. Spend the afternoon flipping through the racks, discovering hidden gems, and walking away with a piece of fashion history (or two). Below, a sneak peek at some of our favorite finds.\n\nPhoto: Jules Elmurib\n\nKendall Jenner’s Dior 2004 Skirt and Fanny Pack\n\nKendall Jenner’s donation—a Dior micro mini logo skirt and coordinating fanny pack—packs a double punch of fashion history. Both pieces hail from the house’s 2004 “Rasta” capsule collection, a provocative and instantly recognizable drop that channeled green, yellow and red colors and spirit into the glossy world of Y2K-era Dior. Photographed memorably on Gisele Bündchen by Nick Knight, the collection became emblematic of early-aughts excess and the bold, if controversial, cultural mashups of John Galliano’s Dior reign. Add to that the Jenner provenance, and you’ve got a slice of fashion lore ready for a new home.\n\nPhoto: Jules Elmurib Photo: Vogue Runway\n\nKaren Elson’s Pre-Fall 2010 Givenchy Blouse\n\nFrom Karen Elson’s closet comes this sheer lavender blouse, a prime example of Riccardo Tisci’s Givenchy in its cool-girl prime. Designed for the house’s pre-fall 2011 collection, the top reflects the era when Tisci’s darkly romantic aesthetic was everywhere. “This was during Riccardo Tisci’s tenure at Givenchy, occasionally he would gift the models with a piece or two after a show and I was the lucky recipient of the blouse,” Elson shares. “I wore it to a few parties over the years but sadly it’s been hung in closet for way too long and I felt like it needed another lease of life by someone who would be as excited as I was when I received the piece!”\n\nPhoto: Jules Elmurib NASHVILLE, TN - OCTOBER 16: Taylor Swift waves to Alan Jackson after performing his song \"Where Were You\" at the 41st Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame induction ceremony at the Renaissance Hotel on October 16, 2011 in Nashville, Tennessee.

The strapless, sequin-strewn number perfectly captured Swift’s early-2010s “princess” aesthetic, back when she was cementing her status as both a country darling and a red carpet style star. Equal parts sparkle and significance, it’s a chance to own a piece of Swiftian fashion history.\n\nPhoto: Jules Elmurib Photo: Getty Images\n\nCindy Crawford’s Spring 2005 Dior Tank\n\nStraight from Cindy Crawford’s closet, this “Dior Not War” tank top from the brand’s spring 2005 collection is peak Y2K fashion with a message. Designed by John Galliano, the mint-green version was look 64 on the runway, part of a collection that saw Galliano pivot toward more wearable, pop culture-infused pieces—think logo tees and bouclé suits. Crawford gave the top its red carpet moment at the Mr. & Mrs. Smith premiere in 2005, cementing it as both a supermodel staple and a snapshot of mid-2000s fashion’s cheeky, slogan-loving era. Now, it’s ready for a new rebel.\n\nPhoto: Jules Elmurib Photo: Vogue Runway\n\nLauren Santo Domingo’s Resort 2010 Prada Dress\n\nFew dresses can claim to have sparked an entire business model, but this mixed-patterned Prada number from the brand’s 2010 resort collection did just that. It was the piece that inspired Lauren Santo Domingo—whose closet is the stuff of fashion fantasy—to launch Moda Operandi’s now-famous trunk shows, allowing shoppers to buy looks straight off the runway. After spotting the dress, Santo Domingo tracked it down immediately, realizing she couldn’t be the only one craving that instant access. Now, it’s your turn to make it yours.\n\nPhoto: Jules Elmurib Photo: Vogue Runway\n\nLoewe’s Fall 2023 Silk Dress\n\nA future heirloom if there ever was one, this white silk Loewe dress opened Jonathan Anderson’s Fall 2023 collection—and quickly earned its place in the fashion canon. Woven with a hazy, blurred floral motif, it struck a delicate balance between artistry and wearability, so much so that it was featured in last year’s Met Costume Institute exhibition Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. Not quite vintage, but already museum-worthy, this is the kind of piece serious collectors dream about. Donated by Loewe.\n\nPhoto: Jules Elmurib Photo: Vogue Runway\n\nVersace’s Spring 2002 Daisy Print Skirt\n\nThis stretch mini skirt from Versace’s spring 2002 collection is a punchy ode to Y2K maximalism, splashed with the collection’s signature cartoonish daisy print. Donatella Versace dialed up the pop-art energy that season, sending models down the runway in bold florals that felt straight out of a Warhol canvas, filtered through a mod-meets-early-2000s lens. Playful, unapologetically loud, and pure Versace, this skirt captures an era when more was more—and makes a statement that still hits today. Donated by Alexandra Longanecker.\n\nPhoto: Jules Elmurib Photo: Getty Images\n\nEmily Rockefeller’s Galliano 1996 Dress\n\nA master of the slinky bias cut, John Galliano delivered one of his signatures with this blue and white floral slip dress, featuring delicate spaghetti straps and ethereal sprays of flowers. Plus, the dress carries extra fashion pedigree: a near-identical version was worn by Anna Wintour to the 1996 Met Gala, held in homage to Christian Dior. It’s a quintessential example of Galliano’s romantic yet razor-sharp design sensibility—a piece that bridges red carpet history and enduring elegance. Donated by Emily Rockefeller.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Actors Nicole Brydon Bloom and Justin Theroux first met in 2022, when their mutual friend, actor Louisa Jacobson, introduced them at a private party at the Lower Manhattan bar The Nines. “After the party, a group of us went to grab a drink nearby,” Nicole remembers. “It was an abnormally cold night in New York City—about six degrees—and Justin very kindly offered me his gloves, which I gratefully accepted and promptly returned once we were back inside.”\n\nThe next morning, Nicole got a surprise text from Justin that said: “This yours?” with a photo attached. “It was a picture of him holding my little criss-crossed diamond ring which I had worn, and sadly assumed I’d lost, the night before,” Nicole explains. “Turns out it had slipped off my cold finger into his large gloves when I returned them. Justin put his hands into the glove the next morning and the ring slid halfway onto his finger. He likes to joke that I proposed first, the very first night we met!”\n\n“I for sure thought leaving the ring in my glove was a move,” Justin jokes. “Which now, knowing Nicole as well as I do, it certainly was not. She has left more jewelry, jackets, and bags in places than I can count. So, definitely not a move.” Justin also remembers being smitten with Nicole within the first 10 minutes of talking to her—before even asking her name. “I pointed her out across the room to my friend Rassi and when he saw her he did a double take, turned to me and literally said, ‘She is the one,’” Justin remembers. “I had no way of knowing how prescient his comment would turn out to be. I then begged him to go over to collect her name, which like an idiot I had not gotten.”\n\nA year and a half after they started dating, Justin proposed during a vacation on the coast of Italy. It was raining and cloudy when they arrived at Hotel Il Pellicano on the coast of Monte Argentario, and they were very jet-lagged. “We almost skipped dinner but decided to take advantage of our first evening on the coast together and ended up having a really poignant conversation over a candlelit dinner,” Nicole recalls. “While eating, a radiant, full blue moon came out and left us both in awe. Justin suggested bringing our drinks down to the water. He popped back to the room, under the guise of getting us some towels, but was really collecting the ring. We were looking out at the water and the moon when he proposed. He said some of the most beautiful things. It was wonderful—we were both crying.”",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "In the decade since Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin’s divorce brought “conscious uncoupling” into the zeitgeist, a lot has changed: “Instead of people approaching me with, ‘Why did you say that?’, they now approach me with, ‘How do you do that?’” Paltrow shared in British Vogue.\n\nIt makes sense. After all, break-ups, separations, and divorces are hard. In fact, the ending of a relationship is one of the most painful situations we can experience—especially if betrayal, infidelity, or a toxic dynamic contributed to it. As psychologist Dr. Gerald Stein notes, “it sometimes takes longer to recover from the end of relationships with the living than those who are dead.” Given that fact, who wouldn’t be curious about a strategy that promises to ease some of the agony?\n\nWhat is conscious uncoupling?\n\nThough it’s commonly believed that Paltrow invented the phrase “conscious uncoupling,” she didn’t—she actually learned about it from her and Martin’s couples therapist. (For the record, even Paltrow says she was skeptical about the idea at the time.)\n\nUse of the word “uncoupling” goes back to at least the 1940s, when it was sometimes embraced as a gentler way to describe divorce. It gained more traction in the 1970s, when sociologist Diane Vaughan proposed her “uncoupling theory,” which examined the phases relationships typically move through as they unravel.\n\nHowever, it was Katherine Woodward Thomas’s 2009 book Conscious Uncoupling: 5 Steps to Living Happily Even After that really coined the phrase we now know and love (or loathe). “A conscious uncoupling is a breakup or divorce that is characterized by a tremendous amount of goodwill, generosity, and respect, where those separating strive to do minimal damage to themselves, to each other, and to their children,” Woodward Thomas wrote. She added that to be successful, both parties must “intentionally seek to create new agreements and structures designed to set everyone up to win, flourish, and thrive moving forward in life.”\n\nHow to consciously uncouple\n\nBut how to do that? According to clinical psychologist Molly Burrets, PhD, an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California, conscious uncoupling is all about taking a “mindful approach” to parting ways: “It challenges the traditional narrative of contentious breakups, and emphasizes personal growth and mutual respect,” she says.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "There was a time not long ago when the human body—any human body—was out of fashion, at least in the art world. In 2014, New York magazine critic Jerry Saltz wrote a withering indictment of the abstract, decorator-friendly, and ultimately banal style he described as “Zombie Formalism,” which seemed to be suddenly everywhere. At that time, in the mid-aughts, perhaps the most controversial thing an artist could do was to simply depict real figures of any kind, particularly people. The human being, the original subject of art that had concerned painters since time immemorial, was suddenly, somehow, uncool.\n\nThank God that’s over. Figuration is back in vogue and this season at the Bourse, the Pinault family’s private museum in Paris’s 2nd arrondissement, there is not one abstract canvas in sight.\n\nThe exhibition there, “Corps et Âmes,” is dedicated to over 100 works by more than 41 artists who span mediums, geographies, and chronologies, filling the entire Tadao Ando–renovated rotunda with bodies. Think: an Auguste Rodin ballerina in eyeshot of Deana Lawson portraits; Marlene Dumas canvases in conversation with nearby Peter Doig; a Richard Avedon photograph meeting one by Anne Imhof. Show-stopping moments come by way of three films by Cuban-American performance artist Ana Mendieta (she only ever made about 100 of them) and an entire suite of monumental Georg Baselitz canvases that debuted at the 2015 Venice Biennale.",

        "source": "https://www.vogue.com/",
        "content": "Vogue: How does it feel to see the show out in the world and to be connecting with viewers?\n\nAbdullah Saeed: This is the first time I’m being heavily reviewed, and I’m super relieved to see that the critical response is good. We were certified fresh. As the first-time creator of a scripted show, I did not know what that timeline looked like, because I’ve never watched it that closely on any of the shows I’ve watched. You know, you just think, How’s it doing on Rotten Tomatoes? But when it’s your thing, you’re like, Oh, my God. A really good friend of mine, Shal Ngo, just released his horror film Control Freak on Hulu, and it’s kind of fortuitous and fun that we had something come out at the same time. He posted about this earlier; he was like, “I’m obsessively watching this Rotten Tomatoes score,” and I was like, “I’m doing it too,” because whether we like it or not, or want to admit it or not, it’s such a big part of the validation for a show or movie in our time and place. It’s been a funny experience to watch that, but the audience thing is totally separate, right? Because it’s not so quantitative—it’s purely qualitative. In the streaming age, we don’t necessarily know what kind of ratings or viewership we’re getting, so what we know is that people come up to us or you have people hitting you up. My friend is a comedy writer from Long Island, and he went home and was like, “Yo, all of my Long Island friends from home are watching your show.” I was like, okay, it cracked something there, right? I love the idea that there’s a bunch of six-foot-three white dudes in Long Island watching Deli Boys.\n\nI love the territory that the show explores about the ways in which we see our parents, even—or especially—when they don’t live up to our ideals. Did you always know you wanted to tell a family story?\n\nYou know, it really started out as the best prism for jokes; it was a sample script, so I was kind of trying to demonstrate my joke-writing and wasn’t putting too much pressure on the emotional story. I think as a writer, I have the most to learn about the emotional aspects of a story. I’m constantly learning more about this medium of writing, which I’ve only been doing for about eight years. I look to my fellow EPs, to Jenni [Konner] and Michelle [Nader] in particular, when it comes to story and character and sort of learning that stuff.",

With this new season comes a forthcoming wardrobe shift, too: It is prime time to shed those heavy coats, and allow lighter outfit layering to shine. Goodbye, heavy-duty puffer coats—and hello sleek leather jackets and lightweight trenches! But there is one A-lister who is not ready to bid adieu to winter just yet: Jennifer Lawrence. The Oscar-winning star was spotted bundling up and keeping warm in New York City today alongside husband Cooke Maroney.\n\nNow, her stealthy-chic look could easily fly under the radar, as her navy toggle coat silhouette is a pretty timeless and understated design. But Lawrence allowed her choice of accessories to make a statement. Namely, that bold choice of handbag—a leopard-printed shoulder style by Prada. The luxurious calf hair style, punctuated with silver hardware, has been her go-to this winter, and it’s easy to understand why: You can pair it with your most basic and utilitarian pieces, and suddenly your entire ensemble feels fresh and elevated.",

[laughs]\n\nBut anyway, I love that dress so much.\n\nOh, an A for effort.\n\nThis is me at the BAFTAs. I played Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nWhen we made the film, we actually thought,\n\nwe'll have to take the first off there,\n\nbecause maybe an audience would think\n\nthere was a sequel coming, that it was Elizabeth Part One,\n\nbut it was Elizabeth I, and I'm glad I'm wearing a slip.\n\nI mean, you just take the slip off,\n\nI guess you could wear that today.\n\nAm I an early adopter of that?\n\nNo, or am I holding something? I have got my glasses on.\n\nOh, this was a dress that Jean Paul Gaultier designed.\n\nMy father-in-law, who's no longer with us,\n\ncalled it an exit dress.\n\nHe said people don't think much when you come into the room,\n\nbut when you leave, they go, wow.\n\nThere was obviously a lot of jewelry Jean Paul Guttier\n\nhad put on the dress, but Cynthia Bach then provided\n\nall of the amazing pieces.\n\nI was playing a psychic in Savannah\n\nin a small film called The Gift with Sam Raimi,\n\nand I had never been to a psychic,\n\nand I got her to do a reading for me,\n\nand she made some predictions, wild predictions.\n\nI'd play a writer who had short hair\n\nwho died for what she believed in, Guavin Guevin.\n\nI played Veronica Guerin,\n\nand she said that I would wear a dress\n\nthat was gonna change my career, and then I wore that.\n\nI don't know if it's changed my career,\n\nbut I'm very pleased I wore it.\n\nOh, bless.\n\nNow, that is my own hair,\n\nand that's just me on a Sunday morning in the pond.\n\nNext, in a little-known film called Lord of the Rings,\n\nplaying Galadriel.\n\nI did have someone I deeply respect say to me,\n\nLook, they're making this weird film in New Zealand,\n\nand they want you to play an elf for three weeks.\n\nYou don't wanna do that, do you?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nAfter the film was over, my husband,\n\nhe's fallen out of the habit,\n\nhe sort of does it to the children now,\n\nbut he used to drag me around by my ears.\n\nIt was playful, and so I told the guys at Weta\n\nwho did all of the prosthetics this,\n\nand they gave me, it was kind of creepy,\n\na chocolate box full of ear tips\n\nthat they'd made to look like chocolates,\n\nand then they bronzed my ears\n\nso I could give 'em to my husband.\n\nThat is me on the set of The Aviator,\n\nwhich Martin Scorsese directed.\n\nI think it's between takes.\n\nI was playing Catherine Hepburn.\n\nOne of the more daunting things I've ever done,\n\nbut when Scorsese asks you to do anything,\n\nI'd be a tree for him.\n\nThat was the first time I worked with the great Sandy Powell\n\non the costumes, and my relationship with costume designers,\n\nI've realized over time,\n\nis really pivotal to creating a character,\n\nand obviously, even before you utter a word,\n\nan audience is gonna start reading your character\n\nby what they wear and how they wear it,\n\nand something that Marty did,\n\nhe liberated me from having to do any imitation of Hepburn.\n\nHe played a lot of those early screwball comedies she did,\n\nand Bringing Up Baby was one of them, so I watched that.\n\nCatherine Hepburn is so raked thin,\n\nand then you don't plan for these things,\n\nand then the film got nominated, and I did,\n\nand so I had to do a lot of red carpets pregnant,\n\nand Donna Karan made me this amazing stretchy dress\n\nthat really celebrated the fact I was pregnant.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is back in 2006 for Vogue.\n\nIt's a very memorable shoot.\n\nTonne Goodman styled it, and Steven Klein shot it.\n\nThe clothes were insane.\n\nI mean, this one was another Galliano.\n\nThe pose was really difficult to hold,\n\nand I learned so much about making a picture working\n\nwith Steven Klein and Tonne on this shoot.\n\nNext.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this was the first time I went to the Met Ball,\n\nand I went with Nicolas Ghesquiere\n\nwhen he was at Balenciaga.\n\nSo we just shot with Irving Penn that day,\n\nand Nicolas had done his take on an Elizabethian garment,\n\nand then we went straight from there,\n\nwe had to do a quick 360 and then show up to the Met Ball.\n\nThe theme was Poiret: King of Fashion.\n\nI mean, I just went to the exhibition\n\nand could have stayed there.\n\nIt's always so great.\n\nI mean, the room is really vibrant, of course,\n\nbut it's always important to remember the exhibition\n\nand the reason why you're there.\n\nOkay, next one. [gasps] There we go.\n\nHere is the photograph that Irving Penn took,\n\nand this was in Penn's studio.\n\nThe taking of the picture was incredibly quick,\n\nbut the sitting and preparing,\n\nit's like I've had the great fortune\n\nof being photographed by Penn and by Avedon.\n\nIt's all about their regard\n\nand knowing when to press the shadow,\n\nand so to be beheld by him was just unforgettable.\n\nThis was the second time I played Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Elizabeth: Golden Age.'\n\nThe costumes were designed by Alexandra Byrne.\n\nI mean, she referenced a lot of haute couture,\n\nand there were a lot of Balenciaga references,\n\nand she made one dress that was so enormous,\n\nI couldn't fit through the doorway of the cathedral\n\nthat we were shooting in. [laughs]\n\nHello, Bob.\n\nI've worked with the great Todd Haynes a couple of times,\n\nand I hope I get to do it a couple of times more.\n\nHe's so fantastic to work with.\n\nI had literally walked off the set\n\nof playing Queen Elizabeth\n\nin Queen Elizabeth: The Golden Age on a Friday, wrapped,\n\nand then had to be on set playing Bob Dylan\n\nin Montreal on Monday.\n\nTodd had divided Bob's persona, Bob, like I know him,\n\nDylan's persona into many different characters,\n\nand the late, great Heath Ledger was one of them,\n\nand Christian Bale. and I played this electric silhouette.\n\nI think he wanted a woman inside this period\n\nof Dylan's musical career.\n\nIt meant that there was a separation between\n\nhow iconic this period and this look of Dylan's was\n\nand the character playing,\n\n'cause you know there's a woman inside that,\n\nbut it was so liberating.\n\nI had fantastic eyebrows and sideburns.\n\nWas that the only time my husband hasn't wanted to kiss me?\n\nOh, this is from Carol, a Todd Haynes film.\n\nI played alongside the wonderful Rooney Mara,\n\nand that coat was a nightmare.\n\nSandy Powell did the costumes again, and once again,\n\nI mean, she can do an enormous,\n\nwe worked together on Cinderella with unbelievable costumes\n\nwith a much bigger budget,\n\nand then we had $2.50 to pull this one together,\n\nand she had two coats, and one was great and stable,\n\nand this one was like a little fragile creature\n\nthat kept falling apart, and I said,\n\nI'm really sorry, Sandy. I think it's that one.\n\nAnd she goes, I know, I knew you were gonna say that.\n\nSo Sandy, the great Sandy Powell,\n\nwas literally behind the car in between every take,\n\n'cause we had to get out, and it was really windy,\n\nand the coat would come apart,\n\nand so she was there in between takes sewing it up.\n\nI felt a responsibility for this for sure,\n\nbecause films like this, up to this point,\n\nweren't really made and certainly not made\n\nin the mainstream, and really,\n\nif anyone comes up to me in the supermarket,\n\nthis is the film that they talk about,\n\nand so it was really, really important to a lot of people.\n\n[gasps] Oh, this is Sarah Burton when she was at McQueen,\n\nand it was the most exquisite piece of embroidery.\n\nThe bottom, you can't really see there,\n\nbut it was all feathers.\n\nso I love that dress so much that then, during COVID,\n\nI presided over the jury in Venice, and there was no time.\n\nAll the ateliers were closed, so I said,\n\nCould I borrow that piece of embroidery again?\n\nAnd then I had a pair of pants and wore it,\n\nbecause I thought, when you have something\n\nso beautiful like that, it's a crime to wear it once.\n\nIt's even more beautiful in person.\n\nThe year I was nominated for Blue Jasmine\n\nat the Golden Globes,\n\nMr. Armani had designed this beautiful preve dress.\n\nIt was an impossible gown,\n\nand you didn't really see the back,\n\nbecause it goes right down to this plunging base.\n\nThe back is bare, and this beautiful lace,\n\nwhich has become quite signature,\n\nI was at on the jury in Cannes,\n\nand I wore it to the opening night,\n\nand I remember people saying to my publicist, [laughs]\n\nOkay, Kate's wearing the-\n\nShe's worn that dress before, as if I didn't know.\n\nOh, really?\n\nAnd I was so pleased to wear it again\n\nbecause I'd loved it so much.\n\n[gasps] Sarah Burton, there she is in Cannes.\n\nSarah made this beautiful, it was like a tuxedo,\n\nbut it was a dress, and had this massive bow on the back,\n\nand it was actually shown on the runway as a jacket,\n\nand she said, why don't I try and turn it into a dress?\n\nAnd so I love that, and I wore that again\n\nto Sarah's final show for McQueen.\n\nHere we are back at the Venice Film Festival,\n\nand this is a Schiaparelli flummery\n\nwhich I'd seen on the runway and absolutely loved\n\nand managed not to poke myself in the eye with it.\n\nThis was an example on Tar\n\nof the character coming to life, really.\n\nThe script by Todd Field was just,\n\nhe didn't change a syllable,\n\nit was so exquisitely wrought and written.\n\nIt was like, how do you make a female conductor look,\n\nsomeone who was in incredibly powerful\n\nand very, very aware of her presence?\n\nAnd so we went for this,\n\nI guess what has been termed quiet luxury look,\n\nreally great tailoring.\n\nI've had a couple of experiences in my life\n\nwhere I've just been so in sync with a director\n\nand a script, and you're lucky if you have one\n\nof those experiences in your life,\n\nbut I've had a handful of them, and I'm so grateful,\n\nand Tar was definitely one of them.\n\nMusic has come back into my life in a really major way,\n\nand that's because of this experience.\n\nHere we are. This is Armani Prive.\n\nThis is the dress that just keeps on giving,\n\nThat was from the current Prive collection, and I said,\n\nLook, I know there's this leftover lace from the dress\n\nthat I'd worn to the Globes all those years before,\n\nand they found an offcut,\n\nand so they made the internal corset out of that offcut.\n\nIt's felt great, and I've since worn it again\n\nwith the actual piece that goes underneath it,\n\nand I wanted to wear it with a T-shirt,\n\nbut Mr. Armani wouldn't let me.\n\nYou gotta respect the maestro, right?\n\n[gasps] Oh, hey. Well this is an oldie but a goodie.\n\nWith my first paycheck as an actor,\n\nI bought an Armani suit, and this is it,\n\nand I wear it wherever I can,\n\nand I think we were there in Milan for a Prive show.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, well, this is at Cannes,\n\nand this is the incomparable Nicolas Ghesquiere.\n\nIt's a particular type of beading,\n\nso the dress is incredibly heavy,\n\nbut such is his mastery that he makes it look so light,\n\nand the shoulders are really big.\n\nIn the hands of someone else, could look really solid,\n\nbut then he's got that beautiful drape,\n\nbut yeah, I can't wait to wear this one again.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThis is Brandon Maxwell.\n\nI'm going to Good Morning America.\n\nLooking so good. Did my own hair and makeup, right?\n\nHave that time in the morning.\n\nI love a Canadian tuxedo, double denim, triple denim,\n\nand this wasn't actually denim, it was more like a velvet,\n\nso it was really comfy and cozy.\n\nOh, once again, this is also for Borderlands,\n\nand I'm obsessed with this Swedish designer.\n\nShe's taken sustainable dressing to a whole new level\n\nand seamed this piece that was a dress all done in spoons.\n\nUnderneath this is kind of a cotton netting\n\ninto which she put the spoons on when you get dressed\n\nand it's backless, and then she put some spoons\n\nonto sort of a suit that I wore\n\nfor the Disclaimer premiere in Toronto for the festival.\n\nI mean, it was a crazy bonkers COVID film that I made.\n\nI really love the films of Jodorowsky,\n\nand there was one film of his\n\nwhere they were all in the desert,\n\nand the character has these incredible fingerless gloves.\n\nI thought it'd be good to have something on your hand\n\nin a close-up.\n\n[gasp] Oh, this is the 2024 Rumours premiere\n\nat the New York Film Festival,\n\nand I'd seen this, and I just thought it was hilarious.\n\nIt's Fiorucci, I think.\n\nI wear those leather pants every Wednesday.\n\nMy favorite pair of leather pants.\n\nYeah, it's a bit my Cousin Itt look.\n\nNot breathable, and don't go near me with a naked flame.\n\nThis is the thing,\n\nwhen you think about re-wearing something, you think,\n\nhow could I wear it?\n\nIt would kind of be cool as a skirt.\n\nBlack Bag.\n\nWorking again with Steven Soderbergh,\n\none of the most stylish filmmakers around,\n\nand Alan Mirojnick, who is one\n\nof the greatest costume designers, and I play a spy,\n\nand the only thing Steven said to me is, I want big hair.\n\nIt's a great film, and really fantastic cast.\n\n[upbeat jazzy music] [pen scratching]\n\nThanks, Vogue.

(She revealed her pregnancy with Elijah at the 2023 Met Gala while wearing Loewe. “I felt kind of vulnerable.

Kloss wore a custom Dior dress. Several months later, they held a larger, star-studded affair at Brush Creek Ranch in Saratoga, Wyoming.

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Care and Feeding is Slate’s parenting advice column. Have a question for Care and Feeding? Submit it here.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy husband and I have a 6-year-old daughter. When she was 2 years old, she was diagnosed with a condition. My husband shared this news with his family, and we got bombarded with conflicting advice from a bunch of relatives, especially his mother who would get upset when we didn’t follow her advice. (It was kind of loony and the opposite of what the actual doctor told us.)\n\nAnd so began a cycle; my husband tells his family something, they start bombarding me with bad advice and sometimes hound me as to why I haven’t acted on it. It happened when our daughter was having trouble sleeping at night, when we were told she was at a low weight percentile for her age, and when she broke her leg.\n\nI find this all very annoying. I’ve talked to my husband about it, and he doesn’t seem to think there’s anything wrong. We can just ignore it because it’s coming from a good place. But he’s not the one that all the advice is primarily aimed at. If I gently ask his mom or some of his relatives to stop, they get upset at me and go to my husband who asks me to leave them alone because they’re not harming anyone. How can I get this to stop? To be clear, none of his relatives are experts in any of these subjects. (And yes, I see the irony in asking for advice on this topic.)\n\n—Tired of Advice\n\nDear Advice,\n\nDon’t worry, I’m not taking your anti-advice stance personally! I hate copious unsolicited advice, especially when it comes from an uninformed point of view.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, moving on to some copious-yet-solicited-advice: Your first step needs to be an appeal to your husband. You and he both know the advice is well-meant, that’s not the issue. It’s the advice’s impact on you—and that’s the framing you need to use with him. Explain that while the suggestions come from a good place, they’re having a deleterious effect on you, and you need him to help run interference for your sake. Make it more about your needs, and less about what his family is doing wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, I would suggest you adopt a “forward all inquires to” approach. For example, let’s say your mother-in-law sends you an article about the latest therapies for the condition and says you should tell your daughter’s doctor about this because it might help. You can reply with, “Mike’s handling all these ideas, you can let him know!” On any subsequent texts, shorten it to “OK, feel free to tell Mike.” There are three benefits to an approach like this. First, it gives you a script for deflecting, which will lessen the emotional quotient you need to spend on crafting replies, and you can use it in texts and in person. Two, you become a far less interesting—if not downright annoying—person to make suggestions to, which might lessen how many come your way. Three, your husband gets to receive and filter all the advice, which will help him see the unreasonable volume of opinions befalling you. Plus, if he thinks any of the ideas have merit, then at least you know the person discussing it with you is a trusted teammate and not a nosey second cousin.

He has shoulder-length hair that he loves … except he refuses to take care of it. We brush it every night before bed and again in the morning. He HATES having his hair brushed so the whole endeavor falls apart every time before we can finish. This means he’s got horrible knots that even with a detangler and a special brush for difficult hair can’t get out. We tell him if he wants long hair, we have to take care of it. We’ve tried giving him ownership of it (he won’t brush it if we don’t do it), picking his detangler, you name it, we’ve tried.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don’t want to cut his hair without his say-so, but taking care of it is a massive fight we go through twice a day and both my husband and I are at our wits’ end. I have waist-length hair that he watches me take care of daily so he understands what it takes, but he’s also 5 and we get that he needs help. But he’s also starting to look like Bam Bam from the ‘90s Flintstones movie. Help!\n\n—Hairy Situation\n\nDear Hairy,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt sounds to me like you’re on the right track; I’m sorry you haven’t been met with more success. I’d first encourage you to consult an occupational therapist. These reactions sound like they are large and persistent, which suggests that there might be some kind of sensory sensitivity going on. If that’s the case, it’s probably legitimately hard for him to withstand this brushing (and not just obstinance). Even if he doesn’t receive a diagnosis, an OT might still be able to consult with you and identify some tactics to deploy.\n\nMeanwhile, have you tried a hair-brushing song? You could play it while you brush to both distract him and help him anticipate how long the chore will take. (My kids benefited from the Elmo teeth brushing song; once we started playing it, there were no more fights against the toothbrush.) You can find many options on YouTube; see if any jive with your son. In fact, maybe it doesn’t have to be about hair brushing at all; maybe you can just offer some high-value screen time. I’m not too proud to use screens as bribery during high-stress events! Knowing that he gets a short screen break might give your son the motivation he needs to grin and bear the brushing. (May I recommend Bluey minisodes or Forky Asks a Question, both on Disney Plus?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf and when tantrums occur, remain dispassionate: “I know it’s hard, but if you can’t brush your hair, then you can’t have long hair. So do you choose to take a breath and let me brush, or do you choose for me to take you to the barber after school?” Those are the choices, and he is faced with that choice each time he starts to fuss, without judgment or a punitive tone. I hope you find a system that works for you all. Good luck!\n\n—Allison\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy husband and I have a 5-year-old son, and we live on the ground floor of an apartment building in a large city.

        "title": "Snow White 2025: The many controversies surrounding Disney’s movie with Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot.",
        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "After what feels like an eternity, Disney’s live-action remake of the 1937 animated classic Snow White is finally hitting U.S. theaters this week. But all signs suggest the film is facing an uphill battle: Between criticisms of political incorrectness and a backlash against the actress playing the titular princess that set the entire internet ablaze two years ago (seriously, how long have they been pushing this movie?), this Snow White has been struggling since its inception. Now, the controversy has reached a boiling point, with a rumored feud between the film’s two leads—West Side Story’s Rachel Zegler and Wonder Woman’s Gal Gadot—and reports rolling in that Disney has drastically pared down the film’s promotion to the point of seemingly hoping no one pays the forthcoming release any attention. It’s a shocking result for a $270 million production, although only time will tell whether there’s a happily ever after in sight.\n\nDon’t be bashful about being unable to follow this particularly cursed rabbit hole; after all, the drama has been impressively sprawling, involving tweets from Zegler, speeches from Gadot, podcast appearances from an actor entirely uninvolved in the production, and even global politics. To lend a helping hand, I present to you a rundown of Snow White’s poisoned apples.\n\nHas this movie always been mired in controversy?\n\nPretty much! Peter Dinklage was one of its first detractors. The beloved actor, who has a common form of dwarfism, had some choice comments about Disney’s decision to adapt Snow White. In January of 2022, when appearing on comedian Marc Maron’s podcast WTF to promote the film Cyrano, Dinklage accused Disney of hypocrisy when the topic of the Snow White adaptation came up, expressing bafflement that the company was proud to announce they had cast a Latina actress as Snow White, but are “still making that fucking backwards story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together.” (The original film has been criticized as ableist in its portrayal of dwarves as childlike.) Dinklage’s message to Disney could be summed up as, to borrow his words: “What the fuck are you doing, man?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney hastily responded in a statement to Good Morning America, saying that it would consult with members of the dwarfism community to take “a different approach with these seven characters” and “to avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film.” Furthermore, the Wrap reported that casting sheets showed that Disney had abandoned the seven dwarves for a nondescript group of “magical creatures.” In the end, as the movie’s official trailer shows, the seven dwarves will appear as animated characters.\n\nThe last time we spoke, you told me that Rachel Zegler had upset a lot of people on TikTok in relation to Snow White, but I don’t remember why. Could you rehash that whole saga?\n\nThe short answer is: Zegler didn’t actually do anything untoward. The fact is, a lot of the negative attention she’s gotten stems from bias: Many stubborn traditionalists were always going to be angry at the actress—who is half Colombian and half Polish—simply for being tapped to portray Disney’s “fairest” princess.\n\nRelated From Slate How a New Disney Princess Managed to Piss Off Both Disney Fans and Conservatives Read More\n\nIt wasn’t until 2023 that Zegler began to catch flak from people beyond the “losers obsessed with maintaining the bloodline purity of cartoon princesses” (as Zegler has so winningly referred to them). That year, a couple of Zegler’s old interview clips resurfaced, garnering her criticism from the other side of the culture war. In 2022, Zegler gave an interview to Extra TV at Disney’s D23 Expo (like Comic-Con, but for Disney titles), in which she noted that their new take on the 1937 classic would reimagine the story to fit our current progressive era. Nothing is necessarily wrong with this sentiment, of course, but people took umbrage with how Zegler expressed it: accusing the story’s prince of stalking the titular princess, calling the romance plot “weird,” and noting that the new version is “really not about the love story at all.” In another 2022 interview, this time with Entertainment Weekly, Zegler admitted that she was terrified of the original as a child and watched the movie for the first time in more than a decade to prepare for her role. She also called the original film “extremely dated” regarding “ideas of women being in roles of power and what a woman is fit for in the world.” Zegler also hinted that the meaning of “fairest of them all” will change to encompass not just fairness of visage, but also of justness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnsurprisingly, fans of the beloved original weren’t jazzed over what they felt were disparaging comments about one of their childhood favorites. Some critical fans declared that Zegler had grossly misinterpreted the film, while others simply didn’t jibe with the idea that the person starring as the princess isn’t a huge fan of the princess’s movie. However, I chalk all of this up to Zegler simply (unfairly) coming off to audiences as unlikeable. Her responses and public persona can register as glib or grating to some. (Perhaps it’s her strong theater-kid energy?) Considering Zegler’s outspokeness on social media (especially regarding political matters), it’s inevitable that she also steps in it from time to time with poorly timed or touchy social media posts. But, overall, she hasn’t done nearly enough to warrant the confusing amount of hate she receives.\n\nAll right, so what else has happened since then?\n\nAn additional political wrinkle has developed. Gadot, who is Israeli and has served in the Israel Defense Forces, has been very outspokenly pro-Israel since the start of the war in Gaza. As recently as a couple of weeks ago, when Gadot was honored at the Anti-Defamation League’s annual summit, she gave a speech accusing pro-Palestine protestors of “celebrating, justifying, and cheering on a massacre of Jews.” Some activist groups have called for a boycott of Snow White due to Gadot’s views.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Zegler has been very openly pro-Palestine, tweeting calls for a “Free Palestine” and supporting relief efforts to bring aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Naturally, rumors have since emerged that the two stars of the film aren’t chummy because of their different political beliefs.\n\nAdditionally, at least as far as domestic politics are concerned, Zegler has landed in hot water with Donald Trump supporters (and the unfortunately culturally immortal Megyn Kelly) after posting an impassioned anti-Trump message to her Instagram Stories following the 2024 election. In it, Zegler finished her lambaste of Trump with: “May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace.” She was later forced to apologize, writing, “I let my emotions get the best of me.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsually drama between actors feels engineered in order to promote the movie, but this definitely feels different. How has Disney reacted to this growing controversy in the promotional run for the movie?\n\nDisney said “Heigh-ho!” and practically took a sledgehammer to the promotional plan for Snow White’s premiere. Before a European promotional event on March 12—held at a castle in Segovia, Spain, rather than the usual U.K. red carpet—Variety reported that Disney would also be hosting a “scaled-back” Hollywood premiere, but the studio wouldn’t “be rolling out a robust red carpet” like usual. The only red-carpet interviewers allowed turned out to be those “employed by Disney,” and there was a “a smaller-than-usual assembly of photographers,” Variety reported following the March 15 event. (In a quote obtained by the Hollywood Reporter prior to the Hollywood premiere, Disney’s explanation for the low-key rollout is that they decided to mount a “more celebratory, family-friendly afternoon event to match the tone and target audience for the film.”)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, according to theater owners interviewed by THR, Disney didn’t make advance ticket sales available for purchase until less than two weeks prior to the film’s release—a truncated timeline, considering Disney usually opens up advance ticket sales a month or so before a title hits theaters.\n\nRelated From Slate This Has to Be One of the Most Devastating Plots to Unfold in a Marvel Project Read More\n\nHave the two leads done any press together for the movie?\n\nCertainly! Though it’s worth noting that Gadot and Zegler have kept to the safer promotional appearances so far. Whatever the leads’ personal feelings are towards each other (rumored or otherwise), it didn’t stop them from presenting an award together at the Oscars just a couple of weeks ago. The cast will also likely sit through press junkets in the coming week, though it’s unclear who will appear in interviews with whom. And, while Zegler has been performing overseas in Japan and Spain, Gadot has done a short circuit of talk shows including Good Morning America and The Tonight Show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan we conclude that this whole saga is not going to have a happy ending?\n\nSafe to say, this is an anticlimactic rollout for a $270 million investment ($450 million, if you include prints and advertising costs, according to Vulture). But it’s not surprising that Disney doesn’t know what to do with the maelstrom of troublesome headlines that this production has produced. At this point, the movie isn’t plagued by a poisoned apple, but a poisoned orchard. However, the real test of how detrimental this whole situation has been will take place at the box office, where the industry is waiting to see if Disney’s name and ongoing nostalgia project have enough cachet to bring in the ticket sales needed to keep Snow White from flopping. (Sources have apparently warned Vulture about the Mouse’s declining prestige as it struggles to churn out the lucrative hit pictures it used to.) While Disney wishes upon a star that Snow White will sing, the only thing left to do is wait and see.",

        "content": "When he got his first glimpse of a movie studio, Orson Welles excitedly proclaimed it “the biggest electric train set any boy ever had.” But with a reported budget of more than $300 million, Joe and Anthony Russo’s The Electric State makes Welles’ train set look like a busted caboose. The most expensive movie in Netflix’s history, it’s also among the costliest of all time, joining a list that includes the brothers’ own Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. If the Russos are the most profligate creators in history—their Amazon series Citadel is also one of the most expensive TV shows ever made—they’re among the most successful too. Endgame and Infinity War grossed nearly $5 billion in movie theaters alone. And yet for all the money they’re making, and all that they’re allowed to spend, they don’t seem to be enjoying themselves very much.\n\nThe Electric State certainly wants you to think you’re having a good time. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who, with the exception of the typographically doomed Cherry, have written all of the Russos’ movies since 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, populate their world—an alternate mid-1990s in which labor-saving robots have been a fact of life for nearly four decades—with a range of quirky machines, from animatronic popcorn buckets to a chatty barbershop chair that keeps pestering Chris Pratt’s shaggy metalhead to submit to a haircut. Although the story is set mostly in the aftermath of a war between humanity and robots that cost countless lives, the tone is consistently, even aggressively, chipper. (Humans themselves generally stay at home, puppeteering mechanized exoskeletons they can manipulate from afar through a primitive version of the internet.) Every character speaks in the same quippy, sarcastic patter, and their jokes are double-underlined, first by another character’s shocked response, then by the original speaker’s smug Yeah, I said that smirk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Why Netflix’s Most Expensive Movies Keep Getting Worse Read More\n\nA common complaint with modern megabudget movies is that it’s impossible to tell where the money went. Watching the Russos’ nondescript Netflix action thriller The Gray Man, for example, it’s easy to look at its washed-out colors and uninspired set pieces and think, $200 million for that? The Electric State at least looks expensive. Much of the story takes place in the Ex, an arid chunk of the American Southwest that has been turned into a reservation for the defeated robot survivors, where hundreds of intricately designed and meticulously realized sentient devices have gathered in an abandoned shopping mall. There are massive battles in which cars collide with skyscrapers several stories up, and belowground there’s a cavernous lair filled with black-market memorabilia. (In the post-conflict ’90s, G.I. Joe lunch boxes have suddenly become valuable contraband.) And yet the movie suffers from a constant lack, not of resources but of imagination, of inspiration—of, to put it simply, fun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are plenty of things in The Electric State that ought to be fun, like the revelation that the robot uprising’s leader was a familiar commercial mascot, a human-sized legume with a top hat and monocle. But when we’re informed that “Mr. Peanut signed the treaty of surrender with President Clinton,” there’s no wink at the underlying absurdity, just a flat recitation of fact. In the movie’s reality, self-governing robots were first realized by Walt Disney in 1955 as a theme-park attraction, and they retain an element of midcentury kitsch, but we never get a chance to linger on the darkly humorous implication that untold thousands of human soldiers must have met death at the hands of an ambulatory doughnut or homicidal pay phone. The story cries out for some of Paul Verhoeven’s consumerist satire, but instead the Russos have chosen to play it as Spielberg—or, more specifically, like the cut-rate Spielberg imitations that clogged multiplexes in the 1980s after E.T.’s runaway success had the studios scrambling to keep up. Its villains, a monomaniac tech mogul (Stanley Tucci) and a bloodthirsty general (Giancarlo Esposito), are like a child’s imagined version of what their parents do at work, inhabiting vacant, generic spaces that tell us nothing about who they are or what they represent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor most of The Electric State, we’re stuck following Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown), a rebellious teenage foster kid who lost her entire family in a car crash just before the war. For reasons Markus and McFeely’s script can’t be bothered to explain, Michelle becomes convinced that her younger brother somehow survived the accident and is remotely controlling the movements of a robot named Cosmo, a grinning, metallic humanoid with a Bob’s Big Boy pompadour, who clanks his way into her backyard one night. This ought to entail a massive leap of faith, one made even more daunting by the fact that Cosmo speaks only in catchphrases gleaned from a children’s TV show. But the Russos don’t seem to care about a young girl wrestling with the idea that the brother she’s mourned for years might still be alive, so they simply skip past the emotional deadweight and move on to the next eye-catching spectacle. The beats of a Russo brothers movie are so predetermined they don’t bear lingering on, but The Electric State might be the first time they’ve opted to just skip over them altogether.\n\nFor as much as it owes to the Spielberg movies of the ’80s, The Electric State is most directly indebted to Ready Player One, which likewise takes place in a world built of pop-cultural discards and conglomerated intellectual property. But as much film-geek fun as Spielberg had rummaging through the Warner Bros. vault, he at least realized he was creating a dystopia. The Russos don’t see anything viscerally wrong with a world built entirely out of other people’s creations, because that’s how they make movies, bringing nothing of their own but a saw and a bucket of glue. (There’s nothing wrong with pastiche, but you still have to contribute something original.) It doesn’t occur to them that giving the defeated robot army’s military commander a courtly Southern drawl (courtesy of Matthew McConaughey) evokes Confederate nostalgia, any more than they can process the contradiction in putting Captain America at the heart of a ’70s-style paranoid thriller, because they’re just stripping the past for parts. As the music swells at the climax of The Electric State, you start to notice a familiar melody creeping into the underscore, and then you realize: It’s just “Wonderwall.” Why write your own tune when you can buy one from Oasis?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russos are pushing the boundaries of the film industry’s economics, if nothing else. But they’re branch managers at heart, at their peak when they’re enthusiastically carrying out directives from the head office. Their Marvel movies draw on decades’ worth of comic-book storylines, dreamed up by people whose names are saved for the end-credits crawl, and they put just enough spin on familiar conventions to make audiences feel as if they’re seeing them anew (although, in truth, it’s their inevitability that makes them feel satisfying). But when they have to make something of their own, for a company that now seems content to simply copy whatever’s already popular, it’s almost awe-inspiring how little they come up with. They’ve got the coolest toys imaginable, and all they can think to do is follow the instructions.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nWhen Mary Harris got Talking Points Memo founder Josh Marshall on the phone on Sunday, she had one simple question for him: Do you think the government should be open right now?\n\nHis answer was no—that Senate Democrats should have taken a stand against Donald Trump’s lawlessness and withheld the votes Republicans needed to keep the government from shutting down. Even one single Democrat could have made more of a stink and slowed things down.\n\nNow, for better or worse, the government is open—but the struggle within the party over how to handle a potential shutdown revealed divisions that may be with us for quite some time. On Monday’s episode of What Next, Harris spoke with Marshall about the mindset that led Democrats to give up a rare moment of leverage.\n\nHere’s their conversation, lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nTell me what happened in the House, where this legislation began. We have this GOP-crafted bill. Democrats weren’t consulted on any of it, basically.\n\nYeah, by design, they weren’t consulted on it. There was some initial negotiation. And Democrats basically said, look, if we are going to pass this kind of mini stopgap budget bill, we need some assurances that Donald Trump is not going to turn around and just cut the budget after we pass it. Mike Johnson realized that was a total nonstarter for Donald Trump to put any limitations on his power, so they just said: Fine, we’re just going to do this ourselves. And they included a number of additional things that, under normal circumstances, would be poison pills for the Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this stuff like slashing Washington, D.C.’s budget, things like that?\n\nSlashing Washington, D.C.’s budget. It added a lot of additional spending for things Republican support. Cuts for things that Democrats support. There’s sort of too many things to get into.\n\nBut just as one example: Everybody knows that Donald Trump is imposing tariffs, un-imposing them, imposing bigger ones the next day. We’ve been doing this for the last month with these tariffs. Some people, because of that, get the idea that tariffs are like a pardon—one of these things that are just in the president’s power, the Constitution gives him that power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTariffs are not like that at all. The president has no power over tariffs whatsoever. But there is standing legislation that has been in place for decades that basically gives presidents this power. And so in this bill, they put in additional language that takes away some of Congress’ very, very limited power under current law to say no to some of these tariffs.\n\nSo this is not what’s called, usually, a “clean CR,” where it’s just, we’re saying: We’re going to do what we said we’d do for a few months and come back and talk about it later. This is: Let’s give a lot more power to Donald Trump, but say that we’re just doing it as a funding bill. Is that a fair assessment?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExactly. It’s nowhere near clean. A “clean CR”—a little code word they use for these kinds of bills—is one sentence. And this was like a 100-page bill. So yeah, it was not even close to being just a continuation.\n\nSo Hakeem Jeffries, the leader of the Democrats in the House, got a lot of his Democrats to vote against this bill, including Democrats in swing districts who were pretty vulnerable. It goes along to the Senate. Was he expecting the Senate would stand up here? Was there an agreement here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow it is being presented now—how a lot of House Democrats are presenting this—is kind of what you’re getting at: That they went out on a limb and then the Senate didn’t back them up. I think that’s part of the story. I’m not sure it’s completely the story.\n\nThere’s an expectation, but maybe not an agreement.\n\nI think they were all caught off guard by being here. And I think the House decided to hold the line, and then it’s going to go to the Senate and we’ll see what happens there.\n\nThe House is notably a much more vulnerable constituency of lawmakers. These are people who are up for election every two years. Unlike the Senate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrecisely. And I think that the key thing here is that neither House nor Senate Democrats had laid the groundwork, if this was going to be a fight. And that was something that a lot of people were telling them to do. Like basically, a month ago, you need to be saying: You’re doing all this illegal cutting. You think you can do it now, but we say no—and look at that deadline coming up, we’re doing it for X, Y, and Z. But they didn’t do that. And they had a sort of explanation why they didn’t do that, but they didn’t. And the Senate Democrats were especially caught flat-footed because they were figuring it wouldn’t get out of the House. And there were some good reasons to think it wasn’t going to get out of the House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you’ve gotta be prepared when the ball comes to you, my friend.\n\nIt is insane that they hadn’t seriously thought through what they would do if it did get through the House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this legislation reaches the Senate. We have this weird week where you have, first, Schumer being like, We’re not going to do it. And then it’s clear: Eh, maybe we’re going to do this, help the Republicans out here. And it all comes to a head on Friday, which is when this thing has to get done or the government will shut down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat surprised you as these votes started to come in? I think people suspected that this CR was going to get passed by the Senate—but then we had people like Hawaii’s Brian Schatz voting for this CR, and that surprised me. He’s been outspoken about using these spending fights as points of leverage because the Democrats need to show that we’re fighting right now. And that’s not what he did here.\n\nYeah, he is sort of the biggest mystery. I was greatly surprised by that, for exactly the reasons you’re saying, and I still have not seen a clear explanation of why he did it. He’s a fairly progressive senator. He’s definitely someone who he spends time in the online political spaces, he sort of speaks that language. A number of the senators who voted yes were either people who are retiring or people who are extremely close to the leadership. Gillibrand obviously is the junior senator from New York, so she’s kind of always going to take Chuck Schumer’s lead. Basically almost everybody who voted yes has a similar kind of profile in the Senate, and Schatz was the big exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan we take seriously the arguments Democrats were making against shutting down the government and for this continuing resolution? Because Chuck Schumer did try to explain his logic here. He mostly seemed to be saying: If we shut the government down, Donald Trump is going to have power to control spending, for whatever money is left. He could just start shutting all sorts of things down willy-nilly, which would be incredibly damaging. Is that the main argument here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think there’s two arguments. One is that you shut the government down and the Democrats will get the blame for it—a political argument. And the other is that, as bad as things are right now, you’re just sort of handing him a blank check. I think those two arguments were real arguments. I don’t think they were good arguments.\n\nBut there’s an additional factor, which is: What is the argument that we were actually going to get something from it? And if you take each of those premises—like we could be damaged politically, the government could be damaged more than it already is being damaged, and there’s no way we can actually gain anything—well, again, if you buy those premises, then that’s not a bad argument altogether. I don’t think that the people who wanted to do this were lying. I think that characterologically, they weren’t in a mood to fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, because I think you could take the same set of facts and you could make a different argument, which is an argument I’d call an accelerationist argument. Essentially that, yes, Trump and Elon Musk may do worse things during this shutdown, but that will make clear to a broader swath of Americans exactly the project that they are trying to complete here, sooner. And that will make it easier for us to argue against them and control them more quickly. Now, you’re playing with fire—there’s a reason it’s called an accelerationist argument, right? But I think it’s a real argument that you need to reckon with.\n\nYeah, and I think it is actually the correct argument. I wouldn’t put it in precisely accelerationist terms. How I would put it is: In terms of the idea that they can just do anything they want and they can do even more—it’s not entirely clear that is actually factually true, inasmuch as that they’re kind of already doing everything they want. But public opinion remains a backstop to that. And one of my kind of global arguments would be that the people who did not want to fight about this are very over-literal about things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nI think that much of national politics is not about specific events or policies. It’s about a series of contests of performative power. It’s sort of like, if anybody is familiar with opera, there’s the libretto and there’s the score. The libretto is the policy stuff, and these little ins and outs about cloture and stuff. And the libretto, you know—I’m gonna bum out libretto fans—the libretto is not really what opera is about. It’s the score. That is the emotional content and the real driving force of opera. And the score in this case is, again, these performative displays of power. And if you have situations where the underdogs—let’s call them that—if the one opening they have to fight, they don’t fight, that shapes everybody’s perceptions of everything.\n\nLike whether they even can fight.\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nSo you’re saying your job, if you’re a politician, is to tell people they can fight, they have a voice.\n\nAnd that your fighting can shape outcomes. Even if the details are hard to see.",

        "content": "The following essay is based on Clay Risen’s new book Red Scare: Blacklists, McCarthyism, and the Making of Modern America, out from Scribner on March 18.\n\nOn April 28, 1948, a physicist named Edward U. Condon took the lectern at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Washington. If not as famous as his former boss at the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Condon was held in nearly equal esteem by his scientific colleagues: A pioneering figure in nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, and radar before World War II, he was now director of the Bureau of Standards, the forerunner to today’s National Institute of Standards and Technology, where he was helping construct the federal government’s sprawling research infrastructure, an astounding outpouring of public resources that would lead to everything from GPS and the internet to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBut Condon’s speech that day was focused on a dark vision about America’s future. “There is growing in this country a wave of anti-intellectualism which is violently opposed to free speech and free expression,” he said. Thousands of government scientists, economists, and other experts were being investigated, and in many cases fired, in the name of anti-communism and national security—a campaign that Condon compared to ideological purges by the Nazis in the early days of the Third Reich.\n\n“The last decade alone provides for us too many examples of nations where the people ignored the symptoms of totalitarianism until it was too late,” he warned. “Anti-intellectualism precedes the totalitarian putsch, and anti-intellectualism is on the upswing here.”\n\nSlate receives a commission when you purchase items using the links on this page. Thank you for your support.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs his audience undoubtedly knew, Condon spoke from painful personal experience. A year earlier, Rep. J. Parnell Thomas, the chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, had begun a sustained campaign against him, first in magazine articles, then in a March 1948 report that called him “one of the weakest links in our atomic security” and accused him of “knowingly or unknowingly” maintaining ties to Soviet spies. In Thomas’ telling, Condon was part of a cabal of liberal, technocratic elites who ran the inner workings of the federal government and, out of naivete or treachery, were now fatally undermining their country in the face of the Soviet threat.\n\nThomas’ attacks were baseless, and both Condon and his boss, Secretary of Commerce W. Averell Harriman, resisted them. But the assault continued, and in 1951 Condon decided he had had enough. He quit the Bureau of Standards to take a job in the private sector. Still the attacks came: In 1954, when his employer, Corning Glass Works, submitted a bid for him to work on a sensitive military project, the Navy revoked his security clearance. (This also reportedly came at the urging of Vice President Richard Nixon, who wanted to undermine Harriman, who was running for governor of New York.) Rather than continue fighting, Condon left his job at Corning and spent the rest of his career teaching.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Condon Affair, as it was known, has been largely forgotten. But it bears all the hallmarks of the worst of the Red Scare era: knee-jerk anti-intellectualism; a baseless conviction that an elite, anti-American conspiracy was pulling the strings in Washington; and a willingness to abuse the levers of political power with little foresight about the unintended consequences. As Donald Trump and Elon Musk attempt to dismantle the federal government in the name of rooting out the so-called deep state and the supposed horrors of “woke,” they are drawing on a line of thinking that has long animated the Republican hard right. It goes back to the founding of the modern federal bureaucracy in the 1930s. Far from being a new phenomenon, paranoid anti-elitism in America has a long and surprising pedigree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Red Scare was about many things, but broadly speaking, it arose from the intersection of two powerful impulses that coursed through American society after World War II. One was a backlash to the massive federal intervention of the New Deal. The other was the sudden, terrifying onset of the Cold War, with its prospects for a nuclear-tipped global conflict. Together, these impulses unleashed an unprecedented period of political hysteria about the hidden motives of government officials—which led to the blacklists, loyalty tests, and witch hunts that defined the era, most famously under Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great Depression had shocked millions of Americans into action. Between 1929 and 1933, nearly 9,000 banks failed, manufacturing output dropped by 30 percent, and a quarter of all workers had been left unemployed. In response, a new spirit of political engagement swept across the country, much of it rallying to the vision of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His domestic agenda delivered hundreds of thousands of public jobs, billions of dollars in economic support, and above all, a “New Deal” for the American people, asserting the power of the government to create guardrails around the economy.\n\nThe combination of the Great Depression and the New Deal, wrote the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., had “made men of intellectual ability available as never before; and the government had never been so eager to hire them.” The writer Sherwood Anderson, visiting the capital in 1933, encountered several old acquaintances at the Department of Agriculture: “I stood there in the office a few minutes and at least ten of my old western friends came in, old radicals, young ones, newspaper men etc. … There is certainly a curious exhilarating feeling.”\n\nThe bureaucratic influx was thick with graduates of the nation’s best universities. Rexford Tugwell, Felix Frankfurter, Adolf Berle—acolytes of the brain trust that encircled the president—were plucked from schools like Columbia and Harvard. “Unless an applicant can murder the broad A and present a Harvard sheepskin, he is definitely out,” complained one Michigan congressman, a bit of hyperbole about the new government elite that nevertheless revealed some truth about the high intellectual character of the expanding federal bureaucracy. Another called the New Deal a “Phi Beta Kappa Tammany Hall.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven as many Americans banded together around Roosevelt and the New Deal, anger was brewing. Employers resented Roosevelt’s pro-labor stance, as well as his fighting words attacking “economic royalists.” Farmers appreciated government support but hated being told when and what to plant. Southern politicians loved the outpouring of federal aid but detested the possibility that those funds might benefit Black neighborhoods. And all of them loathed the hundreds of thousands of government regulators brought in to operate an alphabet soup of new federal agencies.\n\nThe impression that the New Deal was being run by the East Coast elite fed into conservative attacks on the Roosevelt administration as un-American. Later generations would call it the “deep state,” but the suspicion was the same: that underneath the layers of elected officials and public figures who supposedly ran the government lay the real power, a vast cadre of anonymous bureaucrats.\n\nConservatives accused these bureaucrats of answering to some foreign nation or ideology. One Republican congressman from Pennsylvania said the president’s National Industrial Recovery Act “Russianizes the business of America.” In 1934 Hamilton Fish, who represented Roosevelt’s home district in New York’s Hudson Valley, said, “This administration has copied the autocratic tactics of fascism, Hitlerism and communism at their worst.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis conflict between New Deal progressives and anti-Roosevelt conservatives hummed on the edges of the 1930s and the war years of the early 1940s. But it took on a new, frightening resonance with the onset of the Cold War, as the Soviet Union replaced Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan as America’s main enemy. The Cold War was an ideological battle; it would, many argued, necessitate an unblinking effort to root out domestic subversion and dissent. Spies were obviously a threat, but so too were those who advocated for, sympathized with, or even merely tolerated political beliefs that might offer an opening to communism at home. Sleepless diligence had been the watchword of the previous war; now that paranoia turned inward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1947 President Harry S. Truman instituted a loyalty program requiring every federal employee to be screened for possible “membership in, affiliation with or sympathetic association” with one of the more than two dozen organizations deemed “subversive” by the attorney general. Affiliation could mean anything: a few dollars into a collection plate at a rally, a name absent-mindedly scribbled on a petition, an innocent friendship with the wrong sort of person—all were now considered in the worst possible light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was every reason for the government to worry about Soviet espionage, and even Condon, in his speech to the American Physical Society, praised Truman’s loyalty program. But as Condon also pointed out, the rush to absolute security was emboldening conspiracists and anti–New Deal Republicans who had spent the past decade shouting into the void about communist subversion. Suddenly they had a ready audience who may not have always believed their accusations but was now unwilling to stand in their way as they charged through liberal bastions—Hollywood, Washington, schools, civil rights groups, and unions—looking for evidence to support their allegations.\n\nSuch hunts easily spilled over into attacks against everything Roosevelt had built. During his 1946 Senate campaign, McCarthy—then a small-time Wisconsin judge—ran an ad asking, “Tired of being pushed around? Do you like to have some government bureaucrat tell you how to manage your life? … Who’s to blame for all this? Nobody but the New Deal.” He won his race handily. By 1953 the Chicago Tribune, the largest-circulation newspaper in the Midwest and the country’s leading voice of the right, was openly railing against the “Communist-controlled New Deal.”\n\nScientists, especially physicists, came in for particular attention. On the one hand, their contributions to stunning wartime technological breakthroughs—radar, sonar, rocketry, and above all the atomic bomb—had transformed them into an intellectual clerisy, holding the keys to the nation’s future. On the other hand, many of them subscribed to the progressive politics of the New Deal era, contributing money and prestige to left-wing causes that, a decade later, made them suspect in the eyes of Red Scare vigilantes. Condon, who had stayed largely apolitical during the 1930s, was outspoken in his belief in civilian control over nuclear power; even this belief was treated like a prelude to subversion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn theory, there were legitimate concerns. Where to draw the line between security and intellectual freedom, between diversity of ideas and unity of purpose? In practice, the concerns became excuses for wholesale attacks on America’s technocratic elite, at a time when the country needed strong intellectual leadership. Nebraska Sen. Hugh Butler, a close ally of McCarthy, summed up the attitude in a 1950 speech against Dean Acheson, Truman’s patrician secretary of state: “I look at that fellow, I watch his smart-aleck manner and his British clothes and that New Dealism in everything he says and does, and I want to shout, ‘Get out! Get Out! You stand for everything that has been wrong in the United States for years!’ ”\n\nIn a 1964 article in Harper’s, the historian Richard Hofstadter outlined what he called “the paranoid style” in American politics. Witch hunts and conspiracy theories had a long history, he said, going back to 17th-century Salem and the 19th-century Know Nothings. “But the modern right wing … feels dispossessed: America has been largely taken away from them and their kind,” Hofstadter wrote. “Their predecessors discovered foreign conspiracies; the modern radical right finds that conspiracy also embraces betrayal at home.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time Hofstadter wrote that, the Red Scare had subsided, its loudest voices pushed to the fringe of U.S. politics. But the animating spirit remained, ready to be exhumed by future generations of conspiracists and political opportunists.\n\nNow, 70 years later, we are seeing another frightening revival. This time the alleged enemy is not Soviet communism but “woke” ideology and DEI policies. In both cases, the primary targets have been the rank and file of the vast federal workforce, especially the seasoned lawyers, scientists, and policy experts who make and direct critical decisions affecting everyone in this country. As was the case with Condon, they have been accused, often without evidence, of being beholden to an anti-American ideology—Trump calls it “illegal” and “evil.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is too early to say which moment of empowered anti-government hysteria will have the more lasting impact. During the Red Scare, thousands of workers saw their lives pulled apart by FBI investigations; hundreds lost their jobs and even went to prison. But the nation also came to its senses, and by the mid-1950s the Red Scare had effectively ended. Today, two generations later, thousands have already lost their jobs, though the courts have yet to determine how extensive those cuts can be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat the Trump administration was voted into office to enact a reactionary agenda just a few years after a series of heroic but invasive governmental interventions halted the deadly spread of COVID-19 is not a coincidence. Though hundreds of millions of lives were saved by the fast-tracked vaccine and lockdowns, the implementation of various protocols was swift, alarming, and, to many thousands of people, overzealous. School closures caused students to fall behind in school. Unemployment rates spiked. Conspiracy theories, especially about vaccines, spread like wildfire.\n\nRelated From Slate Tying Black Resistance to Communism Is a Time-Tested American Tradition Read More\n\nIn other words, the backlash created an ideal political climate for anti-intellectual extremists like Musk and Trump to take power.\n\nThe real question is how it ends, if at all. The centrist establishment—not just in politics, but in the media, business, and civil society—is much weaker today than it was in the 1950s. Anti-government sentiment remains widespread and visceral. Anti-intellectualism and a hostility toward federal bureaucracy pervade every corner of the Trump administration. The chances of one, two, many Edward Condons to come remains a frightening possibility.\n\nCondon himself did live to see a reemergence of trust in the federal government, at least for a time. After leaving Corning, he went to teach at Washington University, then the University of Colorado.\n\nIn the mid-1960s he was put in charge of a comprehensive review of UFO sightings, funded by the U.S. Air Force, a sure sign that the government no longer considered him a dangerous figure. In 1968 he authored the project’s final report. “Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge,” he wrote—in other words, that these sightings were complete bunk. So were allegations of government cover-ups: “What has been miscalled secrecy has been no more than an intelligent policy of delay in releasing data so that the public does not become confused by premature publication of incomplete studies of reports.”\n\nIt was, finally, one conspiracy theory that Condon was able to bring to an end—at least for the time being.",

Trump has already eliminated Congress as an independent lawmaking body by reducing the Republican Party—which holds majorities in both houses—to a band of quaking sycophants. In the executive branch, by declaring himself the sole authoritative interpreter of law and systematically firing anyone who dissents or indeed might do so, he has made the Führerprinzip the rule of legal decision.\n\nAt present, all eyes are on the federal judiciary as it considers challenges by state and local governments and private actors to the Trump administration’s many illegal initiatives. The conventional thinking is that judges are the last line of defense and that if the courts acquiesce in Trump’s grab for dictatorial power or if Trump simply defies judicial orders, as he may have begun to do over the weekend, Trump’s triumph will be complete.\n\nThe federal judiciary is certainly key, but it is a mistake to view judges in isolation. The true obstacle between Trump and dictatorship is not the judges alone but the entire legal system and the legal profession—judges and lawyers.\n\nThe law and lawyers handed Trump his biggest setbacks in his first term. Lawyers persuaded judges to block some of Trump’s worst executive actions. Lawyers also persuaded judges to reject Trump’s phony claims that the 2020 election was rigged. Less appreciated but equally important were the principled lawyers inside the federal government who provided honest legal guidance and repeatedly refused to carry out illegal orders.\n\nThis time around, Trump is taking aim at the entire legal profession. He and his lackeys denigrate judges and may have begun to openly defy the courts. He is firing or attempting to cow honest lawyers within the executive branch. Simultaneously, he is trying to intimidate lawyers in private practice—beginning with prominent firms like Perkins Coie, Covington & Burling, and Paul Weiss—who have opposed him before or might now take cases against him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe legal profession as a whole must fight back. It has tools to do so, if it will use them. Consider how the profession can deal with government lawyers who have enlisted in Trump’s assault on the rule of law.\n\nThere are three key points:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, Trump needs a large cadre of government lawyers to align with him. He needs them now to defend particular maneuvers in his attack on constitutional order. And if he succeeds in transforming America into a de facto dictatorship, he will need lawyers to staff the remaining Potemkin legal system. All modern dictatorships have maintained the forms of law as legitimizing cover for totalitarian criminality—Hitler’s Germany, the Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of China.\n\nSecond, law is an oath-bound, self-regulating profession. You cannot practice any kind of law anywhere in the United States—whether giving contract advice to a local hair salon or representing the U.S. in federal court—unless you are admitted to the bar of at least one state and take an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Admission to state bars is controlled by the profession through varying cooperative arrangements between state courts and state bar associations. Likewise, each state has procedures for disciplining admitted members who have violated the law or professional ethical standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThird, federal judges control who can practice in their courts, both by establishing general qualifications for admission and by enforcing disciplinary processes for lawyers who violate the law or professional ethics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will always be some lawyers willing to do an autocrat’s bidding, principally fools, cowards, unprincipled careerists, and some sincere, committed fascists. There will also be some who don’t quite fit those categories but who will convince themselves that their professional obligation to represent clients zealously extends to bending or obscuring facts or advancing legal theories they privately think outlandish and dangerous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, the adversary character of our legal system, with its attendant commitment of lawyers to zealous representation, complicates the suggestion that the legal profession take affirmative steps against government lawyers acting on behalf of even an aggressively authoritarian regime. However, there are, in my view, limits beyond which a government lawyer ought not go, and also limits beyond which a government lawyer absolutely may not go.\n\nAs to the first, government lawyers ought not advance positions that, even if arguably defensible upon strained readings of the Constitution and laws, plainly tend to undermine the basic structure and protections of American constitutionalism. Although government lawyers who espouse such theories should not be, on those grounds, subject to professional discipline, they can—and, I think, should—generally be shunned by the profession. Lawyers who take this road should know that once the Trump era ends, their professional paths will be rocky and they will not be welcomed back into the fraternity of those who believe in the rule of law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore concrete measures are available where government lawyers violate the law or ethical rules. But persuading judges and the bar to use them requires people trained to hesitant moderation to recognize the dire, unprecedented challenges the country faces.\n\nConsider as an example the behavior of acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove in seeking dismissal of the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. The Biden Justice Department indicted Adams for public corruption, Adams cozied up to Trump, including shifting his public position on immigration enforcement, and once Trump was in office, Bove ordered the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office to dismiss all charges against Adams without prejudice. Bove’s letter justified the dismissal on the grounds that Adams’ indictment and impending trial would affect the mayor’s “ability to support” federal efforts to stem “unlawful mass migration and resettlement.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritically, the proposed dismissal without prejudice would give the Trump administration continuing leverage over Adams on immigration enforcement and, indeed, on any other question. Should Adams fail to please the president, new charges could be refiled.\n\nOn Feb. 13, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, resigned rather than dismiss the case. In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Sassoon characterized Bove’s proposed resolution of the case as an improper “bargain.” Six other Southern District of New York federal prosecutors resigned rather than acquiesce to taking part in Bove’s deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBove then transferred the case to DOJ’s Public Integrity Section, in Washington. The acting head of that section and three other senior section attorneys refused to drop the Adams charges and resigned. The following day, on a video call with remaining section prosecutors, Bove demanded that someone sign the dismissal request within an hour. One senior lawyer did, believing that doing so would save the jobs of the others. As it proved, this sacrifice was in vain. On Tuesday, the Public Integrity Section—the hub of federal anti-corruption prosecutions—was disbanded as a litigating unit.\n\nIn sum, 11 federal prosecutors resigned rather than sign on to Bove’s bargain, and an entire section of the Justice Department was demolished in the wake of its reluctance to do so.\n\nBove’s bargain is a violation of prosecutorial ethics. The American Bar Association’s Standards of the Prosecution Function (Standard 3-4.4) prohibit the exercise of prosecutorial discretion based on “partisan or other improper political … considerations.” And as Sassoon’s letter pointed out, the DOJ’s own Principles of Federal Prosecution (Section 9-27.260) prohibit initiating or declining charges based on a defendant’s “political association, activities, or beliefs.” Moreover, there is an arguable case that the Adams dismissal agreement is a form of criminal bribery under 18 USC Section 201(b)(2).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudge Dale E. Ho is now considering whether to grant Bove’s motion to dismiss Adams’ case without prejudice under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48. Ho appointed outside counsel, Paul Clement, to brief the question.\n\nClement’s brief notes that although the court can deny a motion to dismiss, it cannot force the DOJ to prosecute a case. Therefore, he recommends that the judge dismiss the case, but with prejudice, thus eliminating the feature granting Trump future leverage over the mayor.\n\nThis is a perfectly adequate lawyerly recommendation on the narrow question of how to resolve the motion to dismiss. But Clement goes further, recommending against holding any evidentiary hearing to establish the truth of conflicting factual claims between Bove and the prosecutors who resigned because, says Clement, the essential nature of the conflicting positions is already plain. Here Clement totally misses the boat by either misunderstanding or choosing to ignore the stakes in this case.\n\nThe disputed factual issue is not some trifling misunderstanding between prosecutors and defense counsel over minor terms of a plea agreement, nor is it about a legitimate policy disagreement within layers of the Justice Department hierarchy. Rather, multiple senior federal prosecutors in New York and Washington have expressly, in carefully worded written declarations, or implicitly, through the drastic step of resignation, accused the second-ranking DOJ official of politically tainted, professionally unethical, possibly criminal conduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritically, Ho cannot rely on the established tradition of DOJ independence of the president or the derivative presumption that the department’s lawyers are fundamentally honest and that any serious allegation of professional impropriety will be promptly addressed by internal ethics mechanisms or, in a case involving potential criminality, by appointment of a special counsel. The reality is that Bove’s behavior in the Adams case manifests an evident top-down policy of transforming the DOJ into an instrument of reward and punishment for presidential allies and foes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate A Dangerous New Supreme Court Case Could Open the Door to Prosecutions for DEI Read More\n\nHo and his judicial colleagues confronting analogous cases need to stop thinking like single judges dealing with a single awkward case. Rather, they need to recognize that they are representatives of the justice system and the legal profession confronted with an unapologetic attack on the rule of law. When government lawyers misbehave, federal judges must be more assertive in the exercise of their powers as members of the judicial branch and as integral players in disciplinary mechanisms of the legal profession.\n\nIf confronted by apparent government attorney misconduct or apparent defiance of court orders, judges should first do the very thing Clement rejects—insist on determining the facts. Do not accept vague unsworn platitudes. Put the relevant witnesses, including lawyers, on the stand under oath. Let counsel adverse to the government ask questions. If the case is one like the Adams matter, where the government may be improperly colluding with the other side, judges should ask questions themselves. They should make factual findings. This alone would serve the immensely valuable purpose of advising the public of the judicial view of government misbehavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, when appropriate, judges should use their civil contempt powers promptly and sternly. As I have written elsewhere, there is, distressingly, some doubt that the Marshals Service would enforce contempt remedies against executive branch officials. But the test must be conducted. At the worst, direct executive branch defiance of judicial contempt orders will clarify for the public the true nature of the Trump regime.\n\nFinally, if a reasonable basis exists to believe that government lawyers have misrepresented facts to the court or otherwise behaved unethically, judges should promptly refer offenders to disciplinary authorities of the court or the relevant state bar. As the Supreme Court held in Imbler v. Pachtman, the government lawyer “stands perhaps unique, among officials whose acts could deprive persons of constitutional rights, in his amenability to professional discipline by an association of his peers.” The organized bar should address judicial referrals of misbehaving government lawyers without hesitation and, when merited, with stringent punishment. Even amoral or timorous lawyers will hesitate to misbehave if it becomes clear that doing so endangers their livelihood.\n\nThe rule of law in America is in peril. The formal institutions created by the Constitution to ensure the survival of the rule of law are wavering. But the idea that law, not one man, should rule is older than the Constitution. That idea is, or should be, the bedrock commitment of the legal profession. Indeed, we lawyers tout it all the time, at least when our professed devotion has no cost. The question now is whether the legal profession will use its power over its own members to ensure that law survives.",

        "content": "Dear Prudence is Slate’s advice column. Delia Cai is filling in as Prudie for Jenée Desmond-Harris while she’s on parental leave. Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI’m a young-ish woman starting therapy for the first time. It’s been an overwhelming process both because of the logistical hurdles of finding someone in network in addition to working on my own internalized stigma towards therapy, but I was able to find someone and make an appointment with them. Several days after making the appointment, I dug deeper and out of curiosity looked my soon-to-be-therapist up on various social media platforms (I had done a very cursory google search of her but didn’t go much deeper than that). I was shocked when I found her personal Instagram account.\n\nIt was full of racy photos of her, some of which showed her face, posing suggestively in what looks like bondage gear and lingerie—along with links to her Only Fans account! I felt shocked that given her professional role, she would have her first and last name attached to these. I’m already kind of a prude (which is something I do want to talk about in therapy and unpack!) but I don’t think I could focus with a therapist when all I can think about is what she looks like posing in a leather thong. When I told my friends I was thinking about canceling my appointment and finding another therapist because it made me uncomfortable, they said I was slut shaming and that there’s nothing wrong with a therapist having an Only Fans. One of them even said that this was actively discriminating against sex workers and that seeing a therapist who is a sex worker would be beneficial for me to “humanize” them and that it could help me work through my own issues (I come from what many people might consider to be a very sexually repressed background). Any thoughts about what I should do? Is it discrimination to switch to another therapist because of this? And more generally speaking, do you think it’s OK for someone in a professional role like this to post public content like that? My friends evidently think it’s unabashedly OK, but I know other people in my life would find it unfathomable, so I’m curious where you stand on this.\n\n—Prude or Prudent?\n\nDear Prudent,\n\nYou can and absolutely should switch to another therapist. For one thing, I’d say that being exposed to your therapist’s social media—whatever its contents are—is simply too much information to have. In my experience, a successful therapeutic relationship requires the ability to see your therapist strictly as your therapist. I have had two therapists over the past eight years, and both of them took great care to never reveal much about themselves or their personal lives; I think that was a necessary part of the dynamic, because otherwise I would have been projecting all kinds of irrelevant judgments and assumptions on them. I probably wouldn’t have taken their advice as seriously, especially if I knew about their choices.\n\nThere’s a general belief that we often gravitate toward therapists who “replicate” certain dynamics with key figures for us; this was a key plot point in Season 4 of This Is Us for Randal Pearson’s storyline, for example. I can personally attest to the fact that I saw my first therapist, who was middle-aged and male, as a father-like authority, and that I see my current therapist, who is my age and female, as an older sister-like figure. What I’m saying is that it’s extremely important to the overall project of going to therapy to feel comfortable with your therapist, because they are going to provoke a lot of feelings and model how you feel about other relationships in your lives. So really, if you’re not comfortable with a certain therapist for any reason, I’d advise you should switch.\n\nI think your friends are being judgy; this isn’t discrimination, but you are also being judgy, too. To answer your question about whether it’s OK to post that kind of public content as a professional: My general rule is that I think adults can do whatever they want as long as they’re not harming others, but I personally don’t have to approve of anyone’s choices. And neither do you. We all get to make judgments about what kind of behavior we like or dislike in other people, and we’re all allowed to make decisions based on those judgments.\n\nMaybe you do have a few beliefs that would qualify as “prudish,” and that affects what kind of people you surround yourself with. That’s entirely okay. You’ve already mentioned that this is something you’d like to address in therapy anyway.\n\nIt often takes a few tries with different providers to find the therapist that you click with totally, so this is all quite normal.

When we visited, I was barely allowed to bring extra underwear because all our luggage was crammed with gifts. I hated it—I would have third or fourth cousins screaming in my face that they wanted brand new iPhone and Air Jordans and we better pony up even more money. I understand the country is very impoverished, but I never felt more like a sheep getting sheared. We were raising three kids in a two-bedroom townhouse and sharing a car as old as our oldest and my ex would be sending money to build yet another house for some random relative. I hit my breaking point after getting a second job in order to save money for getting braces for our girls and maybe make another bedroom for our son. My ex raided it and sent the majority back to support a local church that one of her cousins attended.\n\nWe got divorced, and since our girls turned 18 last year, the child support has ended. My ex lost her job and the house has a cracked foundation and water damage, but she is still sending thousands a month back to her relatives. My girls both dropped out of school and are working full time in retail. They give their mother their entire paycheck and they coming to call on me for more money. I am already covering their car and medical insurance, but it kills me when they call me crying because the light bill hasn’t been paid again. My girls refuse to consider moving out and leaving their mom. I have begged, pleaded, and bargained with them, nothing works. I am disgusted and disappointed about how my ex is leeching off our kids like she did me in our marriage. I don’t know what to do, just this situation is not sustainable.\n\n—No Room for the Old Country\n\nDear No Room,\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that, quite often, our loved ones will choose to spend their money in ways that we don’t approve of. You experienced this lesson in the extreme with your ex; it sounded like she made financial decisions that you didn’t support, and this became untenable for your marriage. Now that you are no longer in any kind of joint financial arrangement with her (via marriage or child support), that means you are both financially independent from each other—which means that you really don’t have any kind of permit to judge her choices anymore.\n\nObviously, this has become a painful situation because she has involved your children in her decisions. But the other unfortunate truth is that your daughters are now adults, which means that it’s their choice as a grown-up to spend their money the way they want (even if that means supporting their mother’s choices). To put it bluntly: If everyone’s an adult, you don’t have a say in how they spend.\n\nIt goes both ways, though, because that means they also don’t get a say in how you spend your money (i.e. whether you give them assistance or not). I think you need to draw a hard boundary with your daughters. Of course, it’s easier to absolve your financial responsibility to an ex than it is to your children, but as you said yourself, this situation where you’re being asked to send money and then feel utterly resentful about it is unsustainable for your relationship with your children. You will have to find a way to explain to them clearly and neutrally something along the lines of, “Now that you’re adults, I respect the choices you make about the money you earn, even though you know how I feel about these choices. I think it’s better for our relationship to keep my support limited to your car and medical insurance, because otherwise, I’m only going to grow resentful and attach strings to the money I give you.”\n\nIt’s highly possible that your daughters will take this as an affront, and they might even give you the cold shoulder for a while. But it’s up to them to learn the hard lesson of deciding where their values and priorities lie, and to deal with the consequences of those decisions. That’s what adulthood’s all about, and you’re only holding them back from these lessons the longer you try to keep control.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy husband and I have worked ourselves to the bone to provide the best start for our three kids. I only make around 40k a year and the majority has gone towards paying for our kids to go to college without loans. My husband and I were very blunt that we expected our kids to keep their grades up and graduate in four years. Our kids are all roughly four years apart. There is no way we could pay for more than one a year.\n\nWe also told them not to expect us to fund their lifestyles. They could always come live at home, but they would need to work and save money. We weren’t going get into the Peter Pan trap of many of our peers. My own mother worked herself into an early grave because my brothers never grew up beyond hitting on younger girls and spending all their money on weed.\n\nOur daughter, “Darla,” has always been difficult. We fought a lot over her refusal to consider summer classes because she wanted to socialize instead. She skated through school and changed her degree twice. That meant she was only half done with her degree by the time her younger brother started college. It was a huge blow out when we told her she to get a job and loans. She has moved in and out of our house several times because she found the house rules not to her liking. Darla was of the mind that she could come and go as she pleased, take the car without asking, and have her boyfriends sleep over, and quit her job if she didn’t get the shift she wanted.\n\nIt has been exhausting. When Darla met “Brandon,” she seemed to finally calm down and grow up. They share an apartment and both of them work. Darla has talked about finishing her degree and even grad school. Then they announced their engagement. We were happy but told our daughter that we wouldn’t be able to contribute much to the wedding. We needed to save for retirement, and our youngest was in his final year of college. (He took a two year hiatus after being in a car wreck that killed his girlfriend and two others. A drunk driver plowed right into them.) How our daughter responded was disgraceful. Darla screamed about how we always favored her brothers and we were obligated to pay for the wedding by tradition. My husband told Darla the marriage license was $50 and he would cover it if they wanted to get married next week, and that it sounded more like she wanted to play princess for a day than actually be a wife.\n\nDarla responded by attacking her brother and daring to blame him for the deaths. I think my son would have decked his sister if we weren’t in the room. Since then our family is fractured. Neither of our sons will talk to their sister and have spoken about boycotting the wedding. Darla only calls us when she wants to relitigate the fight. I love our daughter, but we didn’t raise her with this sense of entitlement. I married her father in a borrowed dress at the local church. Our first dance was to a cassette tape. So what do we do here?\n\n—About Darla\n\nDear About Darla,\n\nFrankly, I don’t think there’s anything you can do here. Darla’s anger and resentment is a problem that she has to deal with on her own, and there’s nothing you can say that will magically speed up that process.\n\nYou and your husband have set a reasonable boundary with her, and she’s reacting by lashing out. Everyone’s an adult here and is making their own choices, which are equally valid (if not equally reasonable). Resist the urge to play family peacemaker, and let your adult children decide if and how they want to work this out. In the meantime, stick to your boundary and reiterate, if need be, the specific ways you can offer support (i.e. the $50 marriage license, or time on the phone with a son who needs to vent). But I’d urge you to stay in the wings of the larger wedding conflict as best as you can; Darla will likely continue to not handle things the way you’d want, but she’s grown-up now, and unfortunately, that’s her prerogative. You have to step back and let her be who she’s going to be.\n\n—Delia\n\nCatch up on this week’s Prudie.\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy husband has always been very healthy, but he is now well into his 50s and is starting to develop issues.

It’s anonymous!\n\nDear Good Job,\n\nI have a co-worker who has terrible flatulence. He is an absolute misery to be around as a result.\n\nHe comes through our floor at least three or four times a day and afterward, the place stinks like a broken septic tank. The rub is that he’s also the head of our department and twice a week our team is required to meet with him to give updates on productivity and other things. These meetings usually are around an hour long, and by the time they are over I’m nearly sick. My other colleagues are similarly at the end of their ropes. Aside from trying to sneak some Beano into his coffee, what are our options here?\n\n—Waiting to Inhale\n\nDear Waiting,\n\nHow much unnecessary suffering have human beings endured because we’re squeamish about butt stuff? Being that gassy must be uncomfortable for your co-worker, even if COVID ruined his sense of smell. He might have lactose intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, or another condition that he could manage but isn’t. Even if his flatulence isn’t fully treatable, he should be more considerate about your shared air.\n\nSo where does that leave you? Team meetings where people update their managers on productivity are often … unproductive. You could suggest reducing the number of meetings or converting them to shared documents or emails. You could ask to have your meetings outdoors or in an open area. Explain that carbon dioxide concentration rises quickly in a closed conference room, and everybody thinks better in fresh air. When meetings can’t be avoided, you can anoint your upper lip with Vick’s VapoRub, scented Chapstick, or mint oil, like some medical students do when they’re dissecting cadavers.\n\nBut at some point, somebody’s gotta talk to him. Does he have a friend at the office who could say, sympathetically, that he’s noticed your co-worker is having some gastrointestinal problems? Digestion is messy and nothing to be ashamed of. Your gassy co-worker might be embarrassed, but a kind word might encourage him to get screened for whatever is causing his—and your—distress.\n\n—Laura\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nI use Facebook pretty much exclusively for a local hobby group, and recently had a weird interaction that flowed over to real life.

        "content": "How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? Send it to Jessica and Rich here. It’s anonymous!\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nI live next to a nerdy early 30s guy, Kris, and his younger jock boyfriend, Karl. At first, I didn’t think much of them, but over the past few weeks, their relationship has turned into a total soap opera. Karl is this tall, muscular, macho dude. Kris is a great guy, but from what I can overhear, Karl treats him like garbage. They’re constantly arguing, and Karl has started bringing another guy over for loud, obnoxious sex almost every night.\n\nI have always considered myself straight. But lately … something’s changed. Hearing them has started to turn me on. I know it’s wrong, and I know I shouldn’t be getting involved, but I can’t stop thinking about it. The idea of Karl hearing me with Kris is driving me crazy. I know it’s messed up, but the thought of “cucking” Karl, this super-masculine guy who seems to think he’s untouchable, is weirdly thrilling to me. Kris and I have flirted a few times in the hallway, and I know he likes me. I’m sure he’d be game.\n\nThere’s something about Karl’s arrogant confidence, his total dominance, that’s making me feel things I don’t understand. And the idea of getting one over on him by being with Kris is just … I can’t stop thinking about it. The more I hear them, the more obsessed I become with the idea.\n\nI know I shouldn’t get involved, but the temptation is overwhelming. What should I do? Is this just some weird fantasy I need to get out of my system, or is there something deeper going on here? I’ve never felt this way before, and it’s freaking me out.\n\n—Curious to Cuck\n\nDear Curious to Cuck,\n\nYou’re right, you should not be getting involved. Inserting yourself (literally) into a soap opera will likely only beget more drama. Given the volatility of the Kris-Karl dynamic, and your suspicion that Karl is mistreating Kris, consider a possible outcome of you having sex with Kris: more mistreatment. Even worse, the scenario you envision is one in which Karl hears you with Kris, which implies at least the possibility that you want to do this without Karl’s knowledge or consent ahead of time. Do you think someone who is already shitty to his boyfriend will take hearing his boyfriend get railed a wall away in stride? It’s possible, but the risks are great.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact is that you do not know the terms of these dudes’ arrangement. Whether it seems fair or not, they may have a rule where only Karl gets to have outside sex. They may both need to be present. Maybe Kris isn’t allowed to bottom for anyone besides Karl. You would have to navigate the terms of their openness (if they are in fact open, which seems likely but is also unclear) with both of them in order for this to be ethical. You can’t cuck Karl without Karl’s consent, and if he is into it then you’d kind of be doing him a favor no matter how much you tear into Kris.\n\nI say let this Kris-Karl cuck concept exist as a fantasy. If you’re curious about guys for real, there are plenty of gay couples who would gladly have a straight dude over to plow one or both of them. Go on a hook-up app, label yourself as a straight guy who wants to cuck a gay couple and watch the requests pour in.\n\nGet advice—submit a question!

Dear How to Do It, * Your letter signoff Your pronouns Your email (optional and confidential—please include if you're open to How to Do It following up) Submit\n\nDear How To Do It,\n\nI am a 26-year-old male. One morning last week, I cut my hand while doing dishes at my girlfriend’s house. It was a small cut, so I called her while she was at work to ask if she had some Band-Aids. She told me they were in the bottom left side drawer of the bathroom vanity. There, on top of the box of Band-Aids, was a tube of vaginal itch cream (Vagisil). I put it back and checked the next day when getting another Band-Aid, and the tube had been turned. I checked the next day and it had been moved again. Same thing the following day. It seemed like she was using it on a daily basis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis wouldn’t normally be a concern, but after going for years without a case of jock itch, I have had two recent cases. A prescription from my doctor cleared it up, but it got me thinking: Am I “catching” something from her? We are exclusive, so we no longer use condoms. Should I be concerned about catching (I couldn’t think of a better term) something more serious? Is there reason to be alarmed she uses this stuff everyday? If there is a concern, how do I bring it up to her?\n\n—The Fire (Itch) Down Below\n\nDear The Fire (Itch) Down Below,\n\nIt’s very difficult to say for sure what’s going on in the absence of a known diagnosis for your girlfriend. But here are a few things we do know: Jock itch is absolutely contagious and can be contracted via skin-to-skin contact, including during sex. Jock itch is caused by a fungus (tinea cruris). Vagisil, in its original-recipe form, is not an antifungal medication. Its main active ingredient is benzocaine, an anesthetic. If your girlfriend has jock itch, Vagisil may alleviate the pain, but it won’t clear it up. However, Vagisil does make a line of yeast-infection treatments that contain miconazole nitrate, an antifungal that is used to treat jock itch as well. (The fungus that causes yeast infections is Candida, typically Candida albicans. It can also itch and may result in a cottage cheese-like discharge.) My guess is that she’s using the plain, old anti-itch version to alleviate her pain without actually getting rid of the fungus. So the fungus persists and so does pain, which leads to further Vagisil use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yes, the jock itch may have been transmitted from her to you. But, as you can see, this is something that is cleared up easily. I think it’s quite reasonable to tell your girlfriend, “Look, I had jock itch twice and I noticed that you have been using Vagisil. Do you think maybe you have jock itch, too?” If she isn’t already using an antifungal, then giving her this heads up will help mitigate her pain and allow her body to recover. As her boyfriend, you should be so helpful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould you be concerned about something more serious? I mean, not based on the fact that your girlfriend may have jock itch alone, but sure, transmission is a possibility with partners. Viruses like HPV and herpes may be dormant or totally asymptomatic. When you’re having sex with someone, there’s always the risk of bacterial infections like syphilis and gonorrhea as well. Even in theoretically monogamous arrangements, sometimes people cheat, which can lead to infection risk. Trust is going to be key here, but I really don’t think a persistent case of jock itch is a good cause to become distrustful. Truly not a big deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\n\nThe columnists behind our new advice column, Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\n\nDear How to Do It,\n\nI’m a 31-year-old gay man who was recently diagnosed with HSV-1: genital herpes caused by the cold sore virus. I honestly had no idea that you could get genital herpes by receiving oral sex from someone who has ever had a cold sore on their mouth (even if they don’t have one when you hook up).\n\nMy doctor told me that I don’t need to “walk around with a red H on my chest” and said that he does not think it’s necessary to tell sexual partners that I have HSV-1. He said that the risk of transmission is very low without symptoms, and that I just got very unlucky.\n\nHowever, I feel uncomfortable with the idea of not telling someone about this, because there is technically a small risk of transmission. Unlike with HIV, you can’t take medication to prevent getting herpes, and taking herpes antivirals cannot suppress the virus to undetectable levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was recently chatting with a guy on Scruff for a couple days. Once the conversation turned towards meeting up, I told him that I had GHSV-1, that the risk of transmission was very low but not zero, and to feel free to read about it and let me know if he had any questions. He flipped out at me and said I wasted his time, and blocked me.\n\nI feel pretty down after this experience. Most people already have HSV-1 and have antibodies to it. But I feel like the stigma is too great to not tell this to sexual partners. At the same time, I sincerely doubt that anyone with cold sores on their mouth is telling sexual partners they could give them genital herpes. So, am I just making this way harder on myself than I need to by being honest?\n\n—Herpes Hesitant\n\nDear Herpes Hesitant,\n\nThere is no real easy answer to this, as your letter suggests. If you think about the man-on-man hook-up app ecosystem, it is extremely rare for people to disclose any kind of herpes upfront, by which I mean in their profiles. It’s probably a bit more common in private chats, but still unusual, at least in my anecdotal experience. I can think of one or two guys who have mentioned it, out of what must be thousands that I’ve talked to through the years. It’s not like HIV in that respect, where there are plenty of guys who note their status in their profiles. Also, while inconvenient, sometimes painful, and occasionally responsible for complications, herpes is nowhere nearly as serious as HIV. You’re right, valacyclovir isn’t a magic bullet (though it does significantly reduce the risk of transmission), but a key difference here is that if you don’t take herpes antiretrovirals, herpes in all likelihood isn’t going to kill you. The same cannot be said for HIV in the vast majority of cases. Herpes stigma is high, but its actual stakes on quality of life are much lower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the cultural vibe, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage by being honest (no one said that being ethical is easy!) You say it yourself in your letter: You feel uncomfortable with the idea of not telling someone about your herpes. And so, you should do what you think is right. For a lot of guys, the risk of contracting herpes is implicit and that’s why they don’t talk about it. Group/public sex is a major feature of modern urban gay culture, and in the age of PrEP, this activity is often done without physical barriers like condoms. I’ve never been to a sex party where I’ve heard the guys discussing their HSV or HPV status. It is assumed that possible contraction of these viruses, if it hasn’t happened already, goes with the territory. That doesn’t mean you need to fall into lockstep with the prevailing laissez faire attitudes of gay hook-up culture. You can be different and disclose and shoulder the rejection that may come with it. I bet you’ll encounter guys, unlike your Scruff near miss, who don’t care and will hook up with you anyway.\n\nJust one thing to keep in mind, though: According to herpes expert Anna Wald, a doctor and professor of medicine and epidemiology at University of Washington School of Medicine, whom I have interviewed before for this column, “Transmission from genital HSV-1 is unusual, because genital HSV-1 does not reactivate very often.” So you’d be disclosing a very slight amount of risk. If that helps you sleep at night, though, go for it.\n\n—Rich\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy girlfriend recently instituted a new rule: No touch, ever. I mean like, no hugging, no kissing, no snuggling. This has forced me to seek out physical affection from friends, which feels super weird—even though it’s platonic for me, to her it feels like cheating. I’m kind of suffering here, and so is she.

Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy husband and I have been happily married for almost 50 years. We have four children and gave them the most stable, loving, idyllic childhood imaginable. I had my career but worked from home to more fully devote myself to them and our household. We were always happy and we’re still close, but none of them seem to want to pass that happiness on to a new generation.\n\nMy 46-year-old son is a devastatingly handsome man with a brilliant career, but I wasn’t at all surprised when he recently revealed he had a vasectomy in his 20s; otherwise, he would have left behind a string of illegitimate pregnancies. He has never been married, simply trades his much younger girlfriends in every few years like cars. My 44-year-old daughter also has a fantastic career but has never been interested in marriage or children. My 42-year-old daughter claimed she wanted a family, but only ever picked terrible, glamorous but unfaithful men; the last one just left her after stringing her along until her biological clock ran out. My 38-year-old son is gay and completely uninterested in settling down, much less having a family. I love each of them with all my heart. But my heart breaks with the knowledge that I will almost certainly never have a grandchild.\n\nIn contrast, take my younger half-sister. She’s been married and divorced three times and has had countless shorter-term relationships. The legal father of her only daughter demanded a paternity test, abandoned their then 6-year-old daughter when she turned out not to be biologically his, and when ordered to pay child support anyway, moved overseas to avoid it. She then proceeded to drag my niece through hell, forcing her to swap homes and father figures almost yearly, to live with an older stepbrother who assaulted her, and a religious fanatic who beat both of them. And guess what? My niece married a wonderful, well-off young man at 26, and now at 28 is expecting her first child. My sister, despite having saved nowhere near enough to support herself, is planning to retire early and move in with her to help care for the baby. And they say they want three to five children!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven’t said anything about my feelings to anyone but my husband, and I don’t plan to. But emotionally I’m struggling to accept how my sister can be forgiven for being a barely adequate mother, setting a dreadful example of marriage, and still become a grandmother, while we can do everything right, give our children the world, and not receive the same reward. Do you have any advice to help me reconcile this in my mind?\n\n—Silently Struggling\n\nDear Struggling,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be honest, I found your letter a bit heartbreaking to read, particularly from the way you seem to equate “having grandchildren” as the only “reward” that matters. I hope that you haven’t communicated this sentiment to your four children directly, because it would be quite heartbreaking for them to hear that, despite having successfully cultivated independent lives of their own, you don’t seem to see much value in their happiness if grandkids aren’t involved. Maybe you don’t agree with all of the choices that your adult children have made for themselves, but if they’re happy, healthy, and enjoying their independence, that’s the kind of “reward” many, many parents would be thrilled to receive. Sure, settling down and having a family can be fulfilling, but it’s not for everyone. You should be proud that your kids are pursuing their own forms of fulfillment, and I think you should consider the possibility that your resentment over this grandkids situation may be affecting your relationships with them, however subconsciously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sympathetic to your pain. It’s clear that having grandchildren is important to you, and that you are mourning the fact that you may not get to experience that part of life. Rather than taking this resentment out on your children (or your half-sister—more on that in a second), I would encourage you to find an outlet for some of the energy behind this desire. If you’re wanting to spend time with kids, you might consider volunteering or simply being more involved with the children within your own social circles as a de facto great-aunt or god-mother. But if it’s a matter of keeping busy and feeling fulfilled yourself, I suggest throwing yourself into hobbies, a cause or two that you care about, or your friendships. Your future might look different than you imagined, but it can still be a very full one. Perhaps speaking to a professional therapist will also help you deal with the grief for this imagined other life, and help you find acceptance for the one you do have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think a therapist could also help you unpack some of those feelings your harboring toward your half-sister. I find it concerning how little empathy you seem to have for your half-sister, who sounds like she’s had a pretty chaotic and painful life. You seem to take issue with the fact that she could have made so many disagreeable choices in the past and still wind up with a fulfilling life, which you now envy. There seems to be some unresolved tension in your relationship with her, because the way you compare your situation with hers is, frankly, rather child-like. It sounds like you’re saying, “She got this, but I deserved it more!” Look, family relationships make us all batty at any age, but I would imagine that this mindset is making you miserable. Talk to someone who can provide you a good outlet for some much-needed venting—and guide you to a more peaceful state of acceptance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet advice from Prudie—submit a question!

Dear Prudence, * Your letter signoff Your pronouns Your email (optional and confidential—please include if you're open to Dear Prudence following up) Submit\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI work at a local garden nursery, and I recently witnessed an interaction between a customer and a regular that left me unsure about whether I should have stepped in. One of our regulars, an older man who knows a lot about gardening, was chatting with me and a co-worker near the register when a woman walked in. She went straight to the shelves, grabbed a seed-starting item, and headed for checkout. As she approached, the man casually asked, “Starting some seeds?” His tone was friendly. He was just making conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe woman barely looked at him and muttered, “Yep,” in a cold, uninterested tone. She exaggeratedly stepped around him, as if he was physically in her way, which he wasn’t at all. He was just standing there, the same as before. Still, he didn’t seem offended and followed up with, “Can I give you some advice?” Again, his tone was polite, and given his knowledge, I figured he probably had something useful to share. But the woman cut him off with a sharp, “No, thank you,” her voice clipped and dismissive, like she couldn’t believe he dared to speak to her. The man looked surprised but just said, “Oh, OK,” and didn’t press the issue. After that, the whole store went awkwardly silent. I rang her up quickly, and she left without another word, clearly irritated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI understand that not everyone wants unsolicited advice, but he wasn’t pushy or rude. He was just being friendly, and she acted like he was harassing her. It was so unnecessarily hostile that I felt bad for him. At the same time, I didn’t know if I should have said anything—maybe lightened the mood or reassured him afterward. Should I have stepped in somehow? If so, what would have been the right way to handle it?\n\n—Unsure and Uneasy\n\nDear Unsure,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don’t think it would have been helpful for you to step in while this interaction was happening; whatever was going on with this customer, I doubt she would have welcomed feeling like the staff was ganging up on her. Unfortunately, rude customers are just one of life’s reliable annoyances, and there isn’t much to be done about them.\n\nHowever, I do think you could have said something to your regular, who probably felt embarrassed by the exchange. He may have wondered if he did something wrong, and it would have been kind of you (or anyone else on staff) to reaffirm his read of the situation—i.e., that this customer was frosty and weird, and that you didn’t like how she treated him. People generally just want their experiences validated; it’s like walking by when someone trips and asking if they’re hurt. You’re not asking because you’re a medical professional or because they’re actually physically harmed; it’s just a way of saying, “I saw what happened, and I care that you’re OK.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\n\nThe columnists behind our advice column, Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work.

Would asking her to find someone else to run with be rude?\n\n—Not Interested in a Snail’s Pace\n\nDear Not Interested,\n\nIt depends on your girlfriend’s motives. If she’s asking to go for a run together because she wants to bond with you over your favorite activity, then yes, it would be quite rude to tell her outright that she’s too slow for you. You will need to come up with some creative solutions—maybe you could do your usual 10 miles first, and then do a victory lap with her at a slower pace. Or you can propose an alternative activity that shows you appreciate her need for spending time together, and want to bond with her too.\n\nBut if your girlfriend is just trying to get more into running herself, I think you can be slightly more honest. Tell her that you’re a little weird and intense about your personal running routine, but that if it’s important to her, you’d be happy to set aside a morning or two in the coming months for a jogging date. Don’t make this an issue about her speed though; just claim that you’re very particular and set in your ways when it concerns running in a way that simply won’t be fun for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy friends Lucy and Olive have met a few times over the years. A few weeks ago, I hosted a party where they saw each other for the first time in a long time. I recently discovered that Lucy shared her struggle to find a job, so Olive recommended her for a one-year contract position at her workplace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe’re all in our mid-20s. Olive is killing it at her corporate job. She was recently promoted and oversees a small team. Lucy’s more of a free spirit. She’s had a few short-term jobs since graduating college. She lives with her parents and travels abroad a lot, but I know she’s pretty unhappy and feels down about struggling to land a full-time job.\n\nLucy told me the biggest downside of this job is the really long contract term (her words, not mine). I expect she’ll quickly ask for time off to travel and won’t complete the full year, as she’s done this with previous jobs. I love my friend, but I know work isn’t her priority. And I worry it will reflect poorly on Olive, who really cares about her job. Should I give Olive a heads-up about what I know? Have a conversation with Lucy before she accepts the job? Or should I just stay out of it?\n\n—Concerned Friend\n\nDear Concerned,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would stay out of it. Any attempts to fill in either Olive or Lucy about what you know—or what you think you know about Lucy’s intentions and Olive’s professional standing—about this potential employment situation could easily backfire. Then you’ll be the one to blame. Olive and Lucy are grown-ups who can handle their careers on their own. Give Olive’s company some credit, too, for being able to suss out what they may need to suss out, should Lucy undergo the interview process. There are professionals and processes in place for figuring out if Lucy is a good match for the role; you absolutely not need to involve yourself personally.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nFor the last year ,I’ve been attending a weightlifting class three times a week, with a rotating group of about 20 regulars. It’s mostly women but a few men attend too who really gel with everyone. It’s a really positive class and everyone chats before and after and cheers each other on during class. Everyone always says it’s the people who keep them coming back, including me!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe slight issue is that about every other month, we try to go out for a happy hour or something after our workout. While the concept of, “Hey anyone up for some beers on a patio right now?” after lifting sounds great, in reality, it just isn’t fun. There are a few people in the group who honestly just talk too much (including our otherwise beloved instructor) and are constantly doing this strange thing of trying to outdo each other with sardonic anecdotes about dating, their families, etc. I imagine this is a common workplace scenario but I’ve been self-employed for so long that I’m out of practice on how to avoid irritating people to connect with the ones I like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn’t the most serious issue, but do you have any thoughts on how to shift the tide of a group conversation when one or two people keep taking over others? There’s not anyone specifically I’m interested in seeing one-on-one but I do really care about the group dynamic as I spend more time with these people than most of my close friends!\n\n—Tired of the Monologuing\n\nDear Tired,\n\nI think there is a certain level of acceptance—or maybe it’s something more like tolerance—that you will have to build back up for these kinds of annoying conversational inevitabilities, especially if it’s once a month. Group dynamics are particularly difficult when the group is just small enough where people can’t really break out into individual sidebars of their choosing, and it feels like everyone is held hostage to listen to the dominant personalities.\n\nYou could try to socially engineer a situation where there’s a bit more mixing by suggesting a bar where people can’t all sit down at one large table or where there’s a secondary activity (like cornhole or bocce ball, for example) going on. But you might also have to get comfortable jumping in between these monologues yourself. “Wait, I have a question for the group…” is a great way to pivot the conversation; I’m sure the other members of your group will be relieved to have a change in topic.\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy husband has a gay friend from high school.

A slew of appeals courts have invalidated such measures, concluding that they violate the Second Amendment rights of people under 21. It seemed inevitable that these decisions would build a consensus that the Supreme Court might embrace—until Friday, when a court broke from the pack in a surprise decision. By an 8–4 vote, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit last week upheld Florida’s law prohibiting 18- to 20-year-olds from buying guns. Better yet, the court’s opinion was authored by Chief Judge William Pryor, a highly influential George W. Bush appointee. Pryor’s decision is doggedly originalist, a meticulous history lesson that proves the constitutionality of Florida’s ban beyond all reasonable doubt. It might just be persuasive enough to convince his ideological allies on the Supreme Court to uphold this lifesaving limit on the right to bear arms.\n\nAt least 22 states limit the ability of young adults ages 18 to 20 to buy weapons. So does federal law, which generally bars those under 21 from buying a handgun. These measures have come under legal fire at the U.S. Courts of Appeals as the Supreme Court has steadily expanded the Second Amendment. Already this year, the 5th Circuit has struck down the federal age restriction as unconstitutional. And the 3rd Circuit refused to revisit a recent decision invalidating Pennsylvania laws that bar those under 21 from carrying guns in public during a state of emergency. Last year, the 8th Circuit tossed out a Minnesota law forbidding those under 21 from obtaining a public carry permit. And in 2022, the 9th Circuit struck down California’s ban on the sale of rifles to those who are 18 to 20. (That decision was later set aside for reasons unrelated to the merits, though the 9th Circuit has not yet repudiated it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate A Dangerous New Supreme Court Case Could Open the Door to Prosecutions for DEI Read More\n\nThese decisions were frustrating for two primary reasons. First, they were deadly: We know that people under 21 are far more likely to commit violent crime, especially with guns. One study, for instance, found that people ages 18 to 20 commit gun homicides at triple the rate of adults 21 and up. FBI data shows that this group commits deadly shootings at a much higher rate than older Americans. A disproportionate number of our deadliest mass shootings were committed by 18- to 20-year-olds who bought their weapons legally—including the Parkland shooter, whose massacre prompted Florida to enact its age restriction. Simply put, the data confirms that restricting young people from possessing firearms is a crucial tool for protecting all Americans from gun violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, the decisions striking down those age-based laws purported to be originalist, yet they were, at their core, living constitutionalism at its most freewheeling and undisciplined. SCOTUS has instructed lower courts to uphold firearm regulations that comport with the nation’s “history and tradition.” And in 1791, when the Second Amendment was ratified, people under age 21 were considered legal minors with virtually no rights themselves, including the right to buy or possess weapons without their parents’ consent. It is true that in the 20th century, most states shifted the age of majority back to 18. But that development does not mean that, as an originalist matter, the government violates our “history and tradition” when it applies the 18th-century age of majority to gun possession.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe courts that rejected this reality relied on the fact that in 1791, states often compelled 18- to 20-year-olds to join “the militia,” which required them to bear arms. Gun rights advocates raised this argument at the 11th Circuit, as well—and they had good reason to think they’d prevail. After all, the court has a strong majority of Republican appointees. And after an unusually liberal three-judge panel upheld Florida’s law in 2023, the full court swept away its decision, choosing to rehear the case en banc (with every judge participating). Typically, a rehearing en banc indicates that the full court disagrees with the panel decision. But that didn’t happen here. Instead, the en banc court reached the same conclusion. And in the process, it provided vital new support and legitimacy for the legal basis behind these age restrictions nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChief Judge Pryor’s majority opinion is so cogent and compelling that it almost makes you believe that courts can fairly apply the hopelessly unworkable “history and tradition” test. He began by recounting the gruesome facts of the Parkland massacre, vividly reminding readers of the horrors that precipitated the statute’s enactment. From there, he explained that at the nation’s birth, “a person was an ‘infant’ or a ‘minor’ in the eyes of the law until age 21”—an ancient rule of English law that the founders carried over to America. “The Founders’ generation shared the view,” Pryor wrote, “that minors lacked the reason and judgment necessary to be trusted with legal rights,” quoting Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. Because of this “lack of reason,” minors “were subject to the ‘power’ of their parents until they reached age 21.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 18th century, this “legal incapacity” deprived minors of “the capacity to contract, and to purchase goods on account.” They also generally had no income of their own, because their parents lay claim to any wages they earned for work. As a result, minors could not buy firearms themselves; they lacked both the legal right and the actual money to do so. When the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791, then, Americans ages 18 to 20 had no right to buy or possess a gun. So Florida’s law, and others like it, are “consistent with our historical tradition of firearm regulation.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what about mandatory militia service for those under 21? Unlike other federal courts, Pryor took the time to canvass the historical record. And he found that “states addressed the problem of providing minors the firearms necessary for militia service in different ways.” Some “exempted minors from the firearm requirement entirely.” Others “required parents of minors to acquire firearms for their militia service.” Another group “implicitly required parents to supply minors with firearms” by subjecting them to fines if their children did not obtain weapons. As universal militia service faded in the 19th century, many states enacted outright bans on the sale or transfer of firearms to people under 21.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese laws held firm until deep into the 20th century, when most states embraced 18 as the new age of majority. But as Pryor explained, “the federal right to keep and bear arms” does not turn on “a sliding scale defined by contemporary state law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.” A state does not “lose its constitutional authority to regulate minors’ access to firearms” just because it gives 18-year-olds “greater rights than they would have enjoyed at the Founding.” To hold otherwise would mean importing into the Second Amendment “an evolving standard of adulthood that is divorced from the text of the Amendment and from our regulatory tradition.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is hard to overstate the significance of these words coming from the pen of a deeply conservative, dyed-in-the-wool Federalist Society stalwart like Pryor. He is arguably the most influential appeals court judge active today: Supreme Court justices regularly cite him by name, invoking his authority to bolster their own arguments—a rare honor reserved for marquee lower-court jurists. By embracing the constitutionality of Florida’s law, he has instantly increased the odds that SCOTUS will say such age restrictions comply with the Second Amendment. Chief Justice John Roberts, along with Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, will take his opinion very seriously when they decide this issue. And they likely will soon, because there is a growing circuit split that the Supreme Court will feel obligated to resolve. (The 10th Circuit has also upheld an age ban.)\n\nThanks to Pryor, the justices now have exhaustive historical evidence that the Framers would have no objection to age limits on gun purchase or possession. It should not be a close call. Compared to the 11th Circuit’s decision, other courts’ opinions on this subject are half-baked and muddled, reliant upon dubious generalizations that gloss over key historical materials. History, in its messy complexity, does not always provide a single correct answer. But here, it does. And the odds just shot up that the Supreme Court will reach it.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "If you’re looking for a snapshot of Bill Burr’s worldview, I recommend listening to the comedian’s wide-ranging interview he sat for on NPR’s Fresh Air last week. Burr was promoting his latest stand-up special, Drop Dead Years, which premiered on Hulu Friday, and within 15 minutes on NPR, he had already worked himself up into one of his vintage rages. The target of his ire was Elon Musk or, as he put it, the “select few group of nerds” with “dyed hair plugs and a laminated face” who are authoring the end of the American experiment. Burr, with his roughneck Boston accent, asserts that the ascendant tech oligarchy has successfully obfuscated its takeover thanks to the enfeebled preciousness of the liberal mainstream. What exactly does he mean by that? Somehow, he lands on the overreaches of the #MeToo movement: “You can get canceled as a comedian for doing a Caitlyn Jenner joke, but this asshole can Sieg Heil?” he says, referring to Musk’s eyebrow-raising inauguration Nazi salute. “Where are all of these white chicks at the award shows who were speaking truth to power? Why did they choose to go after comedians and not the Ku Klux Klan?”\n\nHis conjecture doesn’t make much sense; #MeToo was about sexual harassment in the workplace, not the confrontation of domestic terrorist organizations. This about sums up Burr’s politics: anti–conservative fascism, anti–liberal PC culture, somewhat incoherent, and always fueled by anger. The acrimony Burr summons, misplaced as it might be, is his comfort zone as a performer—and it’s why the comedian is currently experiencing something of a renaissance among left-leaning souls who are staring in disbelief at the massive losers who have overtaken the country.\n\nRelated From Slate I Spent a Day Looking Only at What Donald Trump Fans See Online. Sure Does Look Nice From Here. Read More\n\nLongtime fans of Burr will know that the man has stoked an antipathy for “woke culture” for as long as it’s been in his vocabulary. Before that, he dedicated vast swaths of his material to the haranguing of fat people, trans people, and, most commonly, feminists. A decade ago, I listened to him unveil a lengthy (and not very funny) monologue that, most charitably, could be interpreted as an ontological defense of Chris Brown’s assault of Rihanna. Stuff like that used to condemn you to the reactionary circuit, and yet, at a moment when the Democratic mainstream is tilting away from the identity-driven bindings of the Obama era, Burr and his highly cancellable gestalt have never been hotter. Sure, maybe some of the details are a little messy, the edges a bit rough, but few comedians are tapping into the larger mood and big picture like Burr is right now. When a clip of Burr extolling the virtues of accused UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione went viral earlier this year, I was not surprised. “Free Luigi!” he declares to applause. Jimmy Kimmel laughs awkwardly: “Oh, we’re back to Luigi. OK.” Burr’s response: “I never left Luigi!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBurr’s current renaissance is not the result of a pivot on his part; if anything, it’s a sign of how much the popular culture has shifted around him, taking on a more populist sheen, sick of both politically correct niceties and billionaire worship. Burr’s superpower as a comedian has always been his ability to concoct a frothy exasperation that—when aimed in the correct direction—can have an exfoliating effect on the mind. The impact is most cathartic when Burr deploys that ability on the listless bourgeois. In one of my favorite stand-up bits ever, back in 2012, he asked a very simple question of Steve Jobs: What the fuck did that guy do? (“He told other people what to invent?”) After his recent Mangione apologia picked up steam, a 2017 clip from a Burr appearance on Conan resurfaced; riffing on Nestlé’s attempt to privatize American groundwater, Burr, in a Mangionean turn, asserted that the CEO of Nestlé should be “hunted down and shot.” (“This guy wants to own the rain!”) Another clip, from 2014, that likely won’t travel as far in liberal circles as the others have, sees Burr irritated at Michelle Obama. She had just debuted the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls to raise awareness of the kidnapping of 200 young women by the extremist group Boko Haram. Burr was beside himself: “I’m a stand-up comedian. What am I going to do to get those girls back? Why don’t you look across the dinner table? You see that guy? That’s the leader of the free world! Tell him to pick up the phone and call some Navy SEALs and solve it!”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s the same flavor of rage, meted out to different characters who all have one important thing in common: access to the levers of power, and thus the mantle for why the world is the way it is. Burr has long contended that he speaks for a sensible majority, and if anything, the Trump years have only provided more political grist for the fury mill. It also helps that the comedian is now the father of two young children, born in 2017 and 2020; that life event supplies the most prominent thread in Drop Dead Years. The comedian has a newfound investment in the Earth and those he occupies it with, a feeling that manifests most acutely in the segments when Burr sheds the hard corners of his persona and cops to the conditions of his ignorance. “Men aren’t allowed to be sad. We’re allowed to be mad or fine, that’s it,” he notes, riffing on the limited scope of emotions he’s allowed himself to experience. Minutes later, he admits he suffers from depression—familiar territory in stand-up, but downright revelatory coming from someone who has structured an act on his own righteous defiance. It’s one of the few moments onstage when Burr exposes himself to esoteric forces of the subconscious or, more flatly, the possibility that he doesn’t know everything and he might not always be right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There are a lot of sad men. I know that now that I know how fucked-up I am,” he says. “Ladies, you’re probably married to a sad guy right now. That’s what the garage is for.”\n\nDeeper in that NPR interview, Burr expanded on the roots of his discontent. He grew up in an abusive household that, he said, saddled him with lifelong anger-management issues. This was all apparently clarified by a recent experience he had with psilocybin mushrooms, which allowed Burr to plumb the depths of his soul. (“I started tripping, and this feeling came over me. It was this profound sense of loneliness. … This [was] how I felt growing up, and it blew my mind.”) The vulnerability, the softness, the willingness to introduce a woo-woo West Coast treatment to his hard-nosed East Coast demeanor: I was almost startled to find that Burr is actually beginning to sound more and more like a liberal in ways that go beyond his concerns for the future of democracy. Unlike other comics forged in his mold—guys like Tony Hinchcliffe, who stick to exactly one note of confrontational, antagonistic MAGA-courting material—Burr demonstrates a willingness to grow, and that has, in turn, made him a better writer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat transformation will continue to clash against some of the thornier elements of his act. Toward the end of Drop Dead Years, he deploys a gnarly anti-gay slur to express the ways in which he’d like to see this country’s neo-Nazis be emasculated. (“I was worried I was getting too preachy,” Burr demurs in the punch line.) That instinct, the desire to provoke, is intractable for most comedians, especially those who have grown exceedingly protective of the words they’re allowed to use, and especially for someone like Burr, who is so allergic to partisan lines. It almost comes off like a challenge to the millennial liberal orthodoxy that might be watching: If you want Bill Burr on your side, you must also be willing to stomach his more prickly tangents—no matter how they might make you feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether you like it or not, a lot of people in America relate to Burr’s disposition. Can you imagine an American voter who holds some, shall we say, problematic views on pronoun policing or the #MeToo movement, while also harboring a very material sympathy for Luigi Mangione? Someone who is anti-woke but believes that the housing crisis has gotten out of hand? Of course you can—they are legion. They crowd Facebook walls and Instagram feeds, they are invited to our living rooms for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and they are also the exact type of citizen that has been legislated out of the Democratic Party. Bill Burr is their avatar, and the question becomes whether the next phase of liberal culture—for better or worse—will be shaped in his image, one primal scream at a time.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "This essay was adapted from the parenting newsletter the Pomegranate. Subscribe here.\n\nWhen my son was about 2, we brought him to a beer garden in D.C. that turned out to have a working historic fountain right in the middle. In my bag, I’d brought several Hot Wheels cars, as I did for most outings at that age, and almost immediately he began driving the cars up and over the low sides of the fountain, then driving them out again, and running their wheels over the hot concrete to make tire tracks. He was wildly entertained by this, and my husband and I were happy: We were able to chat with our friends and drink a beer while he played car wash. It was a win-win.\n\nBut then another family with young kids showed up, two daughters, the younger one a little older than my 2-year-old. Her eyes grew wide as she watched my son running his cars in and out of the fountain. She tugged on her dad’s arm.\n\n“Can I play too?” she asked.\n\nThe dad looked at my son, splashing away in the historic fountain, and scowled.\n\n“No, we don’t play in fountains,” he said, and quickly pulled her away.\n\nUp until that moment, it hadn’t occurred to me I’d done anything wrong. My son was having fun in the fountain, and yes, he was splashing water out of the fountain a bit, and yes, the fountain was maybe a little dirty, and now that I really paid attention, he was kind of getting in people’s space a bit as he wheeled the wet car around the concrete patio. But none of that had really felt like a problem to me until the other parent told his kid it was the wrong thing to do.\n\nSuddenly, I felt bad. The truth was, I hadn’t been out much with my 2-year-old in public spaces like this. He was born in May 2020, and visiting a beer garden was a relatively new experience for parents who had become parents in a pandemic. Was I doing something wrong? I felt as if we’d broken a rule I didn’t know existed. Of course “we” don’t play in fountains. It’s in the handbook. Except I never got a handbook. I just got a baby and, later, a lot of Hot Wheels cars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the next few years, it became clear that I am, indeed, the problem. Everywhere I go, my kids—I now have two, and they’re 2 and 4 years old—seem to be the wildest kids there. At the neighborhood barbecue, my kids dash around a neighbor’s yard, in and out of people’s legs, grabbing food off the table, giggling and trying to get inside to see the owners’ cat. At the grocery store, my son likes to pretend the grocery cart is a train; he stands on low shelves and jumps aboard as I go past. And yes, even at restaurants, I let them get up and roam around a bit. They’ve tried to get into the kitchen only, like, once.\n\nI notice, much of the time, that we are the only family doing these things. I see other toddlers strapped into a grocery cart, happily watching Disney+ on a tablet or phone, staying in a high chair calmly, or holding their mother’s hand. I don’t see a lot of other toddlers pretending to be a frog and hopping their way down the aisle of pews at the National Cathedral, like my 2-year-old did recently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a while after the fountain incident, I felt self-conscious about this. And sometimes I still do. Why are my kids so wild? I don’t think they are badly behaved. They’re not rude, they’re not pushing people or breaking stuff, and they’re certainly not knocking other kids down. But they are absolutely full of energy in a way that often feels way out of proportion to a lot of other kids I see in public. They’re always talking, always moving, always jumping.\n\nI’ve been witness to rounds of online arguments about what kids should be allowed to do in public and where they should be allowed to do it. Should kids be allowed in restaurants? Airplanes? Libraries? So many times I’ve found myself, and other like-minded parents, saying things like “How are they supposed to learn to behave in public if we don’t teach them to behave in public?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut part of me wants to say: Why do they always have to “behave” in public?\n\nHere’s where it’s going to get a bit controversial. I realized not long after the fountain incident that I don’t really care that my kids are kind of wild in public. I even kind of like it. I like that they are full of energy and ideas and curiosity. I like that they can make anything, even a trip to Costco, into a game. They’re smart and funny and silly and full of life in a way that makes me proud to be the mom of the wild kids. (I do realize that since my children and I are white, we have the privilege of mostly only worrying about what someone might think of us, not what actions may be taken against us. I understand not everyone has that luxury, although they should.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, it’s not as if I’m letting my kids run circles around restaurants where hot food is being brought out on a platter, but somewhere like a sandwich place? When it’s pretty empty? Guilty. As long as nobody is in immediate danger and we clean up after ourselves, I just don’t really care if my kids are acting like … well, kids. I don’t feel as if I need to constantly be “preparing my kids for the world,” because it’s their world as well. They’re here! They’re living in it. Our world is not an adult world we are training kids to participate in—it belongs to them too.\n\nAnd I want my kids to see beauty in it, to see possibility. I don’t think every outing needs to be a learning opportunity for how to sit nicely at a restaurant booth or how to stay quiet on the Metro. Sometimes I want the lesson that I’m teaching them to be that the world outside their house can be fun. Often they are matching my energy, and that of my husband, who’s been known to belt out a tune in public on many occasions. We are extroverts who like public spaces, and we’re bringing up our kids to be that way too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople are going to be mad about this. They will say I’m being selfish or disrespectful. Some will say I’m one of those parents who think my “little darlings” can do no wrong. (They actually do so much stuff wrong, though. Have you ever seen a 4-year-old try to simply drink from a public water fountain?) How many times have I had someone on Twitter yell at me and say that children shouldn’t be allowed to even set foot in a restaurant unless they are strapped to the table with a bungee cord because every server there is 10 seconds away from dumping hot queso and a pile of knives on their heads if they so much as move a muscle?\n\nBut I find, in the real world, that usually the worst thing that could actually happen is that a person has to eat lunch next to a kid who is performing a series of relay races on the restaurant patio or has to take a bus ride next to a kid who is singing “The Wheels on the Bus” while on the actual bus. And in the real world, perhaps some people are complaining about us privately, but I find that many people actually enjoy watching kids have fun. We typically get a lot of smiles when we are playing or singing or jumping around out in public, and more often than not, an older lady will stop me on the street to tell me how much she misses having little kids. I don’t know that this would happen if I weren’t willing to let my kids drive the tiny Trader Joe’s shopping cart around the store at high speed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other day I saw a woman in the grocery store with a baby and two older boys who looked about 3 and 5, respectively. Her two older boys were so well behaved that they walked quietly next to her while holding the sides of the cart. For a second I felt envy. Not only were they being so mild-mannered, but she seemed so confident. Nothing like me at the grocery store with my two kids. By the time we make it to the register, I’m usually sucked into a game of some sort—hide-and-seek or pretending to be a family of cats—or throwing them over my shoulders. It’s absolute chaos every single time. It makes my heart race and spikes my cortisol so high I usually need to take a few deep breaths when I finally do wrangle them back into their car seats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wonder about the calmer kids I see in public, the moms like the one in the grocery store who seem to be able to keep their kids at bay so much better than I do. Are they doing it because they don’t enjoy the cortisol rush (understandable), or is there something else at play? I wonder sometimes if other parents, the first time they took their 2-year-old out in public and let them play in a fountain, got the same reaction I did but pivoted the other way and never let them play in a fountain again. I wonder if the fountain shamer thinks his kids shouldn’t play in fountains only because someone once did it to him too. I wonder if we are all scared of being perceived as the problem more than we believe there really is a problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s no secret that our country doesn’t really like children. Just look at any public restroom, where the sinks are too high for them to reach, or our country’s lack of guaranteed maternity leave. But as long as my kids aren’t hurting anyone or setting anything on fire, I don’t feel as if I should have to make them behave in a specific way just because it’s someone else’s standard.\n\nUltimately, I think allowing my kids to be a bit wild in public is giving them confidence they can’t get at home. I’m proud that they feel as if they can run around in a stranger’s yard and grab Chex Mix off the table instead of hiding behind my legs. I’m proud they think it’s fun to hop like a frog in a national place of worship. I’m proud of my wild kids, whose minds and bodies are always running at top speed. But yeah, I will remove them from the roof if things start to really go down. I’m not insane.",

Submit it here or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI am not a parent, but this advice column was recommended to me by a friend who’s a mom. I’m 34 years old and found out I was pregnant a few days ago.\n\nI absolutely do NOT want to have kids, ever. I’ve been using birth control pills, but I know they’re not always 100 percent. When I saw the test, my husband and I both immediately knew I needed to schedule an abortion (luckily, I live in a state where reproductive healthcare is very easy to access). I have the procedure scheduled in a week.\n\nHere’s the problem: My mother has a pattern of violating boundaries. I don’t know why, but the next time I saw her, I blurted out that I was panicked because of the positive test. I was crying and really stressed, and her response was … not great. She hugged me and told me congratulations and immediately started giving me parenting advice. I told her there was no way in hell I was continuing the pregnancy. Since then, she will not stop calling me and texting me, trying to convince me to keep it. My mother was extremely abusive (we had CPS show up multiple times when I was young), and I do not want to repeat those patterns. I have PTSD and am in treatment for it from my childhood experiences. She keeps talking about how she was single, poor, very young, and unprepared to have me, but she’s “so happy” she did it anyway. I finally blew a gasket and basically told her, “You keep telling me about why YOU are happy and how it gave YOU a purpose, but have you ever thought about how your lack of preparedness affected me?”\n\nI told her that her line of reasoning was extremely selfish and that she was more focused on her feelings and wants than the safety and wellbeing of her children and theoretical grandchildren, and I wasn’t going to do that in my own life. I ended the conversation by saying even if I had the best childhood ever, this is my life and decision, as ultimately the burden of parenthood would be on me and my husband, no one else. She absolutely freaked out, called me names, and tried to call and text so many times I had to block her from my phone. My question is: Was I too harsh on her? Should I apologize? Or is this even a relationship worth maintaining? This whole ordeal has stressed me out to the point of not eating or sleeping. I know I shouldn’t have told her, but it was just a moment of panic. I really just never want to talk about this with her ever again. And is there a way for me to set some boundaries around my privacy? This has all made me realize maybe she has way too much information about my life, and I don’t think she’s earned a super-close relationship with me.\n\n—No Kids Wanted\n\nDear No Kids Wanted,\n\nI know how incredibly polarizing the abortion topic is, so I’ll just start by saying that I believe every person with a uterus should have the right to do whatever they want with their body. However, the only opinion that should matter regarding this isn’t mine or your mom’s, but yours.\n\nThe way you handled your mom is fine with me because you kept it real. Could you have been a little softer? Perhaps, but I’m not going to fault you for having years of unresolved childhood trauma bubble to the surface in a heated moment.\n\nHowever, not eating or sleeping is a big problem. I think you should apologize for anything hurtful you may have said to help rid yourself of guilt, but in doing so, you also need to set clear and firm boundaries. You can say something along the lines of, “Mom, I’m sorry for being mean, but this is a really stressful situation for me. To be clear, I have no desire to be a mother, and I’m going through with the procedure—and if we’re going to have any relationship at all, I need you to respect that decision. I also do not want to talk about this ever again.”\n\nAt that point, you both will have a decision to make. She’ll either fall in line, and you can continue managing your complex relationship, or she’ll defy your wishes, which means you’ll have to learn to love her from a distance. Either way, you shouldn’t be forced to maintain a relationship with anyone, blood-related or otherwise, who doesn’t respect how you choose to live your life.\n\n—Doyin\n\nMore Advice From Slate\n\nMy wife of more than 10 years has always been a bit of a nudist.

Submit questions here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy girlfriend moved in with me six months ago. We both have a dog and luckily, the dogs adore one another. However, despite my loving dogs, I don’t like them IN my bed. I don’t mind them on the bed but I don’t want them under the covers or on the fitted sheet. I make my bed every morning and have a blanket I put on the bed that the dogs can lay on so that dog hair doesn’t get onto the blankets I sleep on.\n\nRecently, my girlfriend got a new job and doesn’t have to be up as early as I am, so she is still in bed when I leave for work, and I can’t make the bed anymore. I asked her to make the bed and explained why it is important to me to get in bed and not have pet hair on my pillow but she still won’t do it. Worse, her job is hybrid and when she works from home, she sometimes just works in the bed, with both dogs cuddled against her while she eats and drinks, getting crumbs everywhere.\n\nI have begged and pleaded as much as I can and finally just started sleeping in the spare bedroom, where I can make the bed every morning before I leave for work and don’t have to sleep with dog hair and food crumbs. My girlfriend is understandably upset and said I am being too rigid, not making her feel “at home,” and acting like it is still just “my house.” But I would feel like this even if we had moved into a new place together.\n\nI want to ask her to move out. I own the house, she isn’t paying toward the mortgage and is only paying a small percentage of the utilities and HOA fees. It won’t be difficult for her to find another place to live that she can afford. However, if I do this, I don’t think there is any way to salvage the relationship, right? Things were great before we moved in together and I’d like to go back to that, but knowing that we can’t live together is probably the end of the relationship because we’d both eventually like to be married (although neither of us wants kids). Is there a way to go backward?\n\n—Is This the End?\n\nDear End,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou’re doing something that I love to do in relationships, which is to try to game out the end when one part isn’t working. But many, many possibilities can occur between Points A and B here, and I think they’re worth investigating.\n\nIt’s time to have an honest conversation with your girlfriend about the real issues at hand, which aren’t limited to just the matter of the bed. For one thing, you need to have a long talk about the logistics of sharing a home, since it sounds like you sort of resent the fact that she doesn’t contribute much financially toward the house itself. I’m not sure if you just didn’t have this conversation before she moved in, or if the agreed-upon arrangement simply no longer works for you, but either way, you need to come together on a new agreement about how this will work. You should discuss ways you can both make her feel more at home—and agree on common ground rules. Just asking her to change her habits, without talking about the greater growing pains of joining your lives together, will just drive this wedge further.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s likely been hard on your partner to feel like this is truly a shared home if you’re calling it “my house” and subconsciously making her feel like a freeloading tenant. That’s not a fun dynamic; it’s often why couples decide to move into a new place together, where neither person has a bigger stake in the place than the other. (It’s also why I do think your girlfriend is right; the dynamic would be slightly different if you were dealing with a brand new place that you could both call “ours”).\n\nIf you’re pretty set on having your girlfriend move out, here’s how you should pitch it to her. Tell her that you think the dynamic of her living in “your” place is not good for either of you. Explain that you’d like to take some time to work on the relationship and iron a few things out before you both take the step and find a new place for the two of you, where you’ll both feel equally comfortable. Frame this move-out as a temporary solution that is in service of a better future arrangement for everyone involved. Of course, there’s no guaranteeing she’ll take this well—and it won’t mark the end of your relationship. You’ll have to weigh that risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf she agrees to your plan, once you’re living separately again, you can take the time to talk through the issues that came up during this period from a greater degree of distance and objectivity. Talk about your standards for hygiene and the bed thing. Use these conversations as a way to practice communicating your needs and coming up with solutions together, from a more convenient, “safer” theoretical standpoint. Perhaps, over the course of these conversations, you’ll figure out that living together might not be workable after all. Or you actually might figure out how to better compromise and cohabitate. It’s hard to work on those skills at the same time, which is why this move-out period might actually be better for your relationship in the long run.\n\nGet advice from Prudie—submit a question!

We are extremely fond of Steven. He is kind, hard-working, enormously respectful, and genuinely devoted to our daughter. The problem is that Steven is an ardent Trump supporter. My husband, my daughter, and I are die-hard liberals and horrified by all that is happening politically right now. We understand Steven’s viewpoint. He is an active-duty military officer from a very different background. He’s always been respectful of our point of view and we generally avoid talking politics. But he is increasingly fixated on Fox News and various extremist MAGA commentators as being the truth and now doesn’t believe there is another point of view. Our daughter is incredibly distraught.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have essentially agreed to disagree. Steven claims that my daughter’s more privileged and sheltered life precludes her from understanding current realities, especially those he has seen firsthand in numerous combat situations. My daughter is weighing her options and is discussing this with me in depth. Among her concerns is that Steven is dealing with various combat-related medical issues and frankly would be devastated, if not destroyed, if she were to leave. She loves him and he absolutely adores her. She is asking for my help. She knows regardless of what she decides her dad and I will always support her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is a part of me that feels overwhelmingly sorry for Steven. I want to help him see the light. I want to do what I can to help keep their marriage viable. I’m encouraging my daughter to seek local counseling and also to find moments where she can openly share her political views and serious concerns with Steven. He often seeks my opinion and advice on work-related and family issues. In the run-up to the election, I sent him occasional hard facts and non-opinion pieces pointing out Trump’s lies and criminal undertakings but clearly, this had no impact. Can you recommend a succinct, serious eye-opening article or statement by someone not clearly liberal that he might consider? Any other suggestions are welcomed.\n\n—A Very Sad and Worried Mama\n\nDear Worried Mama,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, there is no “magic bullet” article that will convince someone to change their views overnight. A belief system is a thorny, complex thing that arises from a lifetime of experience and influences. While you may not agree with the particulars of that system, you do have to respect its deep-rooted existence—as well as the function it plays in giving Steven a sense of safety and identity (the same way your belief system gives you yours). Frankly, I think involving yourself in your daughter’s marital troubles by sending articles to Steven in hopes of changing his mind is meddlesome and insulting to Steven; if nothing else, it is definitely complicating the fact that your daughter and Steven have to work their differences out on their own. No one likes to feel ganged up on in a marriage.\n\nThe truth is that very few belief systems are easily swayed by rational appeal, no matter how elegantly you argue your point. You’re better off using your time and energy being a supportive mother to your daughter as she wrestles with her reservations, and in being as kind and respectful of a mother-in-law as you can be to Steven in the meantime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend Us Your Questions About the Workplace!\n\nThe columnists behind our advice column, Good Job, want to help you navigate your social dynamics at work. Does your colleague constantly bug you after hours? Has an ill-advised work romance gone awry? Ask us your question here!\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI can’t have biological children. About a decade ago, in graduate school, a classmate learned this and decided to treat me like her therapist as she struggled with infertility. I was uncomfortable because I hardly knew her when she started this but I tried to be supportive, which she regularly said I was. When she got pregnant, she invited all of the women from our program to the baby shower except for me—even people I heard her regularly speak poorly of. It was hard not to imagine the exclusion as anything but intentional. (For what it’s worth, I responded to her announcement with excitement and happiness for her. Also, not everyone invited to the shower had kids, so that couldn’t be a factor.)\n\nSince then, this has been a pattern. Women in my social circles, unconnected to my graduate school friends, who regularly invited me to events they hosted before their pregnancy have not invited me to their baby showers. I am frequently the only person excluded. I don’t talk a lot about my medical condition but it’s also not a secret. I always respond with genuine excitement and happiness when they announce their pregnancies. Now a very close friend is expecting. She’s discussed her shower around me, so I assumed I would be invited (though I didn’t say anything) but about two weeks ago, she mentioned mailing invitations. I have not received an invitation and she lives nearby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am at a loss for why this keeps happening. I know that I’m the common denominator in this, so I must be doing something that is making all of these women decide that they don’t want me at their baby shower but I can’t figure out what it is. I have made peace with my medical condition to the point that other people announcing their pregnancy genuinely only evokes joy and excitement for them. I’ve been told I don’t talk about my condition too much and I’ve certainly never mentioned it when someone was talking about their pregnancy. I genuinely don’t know what I’m doing wrong.\n\n—Infertile and Uninvited\n\nDear Uninvited,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don’t think you’re doing anything wrong. There may be a range of motivations at work: Worst-case scenario, it’s possible some of these women might have been “using” you as a confidante and are the type of people who are quick to discard a friend when that friend is no longer useful. But it’s more likely that most of these women feel awkward and embarrassed about how their situation compares to yours, and they’re afraid that inviting you to a baby shower or celebration would be offensive or upsetting. (Another reason behind those missing invites, which is more selfish on their end: Seeing you at the celebration might make them feel badly about their ability to have children.) My point is, fertility and pregnancy are such fraught, personal issues, that it’s inevitable people will handle them clumsily. They’re afraid of making it weird, and they’re afraid to be direct with you about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, it is on you to make it clear that you’d like to be invited to these kinds of events, and to also communicate your hurt when you have been left out. In the case of this particular friend, you could feign ignorance, “I haven’t received the baby shower invite in the mail yet, just want to make sure I didn’t miss it!” There is some small chance that some mix up did happen—and if it was purposeful, by asking her directly about it, you’re expressing your desire to be there.\n\nIf you get left out in the future, I would frame that kind of conversation along the lines of, “I saw that you had a baby shower, and I felt upset that I wasn’t invited. I think people assume that I don’t want to come to these kinds of things, but I would have loved to celebrate this with you and your friends.” Be calm and clear, not accusatory: Treat it as an unfortunate misunderstanding or miscommunication. (You can even use a bit of humor—“Hey, just because I’m not doing all that doesn’t mean I can’t be happy for you!”) But observe their reactions closely. If they’re defensive or dismissive of your hurt feelings, these are not friends worth holding onto. The good ones will apologize profusely and admit that they weren’t sure how to include you; with those ones, you can work together to figure out how to celebrate their big news in a way that works for everyone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI recently sold my customer-centered business after 30 years and am finally retired after five decades of working. I want nothing more than to be alone with my dogs, read a book, and garden. I want to clean my house! My friends are constantly hammering me to get out. I want none of that. I pleased people for 50 years and if I don’t see another human for a few months, I’m good. How do I stop their constant prodding without being rude?\n\n—Finally alone and Loving It\n\nDear Alone,\n\nYour friends probably miss you! Tell them that you need a few months to fully recharge and enjoy your solitude, but that you’ll call them when it starts getting cold again. They’re probably worried about whether you’re lonely, so you could offer to send them a monthly update (a photo or an email, for example) to keep them posted. If you’ve communicated all this and they’re still bugging you, feel free to start ignoring those calls.\n\n—Delia\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy husband and I had our first child in March of 2022 and my mother-in-law came to stay with us for two weeks almost immediately after we came home from the hospital (literally arrived two days after we got home).

The WallStreetBets subreddit that came to prominence during the 2021 GameStop moment is a digital watering hole for people who think they can make a buck whether the markets are going up or down. Things have not been happy at WSB, as any scroll through the most-upvoted posts of the past month would reveal. In viral posts, people are calling themselves slurs for not selling put options (thereby profiting off market downturns) at the right moment. They’re posting screenshots of the thousands of dollars they’ve laid on the line in options trades (something they’re not alone in doing right now). Some are throwing themselves forward as cautionary tales, like the person whose $560,000 portfolio three months ago had become a $270,000 portfolio by last week. (The market as a whole isn’t down nearly that much.)\n\nWallStreetBets is extreme, but in most any financial subreddit, you’ll find fear and regret as Donald Trump throws markets into chaos. “Feeling the heat today,” someone posted in r/investing. “What’s the plan overall?” In r/stocks, yet another investing subreddit, one person wrote, “I told my parents to buy near peak and now I feel terrible.” He elaborated: “I just wanted to write this some where cause I feel like a clown right now. I should have told them to wait with how Trump is imposing tariffs everywhere.” These are among the most popular posts on forums with millions of users apiece. Most of the time in the past few years, the people who have flocked to these spaces have celebrated wins with each other. Now they’re processing losses, at least most of the time. (The roller coaster also goes up some days, as it did when the S&P 500 improved by 2 percent on Friday. Now we await the next elevation change.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn these perilous times, one online community is a port in the storm, full of members who were built for this moment and are now (mostly) flexing their muscles as they ride it out. They call themselves “Bogleheads,” and they stand up as proof that getting financial advice from strangers on the internet is not automatically as grimy as it sounds. That is because the Bogleheads’ entire ethos is that you, a regular person on the internet, should not assume you know much about the stock market. By acknowledging your own lack of special knowledge or skill, you can profit. As the market goes on a roller coaster, every investment banker and financial analyst in the world has an opinion about how you should react. The Bogleheads’ message is much simpler and very likely the best you can do given the information available: Just chill, and trust that if you have money in the stock market, your money will eventually grow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bogleheads are not new. They have been around since 1998, when some Vanguard retail investors started posting with each other on a message board. They are disciples of Vanguard founder John Bogle, a pioneer of index fund investing who believed in (and profited from) the idea that most investors would be best off if they never tried to pick individual stocks and instead placed their investments in low-cost index funds that tracked the whole stock market. Some die-hards have had their own message board since 2007. A few of them wrote a book—Bogle penned the foreword—around the same time. Lately, though, the Bogleheads have seen their ranks swell. The r/bogleheads subreddit had fewer than 20,000 subscribers at the onset of the pandemic. It remains a niche community but is up to 628,000 members now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat’s major growth, but nothing like what WallStreetBets has seen in the same period. The past five years, after all, have been good ones to not be a Boglehead. The Boglehead approach of buying market-matching index funds has done quite well. The Vanguard Total Market Index Fund is a popular Boglehead pick, offering retail investors the chance to own a little piece of all of the world’s big public companies for almost nothing in fees. VTI has grown 104 percent the past five years, which is nice—but it’s not Bitcoin, which has grown nearly 1,300 percent in the same span. When the market is good and highly speculative investments are doing well, it’s not sexy to follow Bogle’s path.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTimes have changed. Being a Boglehead of late hasn’t been fun; nobody enjoys a stock market decline of 10 percent. But it’s been quite a bit more fun to lose that much, purely on paper, than to be a WallStreetBets cautionary tale drowning in a sea of doomed options trades or a Tesla investor losing 30 percent and wondering if your prized stock will go into the tank forever because of Elon Musk. Bogleheads have lost on Tesla too, but Tesla makes up just 1.39 percent of VTI. Most other companies you’ve heard of make up much less than that. When things are bad, it’s nice to be diversified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate Why Elon Musk Is Attacking a Website That Used to Adore Him Read More\n\nThe Boglehead subreddit reflects this feeling. There have been many panickers who have wandered into the forum to express their doubts or seek validation for doing the least Boglehead thing of all: selling stocks in a downturn rather than continuing to buy them. But the market correction has mostly served as a weed-out class for Bogleheads who weren’t really up to the Bogle ideology. The subreddit’s top post of the last week is one castigating the heretics: “The amount of people not staying the course, not continuing to invest, looking at their balance every day, and general hysteria is comical.” The Boglehead ideology abhors selling stock in response to a downturn, because it holds that none of us know when the market will go up or down. We only know that the line graph of the total stock market over the decades has gone up and to the right, and so investing in regular intervals and not pulling out in a bad month is the best we can do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Sometimes people ask, ‘That’s it? You buy a couple of index funds and then do nothing for 20 years? What’s the point of this subreddit?’ ” one Boglehead told their compatriots last week. “This. This is the point.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have joined the Bogleheads over the past few years. I cut ties with my financial adviser, even though he was a nice guy, because the Bogleheads impressed upon me two key facts: Most financial professionals do not beat the stock market with any reliability, and all of them cost money. I only buy broad-market index funds, which are excellent for both cost and time management. I lack the expertise to pick individual stocks or the appetite to wade into options trading, and knowing that my stock holdings are more or less an exact match for what the entire stock market is doing brings tremendous peace of mind.\n\nThis description somewhat flattens the Boglehead way of doing business. Ask 20 people how much of a Boglehead’s portfolio should be in international stocks or bonds, and you’ll get 20 different answers. But the group’s overarching worldview is the safest bet for both the financial and mental health of anyone who’s interested in having a comfortable retirement: Invest what you can in broad funds that cost very little money. Keep doing it, and only sell when you have a better reason than discomfort with how the market has changed over the past few weeks or months or even years. While American democracy dangles by a thread and the stock market has a horrible time, I draw comfort from knowing my financial fortunes aren’t any better or worse than most other people’s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this is very exciting, which could limit the Bogleheads’ long-term prospects for growth. Seth Rogen will not star in a movie about the Boglehead subreddit, because checking one’s brokerage account a few times a month and setting up automated transfers to buy index funds is just not as cool as formulating an attack on short-selling hedge funds to boost a flailing video game retailer. In times when the stock market is good, being a Boglehead is great, but it’s not cool. In times when the stock market is bad, though, being a Boglehead is better than doing the worst thing of all: panicking.",

First, immigrant authorities deported Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist at Brown University, despite a judge’s Friday order halting her removal. Second, authorities deported about 250 Venezuelan migrants, flouting another judge’s explicit directive to turn around American planes that hadn’t yet landed in El Salvador, where the migrants were being sent. The Justice Department claimed that it could not comply with the order barring Alawieh’s removal because it arrived too late. But the White House defended its defiance of the order prohibiting deportations of Venezuelans, insisting that the judge had no jurisdiction over the migrants—and that Trump holds absolute, unreviewable constitutional authority to expel noncitizens.\n\nTaken on their own, these claims would be chilling enough. But they were coupled with another novel late-night claim of presidential power: On Monday, Donald Trump purported to reverse President Joe Biden’s pardons of Jan. 6 committee members. In a Truth Social post that came just after midnight, Trump claimed the pardons are now “VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT,” asserting the power to undo their clemency because Biden allegedly signed it “by Autopen.” (It is the official position of the executive branch, unchallenged by the courts, that autopen qualifies as a valid presidential signature.)\n\nTaken together, these actions and declarations amount to a significant escalation in Trump’s transformation of his own presidency into an autocracy or, perhaps more accurately, a monarchy. His Justice Department has taken vague claims of “Article II authority” to new extremes, ascribing to him an unchecked right to expel immigrants with no semblance of due process—and as his defenders have asserted all weekend, to ignore lawful court orders that stand in his way. Meanwhile, Trump himself has made it clear that this extreme and dangerous new vision of executive power does not apply to the presidency, but only his presidency: It is not a set of neutral principles, but an ever-evolving pretext for his own personal whims and cruelties, dressed up in legalese concocted by the conservative legal movement for precisely this purpose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s clear by now that when the second Trump administration tests the limits of the law, it prefers to create enough chaos and confusion to cloud the true extent of its lawbreaking. That’s evidently what happened when it raced to expel Rasha Alawieh, a Lebanese immigrant who specializes in kidney transplants. Alawieh has a valid visa to work at Brown Medicine, but immigration officers detained her anyway on Thursday and began rapidly preparing for her removal. We still do not know the basis for this deportation.\n\nAlawieh’s lawyers asked a court to intervene, and Judge Leo Theodore Sorokin promptly barred her deportation in an order signed Friday. (Many of the relevant court documents are not available to the public.) But agents forced her out of the country anyway. Alawieh’s lawyers accused the government of “willfully” disobeying the court’s order, prompting Sorokin to demand an explanation. The Justice Department then averred that it did not notify customs officers at Boston’s airport quickly enough to stop Alawieh’s placement on a plane to Lebanon. The official explanation, then, is that the administration did not defy Sorokin’s order, but rather moved too fast for the judicial process to stop the deportation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate A Dangerous New Supreme Court Case Could Open the Door to Prosecutions for DEI Read More\n\nThe administration provided no such excuse for its deportation of Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador. Trump purported to expel these individuals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, accusing them (without clear evidence) of belonging to a gang. The American Civil Liberties Union went straight to court on Saturday, and at 6:52 p.m. that day, Judge James Boasberg ordered the administration to halt the deportations. From the bench, Boasberg declared: “Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States. … This is something you need to make sure is complied with immediately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis order was not complied with. Instead, as the ACLU has shown, migrant flights that were already “in the air” did not return to the U.S. According to Axios, administration officials debated whether to turn the planes around. They decided not to, “on advice of counsel,” who reportedly said “the order is not applicable” because “they were already outside U.S. airspace.” (That is not a remotely plausible reading of Boasberg’s order.) El Salvador’s president then tweeted a story about the court order with the comment “Oopsie … Too late,” which Secretary of State Marco Rubio retweeted. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later contended that the administration did not “refuse to comply,” but rather that the order “had no lawful basis” and was issued after the migrants “had already been removed from U.S. territory.” Again, as the ACLU has pointed out, Boasberg’s order expressly applied to migrants already en route to El Salvador. So the White House did, quite clearly, defy the order, on the grounds that it could unilaterally conclude its requirements were not “lawful.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that is sufficient reason to disobey a court ruling, then all judicial rulings are merely advisory, or just suggestions, and the three coequal branches of government have been replaced by an elected monarch. That might sound like an exaggeration, but it aligns with the Justice Department’s disturbing filings in this case. DOJ lawyers have argued that Trump does not even need the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order these deportations: Rather, he has an “inherent Article II authority to protect the nation” by determining that an immigrant “represents a significant risk to the United States” and “should be summarily removed from this country.” DOJ derives this claim to such alleged powers from the president’s “authority to repel” an “invasion” and “conduct foreign affairs” without judicial oversight. “Federal courts have no authority” to second-guess the executive’s declaration of an “invasion” or to hinder his response, government lawyers wrote, including the unilateral expulsion of migrants he personally dislikes. This sweeping power, DOJ has concluded, deprived Boasberg of jurisdiction over the migrants, rendering his orders null and void.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump’s astonishing claim of authority would render the other two branches of government purely advisory in the entire field of immigration enforcement. Congress’ decades of extensive legislation detailing which immigrants can be detained and deported, and under what circumstances, would amount to meager recommendations that the president could disregard. Under this construction of executive authority, court orders attempting to enforce those laws—or even bedrock constitutional protections—would be similarly voluntary. As Steve Vladeck has noted, no Supreme Court precedent remotely backs up this startling theory that Trump has “categorically unreviewable” power over foreign affairs that includes the right to identify, detain, and deport specific immigrants over judicial objections. The best support comes from a solo 2015 opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas that even Justice Antonin Scalia ridiculed as promoting “a presidency more reminiscent of George III than George Washington.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump capped off this weekend of lawlessness by announcing, in the early hours of Monday morning, that Biden’s preemptive pardons for Jan. 6 committee members are “void” because they were allegedly signed by autopen. This declaration rejects well-known, long-standing guidance from the Office of Legal Counsel (which the Justice Department has not yet withdrawn), and seems to be based on a conspiracy theory promoted by the Heritage Foundation. The reason these facially absurd autopen claims are so vitally important to the emerging theory of the imperial presidency is that they reveal precisely how cynical Trump’s view of boundless presidential power really is. These novel assertions of authority are not statements about presidential powers, but rather statements about Trump’s powers, which clearly apply to no other president. And the fact that DOJ lawyers are comfortable standing up before both federal judges and the American people to claim that Trump’s constitutional authority is without limit—whereas Biden’s was part of some ongoing criminal conspiracy and wholly illusory—shores up the notion that none of these claims attach to the office of the president, but that they inhere in fact in the person of Donald J. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those folks who have been waiting to climb the pole and ring the “constitutional crisis” bell, it would appear we have arrived. Neither Judge Sorokin nor Judge Boasberg believed that he was signing a meaningless order, and both judges demanded compliance that never came. We are long past the point at which courts have any reason to believe Trump’s lawyers when they use rhetorical tricks and deliberate misdirection to suggest that judicial orders were ambiguous or that compliance is inadvertently delayed in good faith. We are now at the place, only eight weeks into this presidency, at which judges must decide if they will take the necessary steps to enforce their decisions, including sanctions and contempt, or if they will agree to be made irrelevant. Those are the remaining options. And if the courts surrender now, the people will lose their last line of defense against an administration that wields Article II like a cheat code to subvert democracy.",

Submit your own questions to Prudie here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI have a 6-year-old dog that has mental problems. (Yes, really.) We have tried everything our vet has recommended over the past few years: training, over-the-counter meds, prescriptions, and treatment by a well-respected certified behavioralist. Unfortunately, she is not getting better. My own health is declining and I love her, but the subject of euthanizing her has come up at home and briefly in the vet’s office. Is this wrong? And if we decide to go down this path, am I obligated to be honest about why she was put down when relatives and friends ask?\n\n—Pet Euthanasia, and Can I Lie About It?\n\nDear Pet Euthanasia,\n\nAt the risk of inviting the “I hope you roast in hell “ letters, I will recap my own experience with my mentally deranged cat who we had to put down. I had a pair of feline littermates, Goldie and Biscuit. Biscuit is now a lovely elderly gentleman, but we had to put down Goldie at quite a young age because he was deeply disturbed. He urinated everywhere, howled all night long, and was a sad and miserable creature. We, too, did the medication and training route to no effect.\n\nI believe when you’ve done everything you can and your pet is living a hellish life and is making yours hell, the humane thing to do is to end it in a humane way. Sure, there will be people who say you have to rehome such a pet. However, there are few who want to take in an animal who will ruin their house and life. More often people turn in such pets to the pound, where they live terrified for a short time, then get put down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there is nothing left to do, and you make this choice, you shouldn’t feel guilty.

In the 16 years we’ve known each other, he has not been to the dentist once. As a child he had a traumatic injury to his front teeth, and that the repair was not done correctly. As a result, he does not smile and show his teeth, and he talks so that his teeth can not be seen. He does have a dark/discolored top front tooth. Due to his lack of regular dental visits, I am not interested in kissing him. He has extreme halitosis and I have mentioned this to him and he gets very upset and angry with me. I’ve told a couple friends about my ultimatum, they think getting divorced because of poor oral hygiene is ridiculous. What are your thoughts?\n\n—See a Dentist\n\nDear See a Dentist,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know what’s wrong with your husband. His mouth is a cesspool and he has extreme dental phobia. But you signed up for this 16 years ago, and I don’t understand how you married someone whose mouth reminds you of the portal to hell. Open-ended ultimatums aren’t really ultimatums. Your husband hasn’t seen the dentist, and now it’s almost July. His mouth prevents you from being intimate with him, and he won’t do anything about it. I suggest you do some research into dentists who specialize in treating the phobic. Tell your husband you will accompany him and that the biggest hurdle is just getting to the office. Your marriage does not hang on the results of a survey of your social circle—and these people have really relaxed standards. Your requirement that your husband meet a minimum threshold of hygiene is perfectly reasonable\n\n—E.Y.\n\nFrom: Hell Mouth. (June 30, 2014)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am in my late 30s and still keep in touch with good friends from high school. “Jim” and “Arlene” were married to each other right out of high school. Jim then cheated on Arlene while they were married with Arlene’s best friend “Maureen.” Arlene left Jim and he and Maureen got together, and while they never married stayed together for years. Needless to say Maureen was not thought of highly and many wished karma to take action on her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, just this year Maureen died after a long, horrible battle with cancer. Jim left Maureen while she was battling cancer because he “could not handle it.” Many people have been saying, well karma came and there it was, and I have to admit that I have thought the same thing.\n\nAs someone who personally has been cheated on, I have wished much worse on the cheater and the mistress. But is it wrong to feel that Maureen got what she deserved? I think people saying that are terrible but in the back of my mind I cannot truly disagree and I feel horrible for feeling that way.\n\n—When Karma Actually Happens\n\nDear Karma,\n\nYou’re old enough to have noticed that death comes to the cheater, the pure, the gossip. You’ve also probably observed that the idea of some tit for tat design behind it can be difficult to discern. (Although if there is karma, it will be a doozy for Jim.) Maureen betrayed her friend and helped cause the end of a marriage, then died young and agonizingly. I do not think these two events are related. Sure, the people who disliked Maureen may have felt she got what she deserved—but there should be a serious limit on this kind of crowing. I think when you hear such crowing you should say something like, “I’m not defending how Maureen treated Arlene, but I am sorry about her death.”\n\n—E.Y.\n\nFrom: What Goes Around.

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Dear Prudence is online weekly to chat live with readers. Here’s an edited transcript of this week’s chat.\n\nQ. Big Mother: My mother recently installed an indoor smart camera at our family cabin “for security,” and insists it is left on even when we’re there (i.e. just my husband and I or with my other siblings and their partners, friends, what have you). We all feel very uncomfortable with this, as none of us trust her not to spy on us or use it against us. She insists she’ll never look at it when we’re there and that we’re never to unplug it just in case, but just recently we were up and put a box over it (it has a 360-degree swivel so it’s not as simple as blocking it) and she lost it on us, and said I know who covered it, all but proving our fears that she is using it to spy on us… This feels so invasive and inappropriate, and borderline illegal. It has always been a family cottage that we’ve all shared but now we feel so uncomfortable. Help!\n\nA: If you’re a co-owner of the cabin, stand firm, continue to cover the camera, and let her lose it on you if she wants. If “family cottage that we’ve all shared” translates to “cottage that my parents own and let me use for free,” I’m afraid you’ll have to play by your mom’s rules or head on over to Airbnb.\n\nQ. Sick Breakup: Am I a horrible person for wanting to break up with my boyfriend now that he has a long COVID? My boyfriend and I have been dating for about six months and he got COVID about a month ago. Before that, he was always more into the relationship than I was. I realized shortly before he contracted COVID that there were some big choices he made in his life that I wouldn’t want in a long-term partner. After that point, I was fine with us being in a not-so-serious relationship until one of us wanted out, but I figured he probably wouldn’t want that. I was going to talk to him about this, but then he got COVID. He’s been struggling so much and I feel terrible for him. He hasn’t been up for much fun stuff and he has been leaning on me for help a lot more than before. He has friends he could ask but he keeps saying, “This is stuff a girlfriend is supposed to do.” If I didn’t have such a good support system, I think I’d be miserable. I just want out but that seems like I’d be kicking him when he’s down. To top it all off, he’s good friends with a good friend of mine, so I know this might cause a rift in that friend group. Is there any way I can break up with him without seeming like a horrible person?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: “Before that, he was always more into the relationship than I was” is all I needed to hear. You’re not breaking up with him because he has a long COVID, you’re breaking up with him because you were never that crazy about him. Not to mention, he’s placing weird gender-based demands on you and seems like a little bit of a jerk. People end relationships all the time. Get out ASAP and I promise you, the friend group will get over it.\n\nQ. The Silver Fox: I am dating a man who is 78 years old. He is cheerful, active, and really seems to get me. My mother is against me seeing him, saying he only sees me as a “trophy girlfriend” and an ego-booster. Prudence, I am 34, and I don’t feel that is too large of an age gap. What should I do?\n\nA: If you like it, I love it. Your mother may be totally right about how he feels, but you are completely grown up and get to make your own choices, and you’re happy. Remind her of that.\n\nQ. Domestically Challenged: I’m a 26-year-old person (they/them) with ADD. I struggle a lot with executive functioning; messy rooms, laundry piling up, dishes sitting out… (Due to my physical and mental health, I currently live at home.) I don’t like being messy, but no matter how hard I try I can’t get past that barrier. I have found over the years that I function best when I live with someone else; when I’ve lived alone for school the mess has been even worse, there’s been no structure to my days, and I’ve often ended up skipping meals (or filling up on snacks), whereas in a shared space I feel responsible for cooking a real meal for everyone and keeping to a schedule, and I feel bad if I let stuff pile up too much. Part of it is a division of labor—if I cook and someone else does the dishes, of course, the dishes get done—but part of it is just me needing external motivation. What I’m concerned about is this: If I ever have the means to move out, and if I end up living with a potential future partner, isn’t that unfair to them? Surely even someone who loves me won’t want to be responsible for making sure I behave like a functional adult? I feel an enormous amount of shame about my inability to handle this on my own, and I’m worried that it will sour any romantic relationship beyond repair. Will it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I think stigma around having ADD has made you feel like your challenges are somehow more shameful than those of people who don’t have a diagnosis. They’re not! Everyone brings their own stuff to a relationship, including some qualities that could be considered “unfair” to a partner. Student loan debt. Ailing parents. Seasonal affective disorder. Hair that falls out and clogs up the tub. Snoring. A person who wants to be in a relationship with you will do it because you’ve been honest about what it’s like to live with you and because they’ve decided the good qualities you bring to the table balance out your shortcomings. Be totally transparent about what you can and can’t do, what you’re working on (there probably are some strategies you could use, with the help of a counselor or coach), and what’s a permanent part of your life. And make sure you remember that you have strengths and delightful quirks, too (you didn’t list them but I’m sure you do). There’s more to being in a relationship than housekeeping.\n\nQ. Ballet: I’m a senior in high school. One thing that I’ve always loved is ballet. I love watching it and analyzing it, and I used to dance when I was very young. However, I had to be pulled out because I kept getting skin infections and lung problems. Even now, I still look back on that and I feel sick because of how much I wanted to continue. I remember crying in my parents’ arms when they told me I wouldn’t go back. I tried to forget it until two people came into my life. Both are incredibly skilled dancers, both with experience in ballet. So much so that one of them does it professionally, and the other is currently being recruited. Every single time they bring up their experiences I can’t help but feel some jealousy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI value both of them highly, one of them is my best friend. I would defend them to the moon and back! I can’t just go “Hey, whenever you bring up the fact you’re literally basically a pro in what was one of my dreams as a kid it kinda makes me feel like crawling in a sewer and getting eaten by a croc!” and ask them never to talk about it. They’re passionate about what they do, and I love that for them! I attend performances, compliment their dancing, and I will happily watch videos they show me about their skills. I just feel so terrible about being so jealous of something that will never come to fruition for me.\n\nI don’t want to go into ballet professionally anymore—and there is no possible way I could. From what I’ve seen, I don’t even have a chance to go en pointe. But still, seeing two close people in my life excel in something that I barely ever had a chance to do makes me almost want to mourn, and I don’t even know why. It’s been almost 10 years. How do I get over this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: Congratulations on handling the jealousy. Seriously. It says a lot about you that you’ve been such a good, supportive friend to these people who remind you so much of something you desperately want for yourself.\n\nNow listen carefully: Sign up for a ballet class! Your health is better now. You’re barely older than Misty Copeland was when she started! I’m not saying you’ll go pro—I believe you that you won’t. And I’ll take your word for it that you might not even go en pointe. But you love ballet and you can do ballet a few times a week if you want. You don’t have to keep getting better and better. You can just do as much ballet as your body allows, and enjoy it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen, and if, you feel like you’ve maxed out, I can see one of two scenarios happening: Either you shift to a different kind of dance (like modern, hip-hop, or tap that gives you a new challenge, a new group of people to learn with, and opportunities to perform) or you find a way to get involved in ballet in a different way. Could you teach toddlers? Or work at a dance summer camp? Or get a part-time job doing something on the administrative side for a studio or company? The opportunities are endless and I really believe your passion will lead you to something that’s a much better use of your time and energy than suppressing jealousy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris: That’s it for today, friends.

(It’s anonymous!)\n\nDear Pay Dirt,\n\nI got married too young to a jerk (serial cheater, financially controlling, refused to take a day off for my emergency surgery for a life-threatening issue or care for me after). A few years prior to the split, I agreed to polyamory because my husband said he couldn’t be monogamous. I started dating a friend long distance, “Cedar.” Cedar showed up for me emotionally during the health scare and, when I left my husband as soon as I was well enough to make arrangements, moved across the country to emotionally and physically (chores and errands, organizing my medications and medical appointments, cooking and cleaning) support me. In turn, I have financially supported them because I make more than enough for a household of two, with the plan for them to resume working outside the home once I’m more capable of sharing household labor.\n\nMy mom and my sister were full of I-told-you-so’s about my marriage when it ended—except they didn’t tell me so. They never let me talk about my personal life and always wanted to pass judgment without hearing out my side of things, so they knew next to nothing about my ex when we got married.\n\nNow they’re angry at me for dating and living with Cedar, even after I explained that we were together before my marriage ended. They insist that I need to “take time for myself” and “not just marry the next person who comes along.” They don’t want to hear about all the ways Cedar has been good for me throughout our six years of friendship, three years of long-distance dating, or six months of post-surgical/post-separation cohabitation. They certainly do not want to get to know Cedar, and ignore Cedar when I bring them to family functions. They also won’t let me talk about anything of interest to me, only how my focus on my health and life with my partner has made my sister feel we aren’t close anymore. I also suspect they are upset I won’t help my sister pay off some debts she accrued and that they blame Cedar for that financial boundary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that my divorce is final, I’m considering things I did not get the opportunity to do while young and married to a controlling man, including moving to another state. My mom and sister are hostile to that idea, especially since I am particularly interested in moving to Cedar’s home state. They won’t let me talk about the benefits of the move and my relationship, they only want me to listen to their reasons it is a bad idea: examples of friends who left one man, immediately married another, and ended up miserable (Cedar isn’t a man, they’re a nonbinary lesbian, and we aren’t engaged); the idea that I am being financially exploited (I’m not, I’m being taken care of in ways I value); and that I am “abandoning” my sister (she’s 36 with a career but few friends and no romantic partner). I am 38 years old and finally getting a chance to do the things I spent my 15-year marriage only dreaming about. How do I convince my family to let me make my own decisions and live in peace on the other coast?\n\n—Sister Under Siege\n\nDear Sister Under Siege,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere’s an easy solution here: Stop giving the discussion oxygen. You’re spending a lot of time and energy engaging with people on a topic that requires no explanation. None. At. All.\n\nHere’s how this plays out in real-time: You announce you’re moving in with Cedar to another state. Your family starts yapping about how terrible this is and how you’re falling into the same trap. Your response? “I’m sorry you feel that way.” Or, nothing. Just let them rant about it, as you stare blankly at them. If they don’t stop, your next move is, “Oops, I have to run.” And then you leave the room or hang up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou’re 38 years old. You don’t need your family’s permission to make your own decisions or move to another coast. You pay your own way and don’t require assistance. The fact that your sister doesn’t have friends isn’t your concern. You have your life. She has hers.

What can we do to prepare? I know generally some good ideas (like trying to pay off high-interest debt and creating an emergency fund).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, should I change anything about my investments? I’m in my late 30s, and I have a work 401(k) that I contribute to, as well as an individual IRA on my own that I don’t max out each year but drop extra cash in on occasion when I have it. I spent a chunk of my 20s traveling and moving around bartending, so I got started saving for retirement late and, therefore, definitely won’t have the recommended triple my salary in my retirement accounts in two years when I turn 40, but I have about double now (and have no regrets about adventuring while young before settling into a more regular career). I’ve heard different recommendations about the asset allocation of your retirement funds, such as the 110 rule where you subtract your age from 110 to see how much you should have in stocks versus bonds, but both because I started saving a little later and because I’m generally a fairly risk-tolerant person, I’ve pretty much left it at 90 percent stocks and 10 percent bonds so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now I’m wondering whether I should adjust that. If I were younger, I would be fine just letting things ride, but even after starting saving a little later, I’d still like to retire around the normal time, so that’s only about 25 more years for my investments to grow. While that’s still a lot of time, it’ll be a lot harder to do if most, if not all, of my progress to date is wiped out. So when do you know when to adjust your asset allocation, and how do you know by how much to do so?\n\n—A Sense of Impending Tariffs\n\nDear a Sense of Impending Tariffs,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are very confusing economic times. Almost every economist believes that tariffs are a bad idea, and will push the economy into a recession. So, you’re right to worry. I’m concerned, too. No one knows what the future will bring exactly, so it’s important to start where you are today. Paying off debt is a good start. So is saving more money.\n\nIf you assume that a recession is coming, the best thing to do now is tighten your belt, before you have to. Building up your emergency fund is crucial, so strip your budget down to bare bones, and plow everything into a high-yield savings account. Hopefully, you won’t lose your job in a downturn, but if you do, you’ll have built up a cushion to support you while you figure out how to land on your feet.\n\nYou’re 38, employed, and you’re steadily saving for retirement, most of which is in mutual funds. That’s great. While today’s market volatility is unnerving, you’re doing the right things: You’re saving regularly in your 401(k) and you’re staying invested, even during the scary times. Remember, when the market is down, keep contributing as much as you can. In any case, be sure to max out your 401(k) (or at least enough to get your employer contribution).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for your investment mix, you’re young enough to ride out any drastic downturns over the next few years, which is always the concern financial advisors have about an investor’s choice of investments. I’ve always invested for growth, and since you didn’t complain about a lack of sleep (and say you’re pretty risk-tolerant), I’m guessing you’re OK with that kind of investment strategy.\n\nAs you get older, and closer to retirement, you may want to add some more bonds or bond funds to the mix. That will give you a bit more balance. I-bonds provide a return that’s slightly higher than the rate of inflation and locks that in for the life of the bond. You can buy them yourself at TreasuryDirect.gov.

After the disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, it was easy to feel like it was gone for good. But “eliminated” means there was no ongoing local spread. It’s not the same as “eradicated.” With a few dozen cases popping up here and there each year, as soon as vaccination rates dip, the illness rears can rear its ugly head once more—just as it is right now.\n\nPeople have mostly forgotten how bad measles can be. In a world where vaccination rates are typically above 95 percent, it’s incredibly rare to see even a single hospitalization for the condition. But, now, as outbreaks spread, parents across the country are desperately looking for a way to protect their children from an infection with a fatality rate of around 1 in 1,000. That might sound low, but compare it to COVID-19 in 2020 in children age 5: It’s around 100 times more deadly. And for kids who survive measles, there can be other nasty complications. For example, there is evidence that for some kids measles permanently damages the immune system, leaving them more vulnerable to other diseases.\n\nThe obvious way to protect your family is simple: vaccination. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is one of the safest medical interventions we have and provides extremely good protection against the disease. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has suggested that vitamin A supplements are just as useful as vaccines. “Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality,” he wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. “Good nutrition remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses.”\n\nUnfortunately, the idea that good nutrition is a “best defense” simply isn’t true. You can eat a remarkably healthy diet and still become very ill. Vitamin A supplements do have some benefits—but they won’t protect your children from measles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, there is a grain of truth to the idea that vitamin A can be a useful tool when it comes to measles. The vitamin is a molecule that your body uses for a wide range of purposes. One of the main things that it does is help you mount an effective immune defense. We have known for decades that people with very low vitamin A levels are at much higher risk of suffering and dying from many infectious diseases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put it simply (in fact, perhaps too simply!): Vitamin A deficiency causes you to be particularly vulnerable to infectious disease, including measles. Correcting that deficiency solves this problem.\n\nThere are a number of studies from the ’80s and ’90s to back up this idea. A famous study found that a vitamin A supplement for children who were admitted to the hospital with measles reduced the risk of those kids dying by nearly 80 percent. A 2017 review that aggregated a range of trials together did not show a benefit for mortality, but did find that the vitamin reduced the risk of children having a diagnosed case of the disease.\n\nThese studies are why vitamin A supplementation is still recommended as a treatment for children who are hospitalized with measles. But the problem is that they don’t really have all that much relevance to children in the United States today. The famous study I mentioned above was conducted in 1987 in Cape Town in a mostly Black population at a time when the apartheid regime still held sway. The studies aggregated together in the 2017 review were mostly conducted in China, India, and Africa in the ’80s.\n\nIn most of these settings, vitamin A deficiency was not just common—it was ubiquitous. Some of these countries had deficiency rates above 20 percent. Meanwhile, the most recent and robust data we’ve got, from the ’90s, suggests that fewer than 1 in 100 children in the U.S. have a vitamin A deficiency. Some even more recent data puts the rates even lower, although that study was mostly looking at pregnant women. This is perhaps not surprising in a world where you can get enough vitamin A dining exclusively on the McDonald’s menu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also know that vitamin A supplements are unlikely to help kids who have enough vitamin A. For example, a massive 1990 study conducted in India showed that vitamin A supplements reduced the risk of kids dying from measles and other infectious diseases by more than half. However, all of this benefit was in children who showed very obvious signs of malnourishment, like stunted growth or skin clinging to their bones. Those kids had an 89 percent reduction in their risk of death. Children who were not malnourished had no reduction in risk at all.\n\nAlso, things are actually little more complicated than “If you have a vitamin A deficiency, a supplement can protect against measles.” One of the largest trials ever conducted—in over 1 million children—took place in northern India in the ’00s and calls that straightforward idea into question. In this region, vitamin A deficiency was very common. The study randomly allocated kids to either get a very high-dose vitamin A supplement or a placebo medication once every six months. At the end of the trial, death rates from measles and a variety of other diseases were the same, although the rate of vitamin A deficiency had dropped drastically in the supplement group. There was also no difference in the rate of diagnosed measles between vitamin A and a placebo in this massive trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis seems to conflict with the evidence from the ’80s and ’90s that was summarized in the 2017 review I discussed above, but if you look closer, it makes sense. While vitamin A deficiency was still quite common in India in the ’00s—the study found rates of 10–15 percent without supplementation—the situation was still much better than it was two decades earlier. (For example, a study in 1993 showed that rates of eye disease caused by vitamin A deficiency were 22 percent in Uttar Pradesh, where this large randomized trial was later conducted.) The point is that the more modern evidence does not seem to show as much benefit for vitamin A supplementation for measles (though there are benefits for other things). This could be because the rate of severe malnutrition has dropped globally since the first of these studies were conducted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s also worth noting that none of these studies have tested the sort of supplement that you can buy in a supermarket or pharmacy. Most store-bought vitamin A supplements have somewhere between 300 and 1,500 micrograms of the substance in them. The average amount used in these studies—which, remember, are of kids with severe deficiency—is about 30,000 micrograms. That’s between 20 and 100 times higher than your average multivitamin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you live in an area with severe malnutrition, where kids are literally starving on the streets, then a vitamin A supplement is probably a good way to reduce your child’s risk of extremely nasty disease. But if you live in the U.S., where fewer than 1 in 100 kids have low vitamin A levels and even fewer have a true deficiency, the supplements probably aren’t going to do very much.\n\nYes, your immune system can function better when you are not malnourished, but the best way to protect against measles is vaccination. Really, it’s not even an either/or proposition—feed your kids and also get them vaccinated. We got rid of the disease for 25 years. There’s no need to bring it back.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "“I just have this, like, effortless comfortability with him that, like, I just love,” a woman named Madison cooed on the latest season of Netflix’s Love Is Blind.\n\nThere are many reasons to be confused and repelled by this statement: For one thing, it was said through a wall, because that’s how this particular dating reality show works. Forget about that for a second, and also try to put aside any feelings you have about how people use the word like. That leaves us with comfortability, a word that many people insist isn’t a word at all. The man Madison was talking to, Mason, didn’t seem to mind—“I feel the same with you,” he said back—but some viewers at home took notice. On Reddit, one user said that if one more person on the show said comfortability, they would slap them: “That’s not a word!!!”\n\nI can relate. Sometime in the last year or so, comfortability zoomed past “I resonate with that” to the top of my list of linguistic pet peeves. I took note when Ariana Grande used my least favorite word in December, telling a French journalist, “I think, in today’s society, there’s a comfortability that we shouldn’t have, at all, commenting on others’ looks.” It’s all over the place in sports, too, where a headline might talk about a quarterback’s comfortability with his team’s playbook, or use it in reference to how a basketball player’s season is going. I hear it on TikTok and in podcasts too, but in truth the place I notice it more than anywhere else is on the lips of Madison and Mason’s compatriots on reality television. As in: “Marcus and I just have this connection and this natural comfortability to us,” The Bachelorette’s Jenn Tran said last summer. I’m not the only one to have picked up on this: In a December Vulture recap of an episode of yet another reality show, The Ultimatum, writer Laura Bradley commented that comfortability has become “inescapable” in the dating-show sphere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut all kinds of dumb things get said on reality TV. What’s so uncomfortable about this locution in particular, to me and, it turns out, lots of others?\n\n“It feels like such a ridiculous word to me,” said Dorian Stuber, an English professor at Hendrix College in Arkansas, who has noticed the dreaded C-word cropping up in his students’ writing over the past year. “I’m just like, What is this? Don’t we already have a perfectly good word that means this?” Stuber is referring to the word comfort, and this is a common knock on comfortability: that it adds unnecessary letters and syllables to a perfectly good word to create a new word that clunkily means the exact same thing as the original one.\n\n“It just sounds ugly, is the primary thing,” said Ashley Fairbanks, a writer and communications professional in San Antonio. Fairbanks said she was recently horrified to hear the word come out of her 13-year-old daughter’s mouth. “I definitely corrected it pretty blatantly when she said it, almost like she swore or something,” she said. “She told me she did not care at all about my opinion, but I haven’t heard her say it again.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe you haven’t encountered the word at all—this would be especially understandable if you’re not a reality TV watcher. Google’s Ngram Viewer, which tracks how common words and phrases are in books over time, shows that comfortability has seen a sharp increase over the last decade, but it’s still minuscule when you compare it to, say, comfort. Similarly, Google Trends shows an uptick in searches over that time, but the numbers remain relatively low.\n\nSo it’s not that it’s the most dominant language trend—it’s more that you’d think it was, the way it gets under word people’s skin. “I don’t want to be the person who judges language use,” Stuber told me. “But something about this word does kind of set me off a little. And so I’m interested in that about myself.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile I can’t deny that it has felt to me like comfortability entered the lexicon out of nowhere over the last few years, it has actually been around much longer than that—hundreds of years longer. For a recent radio segment for Michigan Public, University of Michigan professor Anne Curzan answered a listener who wrote in about the rise of comfortability. After pointing out that comfortability sounds less awkward out loud than it might initially look, thanks to people collapsing some of its syllables into “comf-tor-bil-i-ty,” Curzan explained that comfortable originally comes from French and has had its current meaning since the 1700s. For almost as long, its noun form has technically been comfortableness, which in Curzan’s view has a slightly different meaning than comfort. Where comfortability comes in can at least partly be attributed to some larger trends in suffix use over the last few hundred years—suffix trends, who knew!—whereby -ness has been losing out in popularity to -ity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat explains why someone might choose comfortability over comfortableness—but not why they’d choose it over comfort. Stuber said he’s tried to be open to the idea that there’s a good answer to that. “The grumpy part of me is like, Yeah, hello, we already have a good word. When I’m being more generous, I’m thinking, Well, maybe there is some need that is being addressed by the rise of this word.” He said he raised the question with his students, who offered mixed opinions. “One thing some student said to me was it is a word they might use in writing because it sounds fancy,” he said. “Other students were the opposite. They were like, ‘Oh my God, I would never use it in a paper. I use it maybe if I’m talking to friends or something.’ ”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Aleksic, a linguist who goes by @etymologynerd on TikTok and is the author of the forthcoming book Algospeak, wasn’t sure what people might be trying to communicate with comfortability, but its existence doesn’t bother him. As for why someone might use it over comfort and comfortableness, “I do think it kind of has its own vibe a little bit,” he said. He added that it’s hardly unprecedented for similar clusters of words to exist: “Indentation and dent both mean the exact same thing, but I would use them in different situations,” he said. He also pointed to extra and extraneous, and instant or instantaneous. “It’s very much a common etymological thing that we sometimes add extra what are called morphemes, or parts of a word, even when we don’t actually need to, and they don’t change much about the word,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we take seriously the idea that comfortability is filling a niche, one that comfort can’t fill, what is that niche? Nicole Holliday, a linguistics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, surmised that comfort is already doing a lot, as a word: It can be a noun, a verb, or an adjective, and people might bypass it for that reason, racking their brains for a word that feels more definitively like a noun. It made sense to her that people might want different words for, say, “the comfort of the 3-point line” versus “the comfort from your cozy sweater.” Comfortability’s constant use on reality TV usually concerns relationships and connections, suggesting a distinction between emotional comfort and physical comfort. But Fairbanks said she also hears the word frequently on TikTok Shop, where it’s used in the context of selling clothes, creating a strange confluence between stretchy pants and feelings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe it’s not all that surprising that comfortability has become popular in the specific realms it has, reality TV chief among them. Today, “we have more access to video of people speaking casually” than we ever have before, Aleksic pointed out, resulting in a “wealth of informal language being used daily.” As Holliday put it, “There are all these people that need to talk about their feelings on TV. And so they’re just noun-ing adjectives because they’re talking so much. Same thing on TikTok, and the same thing with sports commentators. Announcers aren’t gonna go to the dictionary. Reality TV stars aren’t gonna go to the dictionary. And they shouldn’t, because we all know what they mean.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we get the gist, why does comfortability still feel to some of us like a slow-motion tragedy, the next literally happening before our eyes? Why do some modifications of language strike us as clever and innovative and some, like this one, as, well, dumb? Though it isn’t just that it sounds dumb—lots of things sound dumb. I think what really offends us might be that it sounds dumb in the service of trying to sound smart. It always carries with it a whiff of bullshit.\n\nRelated From Slate I Spent a Day Looking Only at What Donald Trump Fans See Online. Sure Does Look Nice From Here. Read More\n\nTo linguists, being bugged by comfortability isn’t any different or more noble than being bugged by any other new word or language trend. Ultimately, “people hate new words,” Holliday said. “They hate language change, but they really hate language change when they think it’s coming from the bottom up, as opposed to the top down, in society.” Hearing the word in such unsophisticated settings as reality TV and social media might be making us that much more judgmental.\n\nHolliday added, “In this particular case, there’s no reason that it couldn’t have been comfortability 700 years ago. That could be the old form and the new form could be comfortableness. These things are somewhat interchangeable when you are trying to noun an adjective, and so any sort of emotional attachment that somebody has to the old form as opposed to the new form is also only because it’s old. There’s nothing linguistically real there.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFellow haters, I know this is hard to hear. If it’s any consolation, linguists aren’t sure whether comfortability will stick around. “We do see this 10- or 20-year increase in comfortability,” but, Holliday said, “it’s totally possible that by 2030 nobody’s ever saying it again. What predicts that is whether it develops a shade of meaning different than comfortableness, which I would argue that it seems to be developing.”\n\nAs for Stuber, the professor in Arkansas, he told me he’s been hearing the word a lot since he brought it up in class—mostly because his students have been “relentlessly trolling” him with it: “I’ve received a number of emails that use the word comfortability.” It’s done nothing for his comfort.",

        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Baseball’s about to get started again, but before the Cubs and Dodgers take the field in the Tokyo Dome on Tuesday, let’s take one more look back at last season, when baseball history was made, a decades-old record was smashed—and nobody noticed.\n\nI’m talking about the Baltimore Orioles who, in 2024, hit into 71 double plays.\n\nQuick explainer: A double play happens when the batter hits a ball, typically weakly and on the ground, and not only does he get thrown out, but his teammate who was already on base gets thrown out as well. It’s the most demoralizing thing that happens on a baseball field, snuffing out a promising rally in an instant. So fewer is better.\n\nThe 2024 Orioles’ 71 is the lowest full-season total in the history of Major League Baseball. No team hit into that few double plays when they only played 154 games. No team hit into that few double plays when they all wore wool pants. In fact, no team had ever hit into fewer than 75 double plays, a record set by the 1945 St. Louis Cardinals and equaled by the 2021 Tampa Bay Rays. The 2024 Orioles were, by a handsome margin, the best baseball team at not hitting into a double play that there has ever been.\n\nYou didn’t hear about this on ESPN or in the New York Times. You didn’t even hear about it from the Orioles themselves. That’s because they didn’t know. Sig Mejdal, the Orioles’ vice president and assistant general manager, told me he knew the team’s avoidance of the DP was a strength, but he didn’t totally believe me that the team had set an all-time record until he looked it up himself. “The people I’ve mentioned it to were quite surprised,” he told me.\n\nWhat made the Orioles so good at not grounding into double plays? History offers little guidance. The list of least-GIDP-ing teams in history has good teams, like the 100-win 2021 Rays (75 DP), and lousy teams, like the 99-loss 1967 Royals (79 DP). Some of these teams didn’t hit into a lot of double plays because they barely ever had a man on first (1967 Royals again).* Some of them, like the 1986 Cardinals (83 DP), stole tons of bases, which reduces the number of DP situations. But the 2024 Orioles had plenty of singles and walks, and not a lot of steals. They did hit the ball with elevation; their ground ball percentage of 40.3 percent was fourth-lowest in the majors. But that means three other teams hit even fewer ground balls, and yet many more of those turned into double plays. Frankly, I’m stumped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair to every other baseball team in history, double plays around the league are in modest decline. There were just 0.66 per team, per game in 2024, the lowest total in decades. Maybe this has something to do with the banning of the shift, or the rule allowing video review of the “neighborhood play” (otherwise known as the “We’ll just say the second baseman touched the bag because he had the vibes of having touched the bag” play).\n\nRelated From Slate The Best Baseball Movie in Years Is Also a Perfect Hangout Movie Read More\n\nBut does it matter? We don’t discount the slugging accomplishments of Pete Alonso or Aaron Judge because they play in the homer-happy 21st century. Every team had the opportunity to hit into the fewest double plays ever. Only the Orioles did it.\n\nIt’s not quite fair how unheralded this was. We pay attention to things that happen, especially when they happen unusually often or with unusual force. But we neglect the negative space of things that spectacularly, extraordinarily fail to happen. Those things are important! Nowhere more so than in baseball. Is there any moment more characteristic of the sport than the 3–2 count with the bases loaded in a tie game, when the whole stadium goes elbow-to-knee to see if the batter can successfully not hit the ball, successfully not even try to hit the ball, winning the game thereby?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnybody can cheer for Judge whanging his 50-somethingth ball into the stands. It takes a little connoisseurship to follow a reliever’s scoreless-inning streak, or Luis Arráez going a whole month without striking out, or Jim Palmer facing a bases-loaded jam 213 times in his 19-year career and never once giving up a grand slam. Or the Orioles, coming up again and again with a runner on first and less than two outs and managing not to weakly ground-ball their way out of a rally.\n\nRegression to the mean spares no one, and the 2025 Orioles will likely hit into more double plays than they did in 2024. But let’s pledge to go into the new season with a conscious appreciation of their achievement. I can’t wait to see what they don’t do this year.",

I have no idea why, unless she resents that I’m at least as skilled and valued an employee as she is, despite not being skinny or “hot.” Our company’s summer picnic was our first in-person family party since pre-COVID, and Vanessa met my husband for the first time. Since then, she has not shut up about how cute he is and the things she’d like to do to him. I suspect this is partly if not solely to screw with me, since my husband does not seem like Vanessa’s usual type. I would go to HR, except our HR manager is a close friend of Vanessa’s, so I’m afraid that might impact me worse than her.\n\nVanessa and her long-term boyfriend are in an open relationship, a fact she is extremely candid about. She wants me to tell my husband that she’d like to have a threesome with him and one of her hot, younger girlfriends. She swears this would just be a one-time thing and completely consensual and aboveboard. If I won’t tell him, she wants me to give her his cell number so she can get in touch with him herself. She keeps repeating that if I won’t at least let her put the offer to him, it means I don’t trust him and my marriage is a sham.\n\nPrudie, my husband and I have been married 13 years, we have three kids under 10, we love each other to death, we’re monogamous and have always been faithful … but I can’t be 1000 percent sure he’d say no to a one-time threesome with two gorgeous women if I left it completely up to him. Is there any merit at all to Vanessa’s assertions that this means we’re better off divorced? What should I do?\n\n— Trouble Trusting This\n\nDear Trouble Trusting,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Vanessa in fact resents you for doing your job while not being skinny and wants to mess with you as a result, well 1) that’s disgusting, and 2) she’s unfortunately succeeded. The fact that you’re even considering this absolutely unhinged bully’s view of your marriage is evidence that this situation is way out of control, and you need a reset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst step: Put a stop to this. Here’s your script. “Vanessa, I’ve been entertaining your comments for too long. I want you to know that what you’ve said about having sex with husband makes me uncomfortable and is totally inappropriate for work. Please limit your conversations with me to professional matters and don’t mention my relationship or my personal life again.” If you truly don’t trust HR, I’ll take your word for it. But document your exchange with her just in case you do need to get someone else involved in the future. Because this feels a lot like it’s getting into sexual harassment territory, and if it doesn’t stop, you may need to take more aggressive action.\n\nNext step: Get a hold of yourself. You have allowed her to walk all over you and make you question your marriage, despite knowing, on some level, that her motivation is to harm you. You need to speak to someone who has your best interest in mind—whether it’s a close friend, your husband, or a therapist—to reassure yourself that a random, disturbed work frenemy doesn’t have any standing to determine the fate of your marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am attending a wedding with a formal dress code. I don’t know the bride very well, none of us do. The groom is a longtime friend of my husband and our circle of friends. We are happy to attend, but the dress code makes me nervous. I have never attended a formal event before and I bought a dress for the occasion. Now, I’m scared to be overdressed. I don’t feel close enough to the bride to ask her advice and besides, it is too late now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to admit the dress is gorgeous. Navy blue with a champagne jupon. Age appropriate (I’m 45), discreet accessories, sober shoes. Thing is: Is this what she meant by formal or did I go a bit too far? To me, it feels like I’m dressed for the red carpet or a ball at Versailles. On the other hand, my husband is one of the groomsmen, and I know how much he had to pay for his suit. I felt a pressure to match the price range. I may have taken that as a guide for my own shopping. Was I wrong? Is it better to be underdressed or overdressed at such an event?\n\n— Overdressed in Montreal\n\nDear Overdressed,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle “formal wedding guest dresses” and see if yours looks reasonably similar to the images that pop up. I’m sure it will. Also, even if it’s a little too formal: Not a big deal. (Too white? Potentially a problem. Too revealing? Maybe something guests will whisper about. But the worst thing people are going to think about you being “too formal” for a formal wedding is “Wow she looks really nice … I wonder when they’re going to cut the cake.” Yes, as I’ve mentioned before, I’m convinced most wedding guests spend significant energy anticipating the cake.) While I don’t think matching the price range is necessarily the right way to think about this, it is better to be overdressed than to be underdressed. It shows you care.\n\nThat said, it sounds like you’re super anxious about how you’ll look. If you go through the Googling exercise and you still don’t feel comfortable, don’t wear the gorgeous gown. Not because you shouldn’t, but because you’ll be all preoccupied, taking stock of everyone else’s clothes and trying to figure out if anyone is wearing a jupon (full disclosure: I had to look up “jupon”) as ornate as yours, or if you’re the only one who looks like you’re going to a ball at Versailles when you’re supposed to be listening to your husband’s groomsman speech and small-talking about how beautiful the bride looks. This will ruin the evening for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut can I weigh in on a larger issue, too? Men are allowed to communicate about weddings. Your husband is close friends with the groom. You know the “Hey, is this the look you were thinking of when you set the formal dress code?” text you might have sent if you were close to the bride? He could have fired that off to his friend, who is one of the two people in charge of the vision for this event. And you could have had a quick, clear answer. In fact, you still could!\n\nHow to Get Advice From Prudie\n\nSubmit your questions anonymously here. (Questions may be edited for publication.) Join the live chat every Monday at noon (and submit your comments) here.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nThe time has come for us to submit photos to our senior yearbook. Our friend group has pretty bad luck with taking photos, and we have very few good ones. I was scrolling through and I found the needle in the haystack photo: all of us are included, it’s fairly recent, and we all look pretty good. I sent it to the group chat, and everyone loves it and wants to use it except for “Gemma.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGemma is not letting us use it because of a relatively minor concern with how she looks in it (think being a bit bloated after a meal). I understand that we all have our insecurities and am against using the photo if she is this uncomfortable, but I really don’t know what other options I have. I truly wouldn’t even suggest the photo if I thought it was unflattering to anyone, and everyone in our group is saying over and over again how great she looks in it. All the ones she suggests don’t include everyone, and I don’t want to exclude someone else from the photo because Gemma is being a bit difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe’ve tried reasoning with her (she looks great, the photo will be super tiny on the page, we can dim it) but she is firmly against it. I don’t want to put a picture in without her as that would feel a bit shady (we are really close), and I don’t have enough space for two. The deadline is nearing, and I don’t know if I should bother talking to her or if I’m really in the wrong here. What should I do?\n\n— Not Smiling for the Cameras\n\nDear Not Smiling,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGemma is going to look back at this picture years from now and realize she looked fantastic and have a major moment of regret around not appreciating it at the time. She’s going to wish it was both in the yearbook and on a large billboard. But there’s nothing you can do to get her to see that now. Find a different picture—or better yet, make a collage that combines photos that everyone in the group loves. And put this one in a frame in your bedroom.\n\nMeanwhile, remember that while end-of-high-school traditions can feel hugely consequential, you have already made the memories that are going to stay with you forever. And whether your friendships survive and thrive into adulthood will depend on the energy you put into staying connected when you all go your separate ways. In other words, worry less about how you’re all pictured together and more about how you really are together. That could start with honoring Gemma’s wishes now, even if you think she’s being unreasonable. You have my permission to tell her “I told you so” at your 20-year reunion, when I’m sure she’ll happily allow you to submit the shot to the slideshow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nA close childhood friend of mine, “Anna,” has been struggling with infertility. We both married our spouses in early 2019, and they began trying for a baby on their honeymoon. My husband and I held off due to the pandemic and started trying after we’d received our COVID-19 jabs. We were fortunate to get pregnant right away. Unfortunately, Anna has had the opposite experience and has since tried multiple rounds of IVF. I have tried to keep my pregnancy updates, details about our baby boy, and talk about becoming a mum as infrequent as possible. I purposely don’t bring up my son as often as I would with other friends in order to be sensitive to her feelings. She claims she’s happy for me, but it’s hard for her to hear about my pregnancy and newborn, which I understand.\n\nBefore I had my son, she was forthcoming about her infertility struggles, and I provided a shoulder to lean on and ear to listen whenever she wanted to talk. I checked in on how she was doing regularly, and have continued to do so, but ever since my son was born she has shut me out. She met him once when he was a few weeks old but shortly after had another unsuccessful round of IVF. I have tried to contact her many times about a funny program or good book I’ve read (any topics far from mum life/pregnancy) and have seemingly been ghosted. If she responds she’s quite short. My heart hurts for her and I really, really miss my friend. There’s nothing I want more than for her to have the pregnancy and motherhood experience she so desires. But I’m at a loss as to how to proceed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have had a chat where I told her I wanted to be sensitive to her circumstances and have tried to initiate conversations without bringing up my son or how much my life has changed. It’s been difficult, as I was diagnosed with postnatal depression, which I felt I was unable to confide in her as I would never want to cause her any additional hurt or pain. I have since opened up to her about my diagnosis and mental health, but it was a difficult conversation. Throughout my pregnancy I felt overwhelming guilt and anxiety at having gotten pregnant so quickly and even more so now that my son is nearly four months old. Aside from a birth announcement, I have avoided sharing photos and updates of my son on social media, as she has mentioned in the past that pregnancy and baby posts are difficult for her. I’m currently on leave through the end of the year and am therefore unable to facilitate the typical back and forth regarding work, though I’ve made it a point to ask how her recent promotion has been going.\n\nIt’s been nearly a month since we last spoke, and our phone conversation was awkward and stilted at best. She has not responded to my messages since. What can I do to mend our relationship? I’m hesitant to have another “I’m here for you” chat as she has expressed she does not want sympathy and prefers I not ask how she’s faring. Yet my attempts at otherwise innocuous conversation have been met with a brick wall. We have been close since primary school, I consider her to be the sister I never had, and I really don’t want this to end our decades-old friendship.\n\n— New Mum Missing Her Best Friend\n\nDear New Mum,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I started reading your question I was like, “Oh good, I have a few ideas here: Check in on her to see how she’s doing. Share that you’re having a difficult time too. Minimize the baby updates. Remind her that you’re there for her. Talk about lighthearted stuff. Ask about other important areas of her life.” And then … it turned out that you’d already tried them all. This is really tough.\n\nSo, I want to suggest a script that gets at all the issues you’ve mentioned about how much you value the relationship, but also puts the ball a little more in her court. “Hi Friend, it’s been a while since we talked. I know you’re doing through so much with infertility and IVF right now, and I’ve been dealing with my own struggles with my mental health. I just want to say I miss you so much, and I don’t want us to drift apart during this hard time. But I also don’t want to put any pressure on you to stay in touch if it’s too difficult. So I’m going to keep checking in with you every once in a while about non-baby stuff, just to let you know I’m thinking about you. If you don’t reply, it’s okay. If that annoys you let me know, otherwise I’ll just keep reminding you that I’m here. And whenever you are feeling like talking about light or heavy topics, or if you need something from me, just reach out and know that we can pick up where we left off the minute you’re ready.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, to the extent you can, put this aside. I know it’s hard, but you can’t force her to want to be close right now. And you don’t want your relationship (or lack thereof) with her to dominate this time in your life. Allow her retreat to make room for other people who would love to be close to you and support you during what’s been a really challenging period.\n\nYou’ve spent a lot of time focused on her feelings and struggles, but you also have your own very legitimate ones, and you deserve the same kind of extremely thoughtful support that you’ve been offering up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence Uncensored\n\nHelp! My Oldest Friend Has Shut Me Out Now That I’m a Mom.\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris and friends discuss a letter in this week’s Dear Prudence Uncensored—only for Slate Plus members.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\n“Jane” and I have been friends for almost 20 years, the longest I’ve ever kept a friendship going. We have a number of interests in common, but our core values do tend to be different. I’m a bleeding-heart liberal, pansexual, polyamorous woman; and she’s conservative, traditionally Christian, and straight. I valued her friendship because of these differences, and because we could discuss them respectfully. And because she’s a compassionate person, who can accept people who disagree with her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, so I thought. I recently got an email from her saying that we should part ways as friends because our core values are too far apart. She even gave examples that include some hurtful assumptions on her part—I have no idea what I could have said that makes her think I’m against free speech—as well as some that make me wonder if she ever really knew me. I sent her a reply telling her that I don’t like it but she’s gotta do what she’s gotta do, and that I hope she has a good life. But the more I think about it, the more I want to talk to her about it. This is all complicated by the fact that she suffers from manic-depression, and this coming out of the blue makes me worry that she’s having a meltdown. I have no way of getting in touch with her family or I’d give them a heads-up to check on her and leave it at that. Do I try to contact her to ask if she’s okay? Do I try to have a discussion and salvage a relationship I think is worth saving? Or do I just process the loss and let it go?\n\n— Not Ready to Say Goodbye\n\nDear Say Goodbye,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you valued her because she could accept people who disagreed with her. But now she can’t. So the best case scenario, if you’re able to salvage this relationship, is that you have a friend who doesn’t actually have the qualities you think she had and who has said she doesn’t respect your values, and that friend may be having a meltdown that you’re powerless to help with. I don’t know that you actually have the option to salvage the relationship, even if you very much wanted to. Let it go.\n\nGive Prudie a Hand in “We’re Prudence”\n\nSometimes even Prudence needs a little help. Every Thursday in this column, we’ll post a question that has her stumped. This week’s tricky situation is below. Join the conversation about it on Twitter with Jenée @jdesmondharris on Thursday, and then look back for the final answer here on Friday.\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nMy partner and I were lucky to find a home in a sleepy neighborhood, with mostly nice and friendly neighbors. We’re not super social people, but we’ve enjoyed getting to know our neighbors, and feel glad to have largely positive friendships with folks close by who can sometimes lend a cup of flour, pick up a piece of mail, or water your plants when you’re out of town for a few days. We are, of course, happy to return these favors and are often asked to house or pet-sit for neighbors who are away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is one household who we pet-sit for. These are otherwise kind and reasonable people, but it has become clear that they don’t place a lot of value on hygiene in their home or for their animals. Think: bugs in the pet food, dried up feces on the floor, litter pans and food dishes crusted over, open bags of used litter sitting around, stacks of papers falling, and more. We’re asked to pet-sit more than a dozen times a year, and this problem is escalating to the point where it’s upsetting to see and smell their animals living in such conditions. It seems like the health of the animals is declining as well. Sometimes we’re asked to pet-sit for weeks at a time!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat can be done in this situation so we don’t ruin the relationship with these neighbors? We don’t mind the occasional pet-sitting, but this has become uncomfortable and troubling given the frequency with which we’re asked to help out. If it’s rude to comment on other people’s parenting, it’s probably rude to say something about how they keep their home and animals–right? What’s a socially acceptable way to move forward here, knowing we’re going to get another spur of the moment text to pet-sit soon?\n\n— Smelly House, Why Aren’t They Cleaning You?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am a man in my mid-twenties. Over the years I have joined a spiritual community in which we are able to ask someone to be our spiritual mentor. My mentor and I have had a close relationship over many years and developed a friendship as a result. One thing I have always struggled with was my body image. While I was only slightly overweight in middle school, I was constantly made fun of for being fat. This created much anxiety in me. Friends and family would make fun of my weight in public, monitor my food intake, and tell me how what I would eat would make me gain weight. Despite getting into weight training and losing the weight, these comments continued well into my twenties. As a result, I began to develop an unhealthy relationship with food and exercise where I would over-exercise to the point of injury, and have incredible anxiety over having a cookie. I would not go out to eat at restaurants, and I would obsess over how much I ate or how I looked. Last year, I realized how much control this had had over my life and truly began to change my relationship with food. I saw that my view of my body was distorted, especially as I was in very good shape and had weighed the same since high school (165-170 lbs.). Where before eating a piece of bread would cause me to emotionally spiral, I now enjoy all types of food and now go by moderation as opposed to rigid diets. I feel much happier as a result as well because I love food! I still get the occasional comment of being fat by strangers, which I attribute to their own issues now. I feel that I made a lot of progress!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mentor had been instrumental in helping me with my distorted issues around my body and I was incredibly thankful. Until recently, that is: I was over at his house when his partner asked me a question about pizza. When I enthusiastically shared with him a recommendation, my mentor called out that if I kept eating pizza I was going to get fat when I am older especially because I was short (I’m 5’9”). I was dumbstruck. I said that my eating habits work for me, and I feel as if I have it under control. He began to argue with me. I could feel myself getting angry, and I said that we could agree to disagree about my eating habits and I quickly left. A couple of days later I called him and said that I felt hurt by his comment as this was an issue I still was working through. He got upset with me and said I was overreacting to an offhand comment he had made and that I obviously have not recovered in this area of my life. Afterwards, he said we could not hang out together since I am too sensitive to offhand comments. I ended up ending the mentor relationship later over some of his bigoted viewpoints, however I am still haunted. Was I overreacting to this entire situation? How can I even tell?\n\n— A Weighty Issue\n\nDear Weighty Issue,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don’t know what one has to do to become a “spiritual mentor,” but I can’t imagine that “making your mentee feel worse” and “being cruel in response to totally reasonable feedback” are part of the job. In fact, I’m pretty sure these things should be disqualifying. And he has other bigoted views, too?? Uh, no, you didn’t overreact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis guy was a fraud and a bad person. It sounds like you’ve done amazing work to overcome the abuse you endured around food and your body. The way you stood up for yourself is a testament to that. Keep doing what you’re doing, and take what you need from this spiritual community while remembering that the other people in it are only human and shouldn’t be listened to over your own instincts and hard-won wisdom.\n\nClassic Prudie\n\nMy grandmother once had a diamond necklace that was a family heirloom. My grandfather, who didn’t know how to keep things in his pants, ended up giving it to one of his mistresses. My grandmother mourned the loss of the necklace until the day she died. Recently, I happened to stumble across the necklace, or what I think is the necklace, on eBay. I questioned my grandfather and contacted the seller, and both parties think it’s possible this necklace belonged to my grandmother …",

At the same time, judges and courts around the country are handing out temporary restraining orders and injunctions, and they are reinstating government workers fired without cause. On Saturday night, the equal and opposite reactions reached a constitutional crisis point with D.C. District Court Judge James Boasberg ordering planes carrying hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to be turned around to comply with immigration law, and the Trump administration celebrating their noncompliance. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick turned to Preet Bharara to discuss this law-to-lawlessness axis and the paradox that the law is political except for when it’s not political. Bharara is a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York; before that he was chief counsel to Sen. Chuck Schumer, and he is now a distinguished scholar in residence and adjunct professor of law at New York University School of Law. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: Lawyers always live on the line between politics and the law, but I think that’s been especially true for you. Most of your career has been an effort to stay on the law side of that line really mindfully and purposefully, whether that was investigating the U.S. attorneys scandal for the Justice Department or getting jammed by political demands at the start of the first Trump administration. Help me understand whether that line between law and politics is just imaginary, or if in fact what we have learned in the first seven weeks of Trump 2.0 is—that politics is just everything.\n\nPreet Bharara: Any line, whether it’s a statute, a regulation, a guideline, a rule, can be blurred into complete indistinction unless the people who are subject to those lines care about them, and enforce them properly, and inhabit the roles that they’re supposed to inhabit. If there’s a line between this and that, that’s enshrined in statute. If a prosecutor decides they don’t want to prosecute it, then that line doesn’t really matter anymore with respect to the conduct that it attempts to reach. Has it been obliterated? No. Is it being blurred further? Absolutely. Yes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has always been popular, and continues to be popular, to make fun of lawyers, to deride lawyers, to denigrate lawyers, and I get that we deserve a lot of what we get. But so many things are dependent on lawyers—trained professionals with access to the courts, who are officers of the court, who act in good faith within the rule of law—no matter what side of the political spectrum you find yourself. If you want accountability, it will take a lawyer. If you want to be made whole, it takes a lawyer. If you want to vindicate your civil rights, it takes a lawyer. If you want to hold politicians to account, it may take a lawyer. If you want to make sure there’s less corruption on Wall Street, it may take a lawyer. If you want to correct a wrong or an injustice, if you want to get someone innocent out of prison—although it may have been lawyers who are the cause of that miscarriage of justice—it will take lawyers to get them out.\n\nI don’t mean to be self-indulgent about the profession, but they are really important cogs in the massive system of law and politics that you describe. How they conduct themselves, how they are monitored, overseen, and on other occasions chilled from doing what they’re supposed to, and what our system needs them to do—that’s all really important stuff.\n\nNow I want to ask you a big existential question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShould I quote from Camus? The law died today. Or was it yesterday?\n\nThat may be where we’re headed. But I’m hearing a lot of people saying words to the effect of “I’m just going to kind of lean back because the courts have got this,” and then that turns into lighting the Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh votive candles. We’re in this paradox, which is related to the law/politics paradox, where we’re too in love with the law as the fix here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate A Dangerous New Supreme Court Case Could Open the Door to Prosecutions for DEI Read More\n\nI think it’s hugely important that lawyers are saying “I’m in it. I’m going to fight this.” And so important that we’ve got judges effectively saying to the administration, “Get outta here with your lying lies.” But I wonder if, at the same time, we’re training the public to believe too much that the courts alone can solve this authoritarianism/illiberalism crisis.\n\nWhat is the role for a public that maybe still doesn’t quite understand that there’s a lot of runway beyond which law and the courts can’t go, and how do we think about that in a moment when the law has surged into the breach?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis answer may not endear me to anyone. There was a time for that, and it was called the 2024 election. I said repeatedly, as did others, that the cases involving Donald Trump are important, and the rule of law is important, but there’s a mass of people in the country who looked at the legal process—whether it was the Manhattan DA’s case or special counsel Jack Smith—as a replacement for the ballot. They believed those cases were going to be manna from heaven, and would be their saviors, when that could only happen at the ballot box. And it failed at the ballot box.\n\nWe just talked about these lines in the law, and how the lines don’t matter if people don’t observe them, that they’re not self-executing. What causes people to observe the lines is the public’s reaction. In other words, if the public lets it slide that a senator from their state, who may be Republican, doesn’t exercise his or her constitutional authority as a member of a coequal branch of government to do the right thing, then the law tends not to matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second impeachment of Donald Trump was a legal proceeding. It was a constitutional legal proceeding, and there were rules and there were precedents, and I believe, truly, if there could have been an anonymous vote, Trump would not have been allowed to return to office. But they fell a few votes short. You can blame the senators if you want, but I think there’s an argument that you’ve got to look deeper. It seems to me that this is the great worry that your question presents: Even if the courts rule a certain way that’s consistent with the rule of law, and protective of American democracy, and the interests that are at stake in a particular case, if that decision is ignored, we are in the shit. But if there’s hell to pay for ignoring a judicial order, then it won’t be ignored. If everyone is going to be thrown out of office, if there’s going to be a landslide victory in the opposite direction (which is what I would think should happen), then the orders aren’t ignored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat’s why I’m worried about all these attacks on judges and calls for impeaching judges they don’t like, or demands for other kinds of limitations on the courts. I worry that some of that is an intentional or unintentional testing of the waters to see: “What would happen if a judge rules against us and we don’t want to listen to it?” If the public doesn’t care, if the public’s not going to turn people out of office, if senators are not getting mail, they’re not getting phone calls about it, then it can be done. People have to pay attention. People can’t tune out. People have to be involved and they have to make their anger known.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe started this conversation saying “All of law is politics, except when it’s not.” But now you’re making me think of the fact that confirmation hearings are quasi-legal, quasi-political actions, so was the impeachment, and so are these intensely political legal cases arising from all the executive orders and actions. All these are very much both legal and political. And I think that the space in which the public has to really get in the game is reckoning with the fact that this is not a situation in which the public’s role is to just sort of lay back and let the judges handle this. There is actually learned helplessness in asking the question “Is this a constitutional crisis?” And then, “I’m going to wait for a law professor to tell me if it is.” Right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook, the fields are empty this time around. I’m not blaming anyone. I’m not casting aspersions on hardworking folks who have had enough, but the fields were full of protesters the first time out. You don’t have that now.\n\nYou’re not the first person who has used the term learned helplessness. Abraham Lincoln said, and Nancy Pelosi cited it all the time: “With public sentiment, anything is possible. Without it, nothing is possible.” That goes gangbusters for these issues too. The reason why these Republican senators are so craven is because they know that the opposite reaction will happen, that the people in their district will rise up if they take a position contrary to Trump. That’s why Liz Cheney lost by like 4 billion votes, even though there were not 4 billion people in her district. The power imbalance was that more voting humans were prepared to throw out someone like Liz Cheney than keep Liz Cheney in, for the sin of pointing out (honorably) the legal, moral, and constitutional failings of the sitting president of the United States. So long as that continues to be the case, we’re in trouble.",

        "title": "October 8: New film about “American antisemitism” is really about something else.",
        "source": "https://slate.com/",
        "content": "Last week, the mayor of Miami Beach threatened to shut down a movie theater showing the Israeli–Palestinian documentary No Other Land, the latest in a series of attacks on the film that have escalated since it won an Oscar earlier this month. On Tuesday, Mayor Steven Meiner sent a newsletter denouncing the film as “a false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people,” and a few days later he introduced legislation to terminate the lease of South Beach’s O Cinema, which rents space in the former city hall, and cancel an outstanding $40,000 in municipal grants. One city commissioner called the film, which was shot entirely in the Masafer Yatta region of the West Bank, “pro Hamas/ terrorist propaganda,” while another labeled it “a propaganda-driven, one-sided narrative that falsely depicts Israel as the aggressor.”\n\nMeanwhile, one mile away at the Regal South Beach, another documentary opened on Friday without a hint of controversy. It’s one of more than 100 theaters in the U.S. showing October 8, director Wendy Sachs’ chronicle of the rise in antisemitism in the U.S. following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks in which more than a thousand Israelis were killed and hundreds taken hostage. The movie, which took in more than $200,000 at the box office this weekend, offers devastating testimony from survivors of the now-abandoned Nir Oz kibbutz, which lost 41 of its 420 residents in the raid plus many more who were killed in captivity, and upsetting reminders of incidents like the joint statement signed by nearly three-dozen Harvard student groups that held “the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence” and neglected to so much as mention the hundreds of Israeli civilians who were killed, raped, and mutilated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut October 8 isn’t a movie about the battles in Israel and Palestine; it’s about the culture war in the U.S. And despite the occasional token nod to alternate points of view, it’s far more nakedly propagandistic than No Other Land. Although its interview subjects are identified with fairly nondescript captions—Blake Flayton, a founder of the student group New Zionist Congress and a co-host of the podcast We Should All Be Zionists, is identified simply as “writer”—the movie’s ideological leanings become clear when the second talking head that pops up belongs to Shai Davidai, the assistant professor who was banned from the Columbia University campus for “repeatedly harass[ing] and intimid[ating] university employees.” Among other things, Davidai accused Columbia professor Rashid Khalidi, a Palestinian, of being “a spokesperson for Hamas.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile podcaster and former Romney adviser Dan Senor allows that it is possible to criticize the conduct of Israel’s government without shading into antisemitism, the movie makes no effort to preserve that distinction. Phrases like “pro-Palestinian, pro-Hamas,” and “pro-Hamas, pro-resistance” fly by so frequently and so quickly that you could almost be forgiven for losing sight of the difference, especially when there’s footage from American protests of people on Oct. 8, 2023, proclaiming that “all of us here are proud of what happened yesterday.” Sachs creates powerful emotional associations by, in one case, cutting from footage of Nazi death camps to a shot of charred bodies on Oct. 7, the deadliest single day for Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose kinds of juxtapositions can be extremely effective on film, especially in a theater where there’s no opportunity to double-check their validity. But some of its claims are, at least, more complex than that are made out to be. Did an associate professor at Cornell who was suspended and then welcomed back to campus really say he was “exhilarated” by the Oct. 7 attacks? Not exactly, or at least not without also condemning violence and the targeting of civilians. A quick sequence showing scenes of global terrorist attacks claims to show the spreading influence of Hamas, but at least one of them, the Paris attacks of November 2015, were openly denounced by the group. These might be fine distinctions, but the movie’s willingness to brush past them casts its overarching argument into doubt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat argument emerges only slowly, through fleeting but telling references that expand the scope of its culture-war targets. Flayton appears just long enough to make the claim that “one of the greatest perpetrators of antisemitism is, if not officially DEI, the ideology of DEI,” without sticking around long enough to explain what that means, and historian Asaf Romirowsky says that the concept of intersectionality has “hijacked every underdog cause in the world.” But it’s not until perhaps an hour in that October 8 makes what turns out to be its pivotal point. Israeli actress and author Noa Tishby walks us through the historical evolution of antisemitism from an ideology based in religious hatred to one centered on racial extermination. But in the present, she argues, it takes a more insidious, even fashionable form, especially among campus leftists: anti-Zionism. As Tishby wrote shortly before the Oct. 7 attacks, she regards anti-Zionizm as “antisemitism 2.0.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd with that, October 8’s project snaps into focus, as does its place in a larger cultural and political context. Although some of the movie’s subjects note that criticizing the state of Israel’s conduct is not the same as questioning its right to exist, no criticisms of Israel’s conduct are raised. Protestors are characterized as unwitting terrorist dupes and overt sympathizers—the same McCarthyite logic that the Trump administration is using to deport lawful U.S. residents for being “pro-Hamas.” The movie’s tenuously related criticisms of DEI and intersectionality likewise find their way into Trump’s all-out assault on higher education, using a purported concern about antisemitism as the pretext for gutting the perceived havens of radical left-wing thought. (If the concern were more genuine, one might expect less hiring of conspiracy theorists with long histories of antisemitic statements to critical government positions.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated From Slate If Trump Can Target Mahmoud Khalil for Free Speech, He Can Come After Anyone Read More\n\nThose conflations and oversimplifications aren’t unique to one side. When the masked Columbia protestors in October 8 bar people from entering the campus with the words “No Zionists allowed,” the difference between ideology and identity feels like an awfully flimsy one. But there are plenty of thoughtful critics of Zionism, among them No Other Land’s Jewish co-director Yuval Abraham, and excluding their voices and their place in political movements raises questions October 8 has no intention of answering. Still, the movie is hugely enlightening, if not solely for the reasons it means to be. While it’s convenient for the current administration to label any pro-Palestine protestor, especially those with green cards or on student visas, an antisemite, they tend to make their case through brute-force assertion rather than laying out the argument in full. October 8 says it loud and clear.",
